10,000 Americans within the next two years, as well as open four hubs within the U.S., starting in Indiana this summer.\nAnd unlike with previous press announcements from companies like Sprint and GM,

initiating a government review that is expected to make it harder for companies to obtain H-1B visas for workers who might undercut American labor.\nWhile tech companies throughout Silicon Valley rely heavily on the H-1B program, which is designed to allow high-skill workers to enter the United States, <mark>Trump</mark>'s directive is expected to focus on restricting visas at the lower end of the skill spectrum, disproportionately affecting call-center companies like Infosys.\nVishal Sikka offered Reuters a comment on the move that sounded like it could have been dictated by <mark>Trump</mark> himself: \"When you think about it from a U.S. point of view, obviously creating more American jobs and opportunities is a good thing .\"\nWhile the move isn't guaranteed to get Infosys out of

<mark>May</mark> said MPs had made clear what they did not want when they rejected her Withdrawal Agreement by a 230-vote margin earlier this month, but now it was time for them to tell Brussels what they do want.\nThe Commons chamber was packed as the day's debate on Brexit began (PA) In an attempt to fend off possible rebellion by Tories seeking to avoid a no-deal departure, Mrs <mark>May</mark> promised that Tuesday's votes would not be MPs' final chance to pass judgment on EU withdrawal.\nMrs <mark>May</mark> acknowledged that the Commons defeat of the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with EU leaders last November had been \"decisive\".\nA cross-party amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper was selected for debate (PA) Mrs <mark>May</mark> said it was time for Parliament to \"speak as one\".\n\"Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s hopes of securing a majority for the Brady amendment were boosted when former foreign secretary and Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson said he would\" gladly \"vote for it, if it meant legally binding changes to the backstop.\nMrs <mark>May</mark> is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening.\n\"But Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s official spokesman said:\" There is a very clear message from the EU's leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.\n\"(PA Graphics) Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs <mark>May</mark> on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment.\nBut it was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the 118 Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s deal on January 15.\nRemain-backing Tories <mark>may</mark> rally behind the Cooper-Boles amendment, while other proposals <mark>may</mark> gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit.\nMPs rejected <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of 230 votes earlier this month (Mark Duffy/UK Parliament/PA) Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party."}, {"articleID": "2015100512_00084155_W", "names":
