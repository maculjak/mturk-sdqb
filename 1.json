Shale company Cuadrilla saw an application to frack and test the flow of gas from up to four exploration wells at each of two sites between Blackpool and Preston refused earlier this year by Lancashire County Council. The firm has appealed against the planning decision, made after officials for the council recommended a scheme at Roseacre Wood should be turned down on traffic impact grounds, but a site at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton should get the go-ahead. Loading article content The appeal is due to be heard by a planning inspector at a public inquiry next February, but the Government has decided Communities Secretary <mark> Greg Clark </mark> will make the decision because the proposals are \"of more than local significance\" . A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"Ministers have decided to recover Cuadrilla's appeals for shale exploration in Lancashire.\" They consider these proposals are of more than local significance and raise important issues of planning development control. \"The Government's intention to take over decision-making from local councils on planning applications for fracking was first announced in the summer, as ministers try to get the UK shale industry off the ground. The Government has said it is going\" all out for shale \", but oil and gas companies keen to exploit the resource have come up against local opposition, with councils turning down applications in potential shale areas including Lancashire and Sussex. Mr <mark> Clark </mark>'s decision to call in the planning application is in contrast to its stance on onshore wind farms, where local people have been given the final say on developments in their areas. Promoted stories Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy said:\" It's hypocritical for ministers to support devolution and local democracy for decision-making over wind farms, only to then trample over the views of local communities when it comes to fracking. \"The Government has completely failed to win public support for these drilling projects, which is not surprising as they abandoned important environmental safeguards. By seeking to impose fracking, public concern is only likely to deepen.\" Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Hannah Martin said: \"With this move the Government is making a mockery of their commitment to local democracy and giving a slap in the face to the people of Lancashire.\" The same minister who told local councils they should be \"masters of their own destiny' could now overthrow one of the most important and difficult decisions Lancashire councillors have ever made. Share article\" Months of public debate, campaigning, and deliberations could be nullified by a stroke of the minister's pen. Lancashire residents have peacefully and successfully fought to stop fracking before - there are good reasons to believe they will do so again. \"Promoted Stories", "Greg clark": ["Q16194481", "Q16728072", "Q271800", "Q27914893", "Q5605416", "Q5605417", "Q5606856", "Q59165228"]}, {"articleID": "2010083107_00341920_W", "date": "2010-08-31", "url": "http://wtkr.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-us-exotic-pets,0,6773584.story", "content": "nation world fatal bear attack highlights ohio's lax laws on exotic pets and high number of fatal attacks julie carr smyth ap statehouse correspondent columbus, ohio (ap) - the bear that recently killed a caretaker in a cleveland suburb was the latest example of animal violence in a state that has some of the nation's weakest restrictions on exotic pets and among the highest number of injuries and deaths caused by them. after a standoff between the humane society and agriculture interests, state officials are crafting restrictions on the ownership of dangerous wild pets. but the killer beast and others owned by former bear-wrestling entrepreneur sam mazzola, who was on probation at the time of the attack for illegally selling and transporting exotic animals, would have been grandfathered out of them. \"it's just a free-for-all in ohio, and sam mazzola is just an example of that,\" said wayne pacelle, president of the humane society of the united states. \"tigers, wolves, bears in a suburban lorain county community: it is a disaster waiting to happen.\" follow newschannel 3 on twitter the death in ohio and attacks elsewhere - including the maiming of a connecticut woman by her friend's pet chimpanzee and a 2-year-old florida girl squeezed to death by her family's python - highlight that the patchwork of federal, state and local laws on keeping dangerous wild animals at home has holes. mazzola had the proper state permit to keep the black bear, a species native to ohio, on his property. he also kept wolves, tigers and a lion, saomething he was free to do because ohio and at least four other states - alabama, idaho, missouri and montana - impose few or no restrictions on the ownership of non-native animals kept solely as pets, according to a review of state regulations by the associated press. the u.s. department of agriculture regulates animals exhibited to the public but not private ownership. the u.s. fish and wildlife service requires permits for native endangered and threatened species but doesn't track non-native, endangered species unless they cross state borders. the humane society cut a deal this year with ohio gov. ted strickland and leading farm groups that traded pulling an animal cruelty measure off the november ballot for certain animal protections, including a ban on exotic pets. farm groups opposed the ballot measure, which would have imposed treatment and caging requirements on livestock, as threatening to ohio's $93 billion agricultural industry. existing non-native animals, like the ones mazzola continues to keep, may be kept under ohio's proposed regulations, but owners would not be able to breed them or replace them when they die. the ban also would exempt animals in zoos, research centers and existing athletic mascot programs, strickland spokeswoman amanda wurst said. many exotic pet owners in ohio and elsewhere believe big animals - especially predators such as lions, tigers, bears and cougars - are no longer safe in the wild because of habitat loss, public fear and poaching. they view themselves as conservationists. \"of the overall amount of people who actually have snakes as pets, who actually have chimpanzees as pets, these incidents are a very small percentage,\" said cindy huntsman, whose stump hill farm near massillon houses 250 wild animals. according to a database of publicized exotic-pet escapes and attacks since 1990 kept by the animal rights group born free usa, ohio ranks fifth in the number of episodes that hurt or killed a human - 14. the leader, florida, has had 43, followed by texas with 19, new york with 18 and california with 16. alabama ties ohio with 14. the ohio bear attack occurred aug. 19 when caretaker brent kandra, 24, took the animal out of its cage for feeding at mazzola's menagerie. mazzola's federal license to exhibit the bear was revoked after animal rights activists complained about his practice of taking money to let people wrestle ceasar, another bear he owned. but he was still free to keep the animals. most people who work regularly with exotic beasts know and accept the risks, huntsman said, comparing it to being a farmer or working with killer whales at seaworld. mazzola reflected that attitude in comments to reporters the day after the fatal attack, showing off a facial scar he got from an encounter with a bear and saying he had a total of 2,000 stitches from his time working with animals. \"these are the things that happen when you deal and love these type of animals,\" he said. tom burrington, 68, a retiree who lives two doors from mazzola, recalled after the attack that one of the man's bears once rolled over a neighbor, who had to go to the hospital. \"it was a big joke,\" burrington said. \"they said the bear sat on a guy, but it was not funny to the safety forces. there wasn't anything funny about it.\" a federal judge on friday ordered mental health treatment for mazzola as new terms of his probation sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to transporting a bear to toledo and selling a skunk without a license. mazzola's attorney didn't return a message monday seeking comment. animal rights groups have used attacks like the one that killed kandra to push for tougher regulations elsewhere. after a friend's 200-pound pet chimpanzee mauled and blinded a connecticut woman in 2009, state lawmakers voted to ban ownership of large primates and other potentially dangerous animals, such as bears, leopards and wolves. since the florida girl was suffocated by her family's burmese python last year, it has become illegal for individuals there to own them and six other large, exotic reptile species. born free usa considers it inhumane to keep large, wild animals in captivity even if they don't hurt anyone, executive vice president <mark> adam roberts </mark> said. exotic pet ownership also includes the risk of infectious disease, damage to the environment when pets are set free or escape, and a growing financial burden on animal rescue groups that run sanctuaries for animals that are abandoned, he said. the association of zoos & aquariums recommends against exotic pet ownership in part because of the lethal diseases wild animals can carry: distemper and rabies in carnivores; herpes in monkeys; and salmonella in reptiles. vaccines used on domestic animals often don't work on their wild cousins, the group notes. \"people see wild animals and they see them as cute, as something they want to have, want to hold, want to covet,\" <mark> roberts </mark> said. \"then they get bigger and more dangerous and the owner is in over their head.\" ___ associated press writers susan haigh in hartford, conn., bill kaczor in tallahassee, fla., and tom sheeran in cleveland contributed to this report. on aug. 30, 1967, the senate confirmed thurgood marshall as the first black supreme court justice garmin recalls 1.3 million nuvi gps devices because of a battery problem", "Adam roberts": ["Q350734", "Q4679680", "Q4679681", "Q4679686"]}, {"articleID": "2018050314_00136202_W", "date": "2018-05-03", "url": "https://cdn2.benzinga.com/pressreleases/18/05/r11638108/chicken-salad-chick-builds-momentum-in-tennessee-with-opening-of-knoxv", "content": "Chicken Salad Chick Builds Momentum in Tennessee with Opening of Knoxville Location May 03, 2018 10:15 am Comments Share: Chicken Salad Chick Builds Momentum in Tennessee with Opening of Knoxville Location -

The Knoxville restaurant is owned and operated by longtime Chicken Salad Chick fan Josh Patton of Volunteer Restaurant Concepts. The Tennessee native had his first Chicken Salad Chick experience at the original Auburn location back in 2008. A senior in college at that time, Patton was a frequent visitor, sometimes even making two trips to Chicken Salad Chick in one day. His love for chicken salad quickly turned into a desire to open his own location and in 2014, that dream became a reality when he opened his first Chicken Salad Chick in Chattanooga. Since then, he's opened additional locations in Chattanooga and Knoxville, with plans to open another three throughout those markets. \"When I first walked into the original Chicken Salad Chick restaurant 10 years ago, I knew I stumbled into something special,\" said Patton. \"Founder Stacy <mark> Brown </mark> used to joke with me about eating there so often, but I couldn't get enough of the high-quality food and southern charm. My passion for the brand led me to open my own locations and I'm grateful for the opportunity to introduce the concept to residents in Knoxville.\" The Chicken Salad Chick concept, born in Auburn, was established in 2008 in the kitchen of founder, Stacy <mark> Brown </mark>. When Stacy discovered that the local county health department would not allow her to continue making and selling her delicious recipes out of her home kitchen, she overcame that obstacle by launching her first restaurant with the business expertise of her future husband and fellow founder, <mark> Kevin Brown </mark>. Together, they opened a small takeout restaurant, which quickly grew; the company now has 88 restaurants across the Southeast. Chicken Salad Chick in Knoxville will be open Monday--Saturday from 11 a.m.--8 p.m. For more information, visit http: //www.chickensaladchick.com.

Colstrip Bill Allows MT Utility to Skirt Regulation Senate Bill 331 would allow NorthWestern Energy to pass on $75 million to Montana ratepayers if it buys more energy from Colstrip. (Tonyglen14/Flickr) April 2, 2019 HELENA, Mont.--A controversial bill that would allow NorthWestern Energy to sidestep regulations to buy more power from the Colstrip coal plant continues to make its way through the Montana Legislature. Senate Bill 331, now in the house, is touted as a good deal to meet Montanans' energy needs and a way to save jobs at Colstrip. It would allow the state's largest monopoly utility to pass on $75 million to ratepayers over the next decade if it chooses to buy more energy from the coal plant. Travis Kavulla, a former Public Service Commissioner, said NorthWestern isn't obligated to keep the plant open if it buys more energy, meaning the bill doesn't necessarily secure jobs. He also noted the utility already is able to buy an additional share of the power plant. \"Which, I think, necessarily implies that the only reason for this piece of legislation is because NorthWestern wants special protection or favorable regulatory treatment for a business decision that we should expect it to make all on its own as a business,\" Kavulla said. Kavulla believes NorthWestern is outsourcing a business decision to the Montana Legislature. He also said sticking with coal without evaluating the cost of other energy options such as renewables could cost customers even more. <mark> Jason Brown </mark>, attorney with the Montana Consumer Council, noted the bill also exempts NorthWestern from decommissioning and remediation costs for the share of Colstrip it owns and any additional shares it might buy. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality estimates cleanup costs at the power plant could be as much as $700 million dollars. He said there's no guarantee this would be a good deal for Montanans if regulators step aside. \"A good deal can turn into a bad deal if there's a lack of oversight and planning,\" <mark> Brown </mark> said. \"So I think that's kind of the crux of our concern.\" Kavulla said he also worries about the implications of subsidizing a utility company. \"It's generally not been the policy of the United States and certainly not the policy of a red state like Montana to subsidize uneconomic competition,\" Kavulla said. \"And I worry that that is, in essence, what this S.B. 331 could set up.\" Utilities across the country have been stepping away from coal-based power as the cost of clean-energy sources such as wind and solar have decreased.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the caption for release dated February 7, 2019 with the accompanying corrected caption. The release reads: SCIENTISTS AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES INVESTIGATE HOW BLOOD FLOW IN THE BRAIN IS AFFECTED BY AUTISM With autism diagnoses on the rise, science is on the hunt for answers. Each year, one in 59 children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a condition that impacts a child's social, emotional, and behavioral development. The rate of diagnosis has grown, tripling in the last 15 years. While genetic and environmental influences have been implicated as potential causes of ASD, little is known about its neurobiology. Now, researchers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles have brought us one step closer. In a study published recently in the journal Biological Psychiatry, CHLA's Bradley Peterson, MD, uncovers a direct link between altered brain activity and social deficits in ASD. Peterson's group studied 44 individuals with ASD and compared them with 66 typically-developing participants. Groups were matched for age, sex, and IQ. Peterson's team used advanced imaging techniques to acquire two types of information. First, the group used a method called arterial spin labeling, which measures blood flow through the vessels of the brain. Because active parts of the brain need the most oxygen and nutrients, more blood flow to an area signals increased brain activity. Second, the team measured levels of NAA, an amino acid byproduct commonly used as a marker of healthy neurons. \"This is a multimodal imaging data set,\" explains Peterson, Director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at CHLA and Professor of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. \"Each modality gives us a different window into the brain. We are able to look through both windows at once to tell us much more about what's going on in the brains of these individuals.\" Scans revealed a striking pattern in the part of the brain called the white matter. Our brains have about 100 billion cells, which communicate with each other through long, wire-like branches called axons. These axons are coated with myelin, a specialized wrapping--like wire insulation--that helps the messages flow faster from one cell to another. Because myelin appears white, communication pathways between cells are collectively called white matter. Cell bodies, or gray matter, are not coated as extensively in myelin and therefore do not appear white. Studies show that communication between distant brain cells is disrupted in ASD due to fewer long-range connections between cells and thinner myelin. Given these differences in white matter, decreased blood flow and activity in this region would make sense. Yet, Peterson and his team found exactly the opposite. In the study, the researchers found what is called hyperperfusion--increased blood flow, indicating more brain activity--throughout large portions of white matter in participants with ASD. Perhaps even more striking, these activity rates were correlated with ADOS scores; ADOS is a tool used by doctors to help diagnose ASD. If white matter is compromised in ASD, one might expect decreased activity in this region, not increased. Peterson explains that this finding likely reveals an attempt to compensate for underlying white matter problems. \"If the drive train in your car is compromised, you have to hit the gas harder to achieve the same speed,\" he explains. Similarly, supporting cells in the brain that create and maintain the myelin wrapping seem to be working overtime to counteract deficits in the underlying axon. This compensatory mechanism may partially explain why many individuals with ASD are high functioning. \"This correlation of perfusion and ADOS is absolutely key,\" emphasizes Peterson, \"because it shows that the higher the blood flow, the more ASD symptoms the participants have. This very solidly supports the idea of compensation.\" Looking in the second window--measuring NAA concentrations as a marker for healthy neurons--revealed support for this idea of compensation. \"We found that in participants with autism, the lower the NAA concentrations were, the higher their perfusion was at those points in the brain,\" Peterson says. In other words, areas with the lowest levels of healthy neurons were also the ones with the highest activity and blood flow. The majority of autism research has focused on other parts of neurons, as opposed to axons. Peterson's study marks the first to correlate widespread white matter hyperperfusion, healthy neuron biomarkers, and symptom scores. The study paves the way for understanding more about how the brain may compensate for compromised white matter signaling. \"Axons and their supporting cells have not been a major focus in autism research,\" Peterson says. \"My hope is that this study will help to refocus attention on the cell types and brain areas that are critical in understanding the neurological basis for ASD.\" Additional authors on the study include Ariana Zargarian, Jarod B. Peterson, Suzanne Goh, Siddhant Sawardekar, Steven C. R. Williams, David J. Lythgoe, Fernando O. Zelaya, and Ravi Bansal.

The death of <mark> Michael Brown </mark>, 18, stirred a night of unrest in the town of Ferguson, Missouri, where the incident happened. Many of the costs these kinds of cases of alleged police misconduct can have on a community are impossible to quantify - in terms of loss of life, and loss of confidence in civic institutions. \"The greatest cost is loss of faith in the police department, which then cause crime to spiral out of control,\" says Dick Simpson, a professor of political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. But there are also some very specific costs to a community, with dollar amounts attached. For example, a string of notorious police brutality cases in the 1970s, '80s and '90s, connected to one police lieutenant, <mark> John Burge </mark>, cost the city of Chicago more than $100 million, says Simpson. The money went to court fees, lawyer fees, and multi-million dollar payouts to some victims. As Tim Lynch, director of the Cato institute's Project on Criminal Justice, points out, all that money has to come from some place. \"The tax payers of these various cities pay the costs,\" he says. The money usually comes through a city's general fund, says Professor Simpson. Meaning, if a city has to spend a lot on a big police misconduct case, \"it diminishes the ability to provide services to citizens, and it raises their property taxes.\" ", "Michael brown": ["Q10456471", "Q11936682", "Q1328702", "Q15522038", "Q17516932", "Q1779573", "Q18344346", "Q18719315", "Q26915320", "Q27914049", "Q295684", "Q30123102", "Q336303", "Q3857364", "Q458065", "Q47487885", "Q50143349", "Q50978985", "Q55998905", "Q57392216", "Q57413534", "Q6828857", "Q6828858", "Q6828861", "Q6828864", "Q6828865", "Q6828867", "Q6828868", "Q6828870", "Q6828871", "Q786003"], "John burge": ["Q57468255", "Q6223885"]}, {"articleID": "2018121911_00187131_W", "date": "2018-12-19", "url": "http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/northamerica-life-arts/5-body-language-signs-a-breakup-is-looming-according-to-experts/ar-BBR7mJv?li=BBJGCka", "content": "Portals Navigation Outlook.com Skype Microsoft Store Facebook Twitter Office OneDrive Receive your emails here See your recent emails Send a quick email Manage your calendar with easy access Sign in with any Microsoft account: Outlook, Hotmail, MSN, Live What is a Microsoft account?
