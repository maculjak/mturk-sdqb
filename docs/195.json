opening sentence was as simple, declarative and revolutionary as a line out of hemingway: \"okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond,\" chinua achebe wrote in \"things fall apart .\" africans, the nigerian author announced more than 50 years ago, had their own history, their own celebrities and reputations. achebe, the internationally celebrated nigerian author, statesman and dissident, who died at age 82 after a brief illness, continued for decades to rewrite and reclaim the history of his native country. achebe lived through and helped define revolutionary change in nigeria, from independence to dictatorship to the disastrous war between nigeria and the breakaway country of biafra in the late 1960s. he knew both the prestige of serving on government commissions and the fear of being declared an enemy of the state. he spent much of his adult life in the united states, but never stopped calling for democracy in nigeria or resisting literary honors from a government he refused to accept. photos: notable deaths in 2013 / 2012 even in traffic today in lagos, nigeria's largest city, hawkers sell pirated copies of his recent civil war memoir. \"what has consistently escaped most nigerians in this entire travesty is the fact that mediocrity destroys the very fabric of a country as surely as a war - ushering in all sorts of banality, ineptitude, corruption and debauchery,\" wrote achebe, whose death was confirmed friday by his literary agent, <mark>andrew wylie</mark>. his eminence worldwide was rivaled only by gabriel garcia marquez, toni morrison and a handful of others. achebe was a moral and literary model for countless africans and a profound influence on such american writers as ha jin, junot diaz and morrison, who once called achebe's work an \"education\" for her and \"liberating in a way nothing had been before .\" his public life began in his mid-20s. he was a resident of london when he completed his handwritten manuscript for \"things fall apart,\" a short novel about a nigerian tribesman's downfall at the hands of british colonialists. turned down by several publishers, the book was finally accepted by heinemann and released in 1958 with a first printing of 2,000. its initial review in the new york times ran less than 500 words, but the novel soon became among the most important books of the 20th century, a universally acknowledged starting point for postcolonial, indigenous african fiction, the prophetic union of british letters and african oral culture. \"it would be impossible to say how\" things fall apart' influenced african writing, \"the african scholar kwame anthony appiah once observed .\" it would be like asking how shakespeare influenced english writers or pushkin influenced russians. achebe didn't only play the game, he invented it. \"\"things fall apart\" has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide and has been translated into more than 50 languages. achebe also was a forceful critic of western literature about africa, especially joseph conrad's \"heart of darkness,\" standard reading for millions, but in achebe's opinion, a defining example of how even a great western mind could reduce a foreign civilization to barbarism and menace. \"now, i grew up among very eloquent elders. in the village, or even in the church, which my father made sure we attended, there were eloquent speakers. so if you reduce that eloquence which i encountered to eight words & it's going to be very different,\" achebe told the associated press in 2008. \"you know that it's going to be a battle to turn it around, to say to people,\" that's not the way my people respond in this situation, by unintelligible grunts, and so on; they would speak .' and it is that speech that i knew i wanted to be written down. \"his first novel was intended as a trilogy and the author continued its story in\" a man of the people \"and\" arrow of god. \"he also wrote short stories, poems, children's stories and a political satire,\" the anthills of savannah, \"a 1987 release that was the last full-length fiction to come out in his lifetime. achebe, who used a wheelchair in his later years, would cite his physical problems and displacement from home as stifling to his imaginative powers. achebe never did win the nobel prize, which many believed he deserved, but in 2007 he did receive the man booker international prize, a $120,000 honor for lifetime achievement. achebe, paralyzed from the waist down since a 1990 auto accident, lived for years in a cottage built for him on the campus of bard college, a leading liberal arts school north of new york city where he was a faculty member. he joined brown university in 2009 as a professor of languages and literature. achebe, a native of ogidi, nigeria, regarded his life as a bartering between conflicting cultures. he spoke of the\" two types of music \"running through his mind - ibo legends and the prose of dickens. he was also exposed to different faiths. his father worked in a local missionary and was among the first in their village to convert to christianity. in achebe's memoir\" there was a country, \"he wrote that his\" whole artistic career was probably sparked by this tension between the christian religion \"of his parents and the\" retreating, older religion \"of his ancestors. he would observe the conflicts between his father and great uncle and ponder\" the essence, the meaning, the worldview of both religions. \"for much of his life, he had a sense that he was a person of special gifts who was part of an historic generation. achebe was so avid a reader as a young man that his nickname was\" dictionary. \"at government college, umuahia, he read shakespeare, dickens, robert louis stevenson and jonathan swift among others. he placed his name alongside an extraordinary range of alumni - government and artistic leaders from jaja wachukwa, a future ambassador to the united nations; to future nobel laureate <mark>wole soyinka</mark>; achebe's future wife (and mother of their four children) christine okoli; and the poet christopher okigbo, a close friend of achebe's who was killed during the biafra war. after graduating from the university college of ibadan, in 1953, achebe was a radio producer at the nigerian broadcasting corp., then moved to london and worked at the british broadcasting corp. he was writing stories in college and called\" things fall apart \"an act of\" atonement \"for what he says was the abandonment of traditional culture. the book's title was taken from poet <mark>william butler</mark> yeats'\" the second coming, \"which includes the widely quoted line,\" things fall apart; the centre cannot hold. \"his novel was nearly lost before ever seen by the public. when achebe finished his manuscript, he sent it to a london typing service, which misplaced the package and left it lying in an office for months. the proposed book was received coolly by london publishers, who doubted the appeal of fiction from africa. finally, an educational adviser at heinemann who had recently traveled to west africa had a look and declared:\" this is the best novel i have read since the war. \"in mockery of all the western books about africa, achebe ended\" things fall apart \"with a colonial official observing okonkwo's fate and imagining the book he will write:\" the pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower niger. \"achebe's novel was the opening of a long argument on his country's behalf .\" literature is always badly served when an author's artistic insight yields to stereotype and malice, \"achebe said during a 1998 lecture at harvard university that cited joyce cary's\" mister johnson \"as a special offender .\" and it becomes doubly offensive when such a work is arrogantly proffered to you as your story. some people may wonder if, perhaps, we were not too touchy, if we were not oversensitive. we really were not. \"achebe could be just as critical of his own country. the novels\" a man of the people \"and\" no longer at ease \"were stories of corruption and collapse that anticipated the nigerian civil war of 1967-70 and the years of mismanagement that followed. he not only supported biafra's independence, but was a government envoy and a member of a committee that was to write up the new and short-lived country's constitution. he would flee from nigeria and return many times and twice refused the country's second-highest award, the commander of the order of the federal republic, over the lawlessness in his home state of anambra. in 2011, nigeria's presidency said achebe's refusal\" clearly flies in the face of the reality of nigeria's current political situation. \"achebe responded that\" a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. \"\"i had a strong belief that we would outgrow our shortcomings under leaders committed to uniting our diverse peoples,\" achebe warned. besides his own writing, achebe served for years as editor of heinemann's \"african writer series,\" which published works by nadine gordimer, stephen biko and others. he also edited numerous anthologies of african stories, poems and essays. in \"there was a country,\" he considered the role of the modern african writer. \"what i can say is that it was clear to many of us that an indigenous african literary renaissance was overdue,\" he wrote. \"a major objective was to challenge stereotypes, myths, and the image of ourselves and our continent, and to recast them through stories - prose, poetry, essays, and books for our children. that was my overall goal .\" ", "articleID": "2013032216_00039143_W", "names":

career and agency dilemmas in his weekly encore advice column. this week he tackles the subject of age and relevance. hi chris, i have been working in the agency business for more than 20 years. it's not hard to notice that i am one of the older guys in the office - the grey hair tends to give it away. what's the best way to keep current and relevant in this fast changing world? all my career i was the youngest guy in the room. then, overnight, i looked around and was shocked to discover i was the oldest guy in the room. what had i done to survive, to stay one step ahead? what has happened to all the other guys? with pr's storytelling experience and advertising's ability to define brands, the two disciplines are best placed to work together says the hallway's louise pogmore. the lines between the marketing disciplines used to be very clearly defined: if you paid to insert the brand's message, it was advertising. if the message was spread via influencers, it was pr. increasingly the lines are blurring beyond recognition. we know the media landscape has shifted and is increasingly fragmented. as communication specialists, it's our job to ensure we seamlessly connect brands with consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible for our clients. last night's announcement on the departure of dan johns from ikon was up there. one of the architects of one of australia's all-too-rare local media agency success stories, his exit after a decade with the agency is a shock. while johns wasn't there quite from the beginning, he was close to the agency's original dna. last

self-confessed \"reformed pr', andy lark, chief marketing officer of the commonwealth bank, revels in throwing a cat among the pigeons. with almost a hint of glee, lark did precisely this last week,

uncomfortable standing in the same corner as the over-the-top daily telegraph response to <mark>stephen conroy</mark>'s proposals for media regulation. but in truth, i'm a fellow traveller. <mark>conroy</mark>'s proposal to effectively end press self regulation is a bad thing. the risk posed to freedom of the press is relatively small, but it opens the door a crack. and in the last few days, i've found myself thinking about the miserable year i spent editing a magazine in a country that censored the press. it's a disgrace that media agency bosses are all men and their assistants are all women, argues zo boss ian perrin. marissa mayer, the issue of women in leadership has recently received a great deal of global coverage. closer to home, the debate is just as pertinent, with only

awards haul. the importance of awards to the communications industry is evident by the placement of trophies in the offices of agencies across the country. at the headquarters of one sydney organisation, even the wallpaper has pictures of cannes lions on it and you'd be hard pressed to find a desk or shelf that isn't sporting a one show gold pencil - or 10. ralph van dijk, founder of creative sound agency eardrum and winner of multiple awards including sirens, lions and award awards, says: \"awards are important for business and personal reasons. we get work from advertisers, and their agencies, and advertisers are motivated by effectiveness - they know that creative, original thinking in their ads gives them more cut through. our award success gives them confidence in that, but then you've got the agencies and they need awards to improve their profile and get on pitch lists .\" that's clearly the business reason and as for the personal, van dijk says: \"truly creative people aren't usually motivated by money. we prefer acknowledgment and appreciation for the things that we make. if we were motivated by money you'd ask the ecd to scrap the awards budget and just pay us all a christmas bonus but i've never heard a creative team say that .\" <mark>michael ritchie</mark> of production house revolver, whose awards haul includes cannes lions, trophies from the uk's d & ad awards, a clio or two, one show pencils and award awards, agrees that award shows are important for the industry. he says: \"they've become more important than ever because they're an aggregator of the work that we all do. there's so much scope to the different kinds of things that we're doing in the marketing and commercial communications area that award shows have become really useful in actually pulling all that stuff together in one sphere. they really are more useful than they've ever been .\" elsewhere in the business, a film and television industry figure who was involved in this year's australian academy of cinema and television arts awards says: \"in an age where there's so much noise, a respected organisation holding up prime examples of the best of their industry is fantastic .\" perhaps the only people that will tell you awards are not important are those that don't have them. so how can you change that and get some metal on the mantle? be in it to win it obviously, in order to win awards, you need to actually enter your work in the first place. \"the first step is bloody apply for it because in several categories this year, some outstanding contenders didn't even put in a nomination, which makes it very hard for them to win,\" says the aacta awards insider. the next step to maximise your chances of winning involves doing your homework to ensure you're entering the correct category. \"at the aactas this year shaun micallef's mad as hell was nominated in the comedy category while shows like gruen and the chaser's hamster wheel were nominated for light entertainment and that was purely because they decided to enter in those categories. so you end up comparing apples and oranges and in fact you have oranges sitting in two categories that are not allowed to be compared to each other,\" says the industry insider. presentation isn't everything the next step in entering award shows is to select the work you plan to submit, a task made all the more difficult for categories related to television series when entrants are asked to submit just a couple of episodes from the show to people that may or may not have seen the series. \"people trip over themselves to follow the rules on these committees so they won't judge a show based on something they've seen outside of the nominated episodes. choose your best ones but also try to choose episodes that will let someone that hasn't seen your series access it which is a tough thing to bring together. episode one, then your best episode, probably isn't the worst idea in the world,\" says the aacta insider. with your best work selected, it's time to put together your application. while many media and ad agencies have dedicated personnel to take care of such admin, this is less likely in other sectors of the business. isabel wartho, marketing and communications manager for publishers australia, whose annual awards recognise excellence in custom magazine publishing, business to business titles and consumer magazines, says: \"read the rubric of the awards criteria and answer the questions .\" wartho also encourages entrants to put their best foot forward but cautions against going over the top. she says some of the entries they received for their awards in late 2012 were \"over engineered\". \"we did have to give our judges fairly strict instructions before the whole process began. some people tried to submit shareholders reports or fancy presentations that they have done,\" says wartho. her colleague annie wylie adds: \"bells and whistles don't count for a lot. our judges found when people complied 20-page glossy applications, it really didn't affect the way they looked at it .\" a recent bone of contention in the advertising awards process is case study videos. leo burnett melbourne's creative director andrew woodhead recently suggested in an opinion piece for encore that creatives were spending more time and money compiling case study videos than the work itself. eardum's van dijk, who heads to cannes in june to head up the radio jury, says case study videos are also starting to pop up in the radio category. \"it becomes a slightly uneven playing field. you can make a very compelling tv ad promoting a radio ad and suddenly that's been elevated. you go,\" wait a minute we're judging the piece here', \"he says. inside the jury room so you have submitted your entry and the judging process has begun. in order to maximise your chances, it pays to know what juries are looking for. matt buchanan, managing director of pr agency one green bean, was a judge at the cannes lions international festival of creativity in 2012. his criteria for judging was simple. he says:\" insight is one of the big things. a campaign grounded in innovative or interesting insight. the main thing we all talked about at cannes was effectiveness. did the work deliver on the business ambition, the commercial objectives of the client? those are the big things and it goes without saying creativity is at the heart of everything. \"revolver's <mark>ritchie</mark>, who has most recently judged the craft category at the award awards and spikes asia, says commercial objectives are less important for his judging process .\" you've got to look at what the work has done, if it's done something differently, how it has made an idea work more strongly than that idea might have otherwise worked, \"he says. when van dijk briefs his international jury in june to choose the best radio work from around the world, he will be giving them simple guidelines .\" the two-word criteria for me is relevant cleverness. it's something that's surprising, original, but relevant. relevant for the brand, the product, but also the medium. there's lots of original thinking going on, and i judge a lot of awards and hear a lot of original thinking, but unless it's relevant, it's great art but not great advertising, \"he says. that's the intellectualised version of what judges are looking for but there's another element involved entirely? feeling. van dijk says:\" creative people can tell. it's a visceral response. you feel something. you don't just look at the work and go, \"oh yeah, that's pretty good'. it makes you feel something in the back of your neck .\" and bearing in mind that the judging process often has multiple steps? for judges of most categories at the cannes lions there is a round of prejudging where in some cases thousands of pieces of work need to be viewed before arriving in the south of france? the winning work will be seen numerous times by the jury and an effective measure of whether it's a winner is often if it can still elicit that response. criteria aside, <mark>ritchie</mark> says: \"usually the best stuff floats to the surface .\" while there is little an award entrant can do about it, there is also the make up and politics of the jury room to contend with. \"you've got people who are all members of the industry and you end up with a\" horse designed by committee' scenario, \"says our aacta awards insider who believes often the work that wins is the least objectionable to all parties in the room. in the case of international award shows like the cannes lions, there has been talk in previous years of\" block voting' where jurors are pressured to select certain pieces of work in an attempt to elevate a particular agency or agency network. and at the most basic level, there is the challenge of conveying cultural nuances such as humour and local personalities to judges from other countries. perhaps the best way to improve your chances of success is to get yourself inside a jury room. eardrum's van dijk says: \"it takes an awful lot of time and i judge a lot of awards each year but it just informs everything - standards of craft, casting, ideas, what works, what doesn't. what the jury room reacts to and why. it's extremely useful .\" so you've entered your work and it's made its way through the judging process to be shortlisted for an award. you bust out your best suit or pop on a frock and head to the awards. as anyone that has been to an awards show knows, your luck could fall either way. you'll either be heading home empty handed before the ceremony even finishes or celebrating your success into the small hours. but should you be lucky enough to score a win, one green bean's buchanan has some sage advice for the big moment: \"keep your speech short and always thank the client .\" pure blonde blocks \"offensive' comments beneath river of blonde ad on youtube jeep ad

have to be almost over? there are only two episodes left after tonight and there hasn't been a weak one yet. this week's chapter opens with a random new guy getting 311 \"ed for giving a patient a lethal dose of adrenaline. rng, whose name is stewart delany and who is played by ioan gruffudd, does a miserable job of defending himself and gets fired, much to the shock of everyone else in the room, except for maybe park. speaking of park, he's brushing up on his english when wilson walks into his office. park immediately susses out that wilson wants something, which happens to be\" a little insight \"into what he can expect at his upcoming deposition. park tells wilson he should be ashamed for sleeping with another man's wife and ruining his marriage. you have to love park's honesty. the one good thing about this development is that it means we get to see more of jason gray-stanford as hospital counsel <mark>scott henderson</mark>, who's agreed to come to wilson's defense. before much can be said, though, tina interrupts the pending deposition and asks to speak privately to her soon-to-be ex-husband, wanting to know what he's\" looking to prove. \"not that he doesn't have every right in the world to be livid or anything. wake up, woman. meanwhile, dr. delany is made to face the parents of the patient he accidentally killed, with hooten straight-up admitting to the distraught couple that she died because of their incompetence. villanueva might be the giant in the room, but is there anyone scarier in this hospital than hooten? not by a long shot. elsewhere at chelsea general, sydney, villanueva and tierney are having a difference of opinion on their next case, that of a guy who tried to jump to his death, and michelle teams up with park to handle a patient. neither of these things goes well, with villanueva saying he might punch tierney and park declaring his patient braindead. he and michelle have to break the news to the woman's distraught significant other, who asks to say goodbye, and wants to know what will happen to her organs. though she wasn't an organ donor, he thinks she'd be happy if she helped save someone...as long as it's not the guy who tried to commit suicide, which conflicts with their religious beliefs. mark ridgeway's lawyer wants to know the details of tina and wilson's affair, which apparently started\" a little over a year ago, \"according to wilson. asked if it mattered that she was married, he hesitates before answering in the affirmative, and walks out when the lawyer wants to know how many times he slept with tina. <mark>henderson</mark> confronts wilson afterward, saying that the case is very real and that it's going to have a massive price tag attached however the chips fall. frustrated by their inability to secure the transplant they need for their patient, villanueva and sydney are surprised when the jumper indicates that he didn't try to kill himself - he was pushed. this prompts the arrival of the police, as well as fran horowitz. villanueva shocks everyone when he says that the patient's deadbeat father is the one who shoved him off the roof .\" i guess he didn't want to be found, \"the big cat says, adding that dad is in police custody. with <mark>henderson</mark>'s words in his head, wilson reluctantly returns to the table to finish his deposition, with the lawyer wanting to know how exactly he started sleeping with his married colleague. <mark>henderson</mark> cuts off the dialogue after wilson says he could name 20 other relationships or affairs at chelsea general, realizing that the lawyer intends to go after not just the doctor, but the hospital. furthermore, that wrinkle creates a conflict of interest for <mark>henderson</mark>, who advises wilson to find new counsel and settle the case before he gets\" crushed. \"everyone else brings their case in front of hooten, looking for guidance. villanueva asks his teammates if they think they can really save the patient, to which a surprisingly affected tierney replies,\" his father pushed him off a roof, i'm not tossing him under a bus. i will save this kid. \"wow, tierney's actually starting to get likeable, isn't he? michelle talks again with delany, who's leaving portland for los angeles, but wants her to keep in touch. he asks for her to give him a moment, and when she pulls away, we see they've been holding hands, so maybe tina and wilson aren't the only two coworkers personally involved at the hospital. it's no surprise that michelle goes to see tina for guidance, but tina tells her that hooten won't change his mind about dismissing delany. tierney, villanueva and sydney head back to the or and seem to have saved their patient, but before they can celebrate too much, are called to another 311 meeting in which hooten addresses both tina and wilson, quipping,\" what happens in vegas doesn't always stay in vegas, does it? \"if somebody somehow didn't know those two were sleeping together, they do now. hooten moves on to the other three docs, seeming to be complimentary, until he brings up the unflattering comments sydney and tierney first made when they thought their patient was a lost cause, and admonishes villanueva for not chastizing them. he accuses them of not really caring until they knew their case was an attempted homicide rather than an attempted suicide. hooten is, as usual, annoyingly right. villanueva sticks his head into the boss's office later and asks him if he's okay. as for tina and wilson, they're at the dive bar. tina asks wilson if he's okay and tries to take sole responsibility for their affair, but he disagrees with her, pointing out that she had something to lose while he didn't .\" as far as i'm concerned, my behavior was worse than yours here, \"he says .\" there are consequences to things. \"he tells her he wants the thing between them to have meaning, maybe just to ease his guilt, which is the most awkward and unflattering way in the history of ever to ask someone out. she doesn't really answer him, but she doesn't leave, either. speaking of leaving, delany is in the process of doing so, when hooten finds him in the parking garage and tries to reassure him that he's still a good doctor. delany cuts him off and tells him\" it's not just the right call, it's the only one. \"they wish each other well before hooten leaves delany to continue his journey to los angeles. while the emphasis on the show's weakest plotline (the affair between tina and wilson) means that this isn't the best episode of to date, the series still comes up with the compelling intellectual dilemmas that have made it such a pleasure to watch. the script goes out of its way for the audience to feel sympathetic toward axed doctor delany, while at the same time we know he absolutely has to pay the price for a fatal mistake. likewise, hooten is spot on in calling out tierney, sydney and villanueva for their initial reaction to their patient's circumstances, but were we in their position, would we also hesitate to give our best to a cause we honestly believed to be hopeless? you can see these situations both ways, which is what makes the series remarkable. it doesn't tell the audience which side of the argument is right or wrong; rather, it's up to the audience to decide how they feel, and in doing so, question how they might respond. it provokes thought, not just a reaction. hopefully, the personal drama will wrap itself up in time, and the series can continue to tell stories that not only entertain, but challenge us as people, too. monday mornings fans should also be sure to check out keong sim on the big screen in olympus has fallen, in theaters now. you can read the bftv interview with keong about the

the law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of federal benefits that go to married people. justice <mark>anthony kennedy</mark>, often the decisive vote in close cases, joined the four more liberal justices wednesday in raising questions about the provision of the federal defense of marriage act that is being challenged at the supreme court. <mark>kennedy</mark> said the law appears to intrude on the power of states that have chosen to recognize same-sex marriages. other justices said the law creates what justice ruth bader ginsburg called two classes of marriage, full and \"skim-milk marriage .\" <mark>kennedy</mark>'s comment came as other conservative justices on the court seemed skeptical about whether they should even proceed with the case over a challenge to the defense of marriage act. <mark>kennedy</mark> said there was a \"real risk\" that the challenged statute would conflict with state laws, particularly in income tax cases. the federal law affects a range of benefits available to married couples, including tax breaks, survivor benefits and health insurance for spouses of federal employees. it still is possible the court could dismiss the case for procedural reasons, though that prospect seemed less likely than it did in tuesday's argument over gay marriage in california. the motivation behind the 1996 federal law, passed by large majorities in congress and signed by president bill clinton, was questioned repeatedly by justice elena kagan. she read from a house of representatives report explaining that the reason for the law was \"to express moral disapproval of homosexuality .\" the quote produced an audible reaction in the courtroom. <mark>paul clement</mark>, representing the house republican leadership in defending the law, said the more relevant question is whether congress had \"any rational basis for the statute .\" he supplied one, the federal government's interest in treating same-sex couples the same no matter where they live. <mark>clement</mark> said the government does not want military families \"to resist transfer from west point to fort sill because they're going to lose their benefits .\" the u.s. military academy at west point is in new york, where same-sex marriage is legal, and fort sill is in oklahoma, where gay marriages are not legal. a section of the 1996 defense of marriage act says marriage may only be a relationship between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law, regardless of state laws that allow same-sex marriage. lower federal courts have struck down the measure, and now the justices will consider whether to follow suit. a somewhat smaller crowd gathered outside the court wednesday, mainly gay marriage supporters who held american and rainbow flags. one man wore a rainbow flag as a cape. \"two, four, six, eight, we do not discriminate,\" a group chanted at one point. \"if this isn't the time, when is the time? when does equality come into play?\" asked laura scott, 43, of columbia, md. the doma argument follows tuesday's case over california's ban on same-sex marriage, a case in which the justices indicated they might avoid a major national ruling on whether america's gays and lesbians have a right to marry. even without a significant ruling, the court appeared headed for a resolution that would mean the resumption of gay and lesbian weddings in california. marital status is relevant in more than 1,100 federal laws that include estate taxes, social security survivor benefits and health benefits for federal employees. lawsuits around the country have led four federal district courts and two appeals courts to strike down the law's section 3, which defines marriage. in 2011, the obama administration abandoned its defense of the law but continues to enforce it. house republicans are now defending doma in the courts. same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the district of columbia. the states are connecticut, iowa, maine, maryland, massachusetts, new hampshire, new york, vermont and washington. it also was legal in california for less than five months in 2008. the justices chose for their review the case of edith windsor, 83, of new york, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009. windsor, who goes by edie, married thea spyer in 2007 in canada after doctors told them that spyer would not live much longer. she suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years. spyer left everything she had to windsor. there is no dispute that if windsor had been married to a man, her estate tax bill would have been zero. the u.s. 2nd circuit court of appeals in new york agreed with a district judge that the provision of doma deprived windsor of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law. like the proposition 8 case from california, windsor's lawsuit could falter on a legal technicality without a definitive ruling from the high court. the house republicans, the obama administration and a lawyer appointed by the court especially to argue the issue were to spend the first 50 minutes wednesday discussing whether the house republican leadership can defend the law in court because the administration decided not to, and whether the administration forfeited its right to participate in the case because it changed its position and now argues that the provision is unconstitutional. if the supreme court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, windsor probably would still get her refund because she won in the lower courts. but there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books. on tuesday, the justices weighed a fundamental issue: does the constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender? the fact that the question was in front of the supreme court at all was startling, given that no state recognized same-sex unions before 2003 and 40 states still don't allow them. but it was clear from the start of the 80-minute argument in a packed courtroom that the justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, had doubts about whether they should even be hearing the challenge to california's proposition 8, the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban. justice <mark>anthony kennedy</mark>, the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court, suggested the justices could dismiss the case with no ruling at all. such an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in california but would have no impact elsewhere. there was no majority apparent for any particular outcome, and many doubts were expressed by justices about the arguments advanced by lawyers for the opponents of gay marriage in california, by the supporters and by the obama administration, which is in favor of same-sex marriage rights. the administration's entry into the case followed president barack obama's declaration of support for gay marriage. on the one hand, <mark>kennedy</mark> acknowledged that same-sex unions had only become legal recently in some states, a point stressed repeatedly by <mark>charles cooper</mark>, the lawyer for the defenders of proposition 8. <mark>cooper</mark> said the court should uphold the ban as a valid expression of the people's will and let the vigorous political debate over gay marriage continue. but <mark>kennedy</mark> pressed him also to address the interests of the estimated 40,000 children in california who have same-sex parents. \"they want their parents to have full recognition and full status,\" <mark>kennedy</mark> said. \"the voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?\" yet when theodore olson, the lawyer for two same-sex couples, urged the court to support such marriage rights everywhere, <mark>kennedy</mark> feared such a ruling would push the court into \"uncharted waters .\" olson said the court similarly ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down bans on interracial marriage in 16 states. <mark>kennedy</mark> challenged the accuracy of that comment: he noted that other countries had had interracial marriages for hundreds of years. the justice also made clear he did not like the rationale of the federal appeals court that struck down proposition 8, even though it cited earlier opinions in favor of gay rights that <mark>kennedy</mark> had written. that appeals court ruling applied only to california, where same-sex couples briefly had the right to marry before the state's voters in november 2008 adopted proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman.",
