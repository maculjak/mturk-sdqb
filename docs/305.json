Wyden's bid to cut regulations, taxes on craft brewers PORTLAND, Ore. - Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore ., said Friday he has introduced legislation that would promote continued job creation in the growing craft beverage, cider, wine and distillery industries throughout Oregon and the country. The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, S. 1562, introduced Thursday, would cut taxes and modernize outdated regulations for craft brewers, cider makers, vintners, and distillers. Junction City police chief sues city, ex-administrator Most Oregon sex offenders not listed on public website Bundy denies firing gunshots near US researchers in Nevada In Oregon, those industries are responsible for an estimated 40,000 jobs collectively and generate about $6 billion annually in revenue. \"Oregon's craft beer, wine, cider and spirits producers are both world-renowned and a huge boon to our state's economy,\" said Wyden, co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Small Brewers Caucus. \"Each of these industries is unique, and this legislation takes targeted approaches to update antiquated rules and reduce taxes for these growing businesses to ensure that these innovators continue to create high-quality jobs for Oregonians,\" added Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees excise taxes and alcohol regulations. Wyden's legislation builds on a consensus reached among multiple industry groups. And it builds on a number of popular proposals, including the Small BREW Act sponsored by Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md .) and <mark>Susan Collins</mark> (R-Maine); the Fair BEER Act sponsored by Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo .) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc .); the Distillery Excise Tax Reform Act sponsored by Senator <mark>Gary Peters</mark> (D-Mich .); the CIDER Act sponsored by Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.); the AGED Spirits Act sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky .); and the Craft Beverage Bond Simplification Act, which was approved by the Finance Committee earlier this year. In addition, Wyden's legislation includes a variety of new proposals to reduce tax and regulatory burdens for each industry. \"As co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Small Brewers Caucus, Senator Wyden has been a longtime champion for America's craft brewers and we appreciate his strong support,\" said Bob Pease, CEO of the Brewers Association. \"He has been diligently working to reduce federal excise taxes for craft brewers through his co-sponsorship of the Small BREW Act. Now with the introduction of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, Senator Wyden has gone even further to ensure growth for small and independent brewers .\" \"We applaud Senator Wyden for this positive step forward in addressing beer excise tax reform in a fair, equitable and comprehensive way,\" said Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, a national trade association representing brewers, beer importers and industry suppliers. \"The beer-specific provisions of this bill will help brewers and beer importers of all sizes. We look forward to working with the Senator and our industry partners to build support for this important legislation .\" \"Oregon's breweries contribute mightily to our state's economy and Senator Wyden's legislation will allow our small businesses to build on what they've done naturally for decades - create good-paying jobs all across our state,\" said Deschutes Brewery Founder <mark>Gary</mark> Fish, Board Chair of the Brewers Association. \"A fresh approach to eliminating outdated regulations and lowering taxes is a recipe for breweries' uniquely Oregon success story to continue for years to come .\" \"The Oregon Winegrowers Association thanks Senator Wyden for his continuing support and leadership on issues that help improve the competitiveness of Oregon's craft beverage brands,\" said Association Board Director and Treasurer Steve Thomson, Executive Vice President at King Estate Winery. \"Under his proposal, Oregon's midsize and small family wineries would see a significant new tax benefit, enabling them to reinvest in their businesses and further fuel the wine industry's growth and contribution to the Oregon economy. Currently Oregon's 605 wineries, 950 vineyards, and related businesses account for 17,100 jobs, $208 million in tourism, and $3.35 billion in total annual economic impact spread across Oregon's 36 counties .\" \"I am excited to a see very progressive and comprehensive approach to positively change the excise tax for the cider industry, dramatically improve the small producer credit so growth is not taxed excessively and at the same time offer our regulating body, the TTB, more funds to assist our growing industry with compliance,\" said James Kohn, owner of Salem-based Wandering Aengus Ciderworks. \"The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation that tackles some of the most significant barriers that America's distillers currently face, and it provides a measure of excise tax parity that will boost investment and create new jobs in communities across the country,' said Thomas Mooney, President of the American Craft Spirits Association and Co-Owner & CEO of House Spirits Distillery in Portland .\" These issues are important to the rapidly growing number of American craft distillers, and this bill comes only days after the introduction of the bipartisan Distillery Innovation and Excise Tax Reform Act of 2015 (HR 2520) in the House. On behalf of more than 700 distillers across the country, and as an Oregon distiller myself, I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership in taking on these important issues in the Senate. \"In addition to providing tax relief for Oregon's brewers, cider makers, vintners, and distillers, this legislation would also reduce compliance burdens for craft beverage producers by exempting nearly 90 percent of all industry members from complex bonding and bi-weekly tax filing requirements. The bill would exempt aged beers, ciders, wines, and spirits from complicated and burdensome accounting rules. It would reform rules on brewers to encourage more collaboration and streamline regulations. And it would equalize the playing field for all distilled spirits producers. Finally, this bill would cut administrative backlogs by ensuring the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is charged with regulating these industries, is sufficiently funded. Additional enforcement funding and authority would help offset the cost of this bill by cracking down on tax cheats. Copyright 2015 KTVZ. All rights reserved.

And the crowded GOP field now includes 11 candidates, while Democrats have four hopefuls in the race. For Republicans especially, the pressure is on to make the most of their nascent campaigns to make it into the first presidential debate, which is a mere 52 days away on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. \"Everyone's starting their engines and deciding they're going to have to make this push now,\" said national GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. There has been little drama this cycle with the will-they-or-won \"t-they game. Virtually everyone who has been toying with a White House run has pulled the trigger. Only Govs. <mark>Scott Walker</mark>, Wisconsin; Chris Christie, New Jersey; Bobby Jindal, Louisiana; and John Kasich, Ohio, are left. <mark>Walker</mark> is reportedly eyeing an official announcement the second week of July, after his state's budget deadline, while Jindal is set to announce next June 24. Christie continues to give signs that he is getting in, while Kasich has started to build a team in the early states and hired top-name consultants. Some of the candidates who got in early have all gotten bounces. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who announced nearly three months ago, saw his stock rise, especially in Iowa, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saw a marked uptick in early states and nationally. Meanwhile, despite good reviews, other candidates - including former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Gov. Rick Perry - are still lagging in the polls and face the real threat of being left off the first debate stage. Fox News has decided they are limiting the event to the top 10 candidates in an average of the most recent national polls, though last week they bowed to pressure and will host a forum earlier that day for candidates who don't make the cut. Monday, all eyes were on Bush, as he officially launched his presidential campaign. Though he was one of the first to confirm in December he was\" actively exploring \"a bid - and he has so many establishment advantages of money and organization - his unofficial campaigning over the past few months has been unable to put any space between him and the rest of the field. He hopes his official campaign announcement can be something of a reset .\" I will take nothing and no one for granted, \"he said Monday in Miami at his kickoff .\" I will run with heart. I will run to win. \"While the past two nominating cycles have seen the GOP establishment favorite eventually take the nomination, strategists warn that this cycle there's now no clear front-runner .\" He's the one with the hardest task, \"said Ford O'Connell, who worked for the Arizona senator's 2008 campaign .\" Unlike previous establishment folks like [John] McCain and [Mitt] Romney, the one thing he faces they didn't is a very challenging field. \"After missteps and concern from conservatives over his positions on immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, Bush is near the top of the pack Iowa. Another big question will be answered on Tuesday - what will <mark>Donald Trump</mark> do? After flirting with presidential runs for years - and trying to psych out the press - the reality TV star and business mogul keeps talking like he's really taking the plunge this year. If that does happen, he could push other candidates off the debate stage, too, since he's currently polling ninth nationally. The field could see another aftershock if Kasich does jump in. But the Ohio governor could face the curse of other candidates who have waited too long to officially announce - Perry waited until August 2011 last time and never gained traction, while in 2008, then-Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson's long-awaited candidacy flopped .\" A lot of people don't understand that running for president looks real easy from the cheap seats but it's a lot different from the ground, \"said O'Connell.", "articleID": "2015061721_00011898_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Scott Walker": ["Q13502385", "Q2035840", "Q20712628", "Q28835721", "Q48799183", "Q488603", "Q553254", "Q55362601", "Q7437461"]}}, {"date": "2015-06-25", "url": "http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=329810", "content": "Tuesday, June 23, 2015 10:36:47 AM (IST) Sr Nirmala Joshi, successor of Mother Teresa passes away Kolkata, Jun 23 (IANS): Sister Nirmala, who succeeded Mother Teresa as superior general of the Missionaries of Charity, died here on Tuesday. She was 81. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said her life was devoted to \"caring for the poor and underprivileged\". Nirmala became the second head of the Missionaries of Charity after its founder Mother Teresa stepped down from the post in March 1997. The Nobel laureate died on September 5 the same year. Nirmala held the post till March 24, 2009, when she was succeeded by Sister Mary Prema. Archbishop of Kolkata <mark>Thomas D'Souza</mark> told IANS that the funeral mass will be held at the Mother House on Wednesday at 4 p.m. Sister Nirmala will be laid to rest at the St. John's cemetery. Born Nirmala Joshi in Ranchi to a Brahmin family from Nepal in 1934, she joined the MoC after converting from Hinduism in het youth. An MA in political science and a trained lawyer, Sister Nirmala started the MoC's contemplative branch in 1976 and headed it till 1997 when she was elected to succeed Mother Teresa as the order's Superior General. She was elected for a second term in 2003. Sister Nirmala was re-elected for a third term on March 13, 2009, but the MoC held a second election days later after she wanted to be relieved of the responsibility owing to ill-health and also expressed a desire to return to the contemplative life she led before heading the order. Sister Nirmala was honoured with India's second highest civilian order Padma Vibhushan in 2009 for her services to the nation. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condoled Sister Nirmala's death and tweeted: \"Saddened at the passing of Sister Nirmala who headed Missionaries of Charity after Mother Teresa. Kolkata and the world will miss her .\" Banerjee paid her last respects to Sister Nirmala at St John's Church here. Describing it as a personal loss, she said the state government will extend all help and cooperation for the last rites. International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) also extended its condolences. \"Her life of dedication and service especially to the poor is a great inspiration and it is to be pondered upon and to be followed,\" ISKCON's spokesperson Radharaman Das said. Stay updated wherever you go with Daijiworld.com and Daijiworld 24X7 tv channel mobile apps. My association with Sr.. Nirmala was in 1957 when she was a Hindu. Her name then was Kusum Joshi. She was doing her post graduation and we six of us Mangalorean teachers, working at Patna Womens College. She stayed with us along with her two sisters, Rabha and Bindu. She was also N.C.C. captain. A very jovial, smart and active person. Though she was a Hindu, she attended daily mass regularly. She was an inspiration to us catholics. After many years I met her in Mangalore as Sr.. Nirmala. I was extremely excited to see her. She told me then, that her sister Radha expired some years back and Bindu ian A.C. nun in one of the convents in the north. <mark>William Joseph</mark> & Milliana Concessao, Mangalore, Muscat.

As she continued the legacy of Mother Teresa, hope somebody will take over the legacy from Sr.. Nirmala. Santan Mascarenhas, Kinnigoli/Mumbai RIP Sister Nirmala. Big thanks to you for the dedication of your entire life for the poor, sick, lepers, destitute and dying. Govt of India gave you Padma Vibushan for your dedicated service. Her father, who was an Army Officer in British Army till 1947, came to her convent with a gun to take back her. But, after sensing her determination and meeting Mother Theresa, we went back. I think her younger sister is also a sister in M.C. Tuesday, June 23, 2015 A very big thank you from the bottom of our hearts for dedicating your life to God in the service of the \"poorest of the poor' and the down trodden in the footsteps of our most Blessed Mother Teresa - a Saint to us.

Communicating with the business now more than ever requires communicating with these users, and effective communication requires a clear understanding of their experience with the application services you deliver. But how well do you understand end-user experience? To answer that question, let's first define end-user experience as the transaction response time a user receives from an application service; click to glass seems to be the term in vogue. Alternatively, you can look at the question from a different perspective: How is the quality of your application services measured? Are you driven primarily by infrastructure and application performance metrics, or by end-user experience? Whether your data center supports customer-facing applications that directly generate revenue or enterprise applications that automate and manage critical business processes - or, increasingly, both - application performance matters. It is the way your service quality is perceived by your users - consumers or employees. Business owners understand this intrinsically; poor ecommerce site performance results in lost revenue and damaged loyalty, while internally, poor application performance leads to decreased productivity and lost business opportunities. APM's Three Aspects Application performance monitoring can be segmented into three aspects, or disciplines: Device monitoring provides critical visibility into the health of the infrastructure components - the servers, disks, switches, routers, firewalls, desktops, etc. required to deliver application services. Application monitoring provides visibility into critical application components, such as application containers, methods, databases, APIs, etc.. End-user experience monitoring, within its performance context, provides visibility into user productivity, and provides a top-down business-centric perspective of both device and application performance. It's clear that the first two aspects - device and application monitoring - are fundamentally important. We should also be able to agree that, to answer our earlier question about service quality, you must also measure the end-user's experience. When users complain, they speak in terms of transaction speed, not network latency, interface utilization, database queries, java server pages, or CPU speed. (Well, if you're on the network team, you'll claim they often will say the network is slow, but we generally know better .) The user's experience can be considered the intersection between business metrics (productivity) and IT metrics (device and application); it's the one metric both groups have in common. Most of us are pretty good at device and application monitoring; this is often not the case when we consider end-user experience monitoring. So what are the penalties if you're not measuring end-user experience?' You won't know users are having a problem until they call you (unless something catastrophic happens). You will chase after problems that don't affect users (because you're monitoring dozens, or hundreds, of metrics of varying impact). You won't have a description of the problem that matches your metrics (and therefore don't have a validated starting point for troubleshooting). You won't know when or if you've resolved the problem (without asking the users). At Cisco Live this week, an IT manager told me of his frustration with all-too-frequent 3 a.m. infrastructure or application alerts: should he get up and investigate? He had no idea if the problem of the moment had any impact on users. Only by adopting end-user experience monitoring was he able to qualify and prioritize his response. Don't We Already Measure End-User Experience? It's true that many applications - particularly those based on Java and. NET platforms - may already be instrumented with APM agents, some of which provide exactly this insight into end-user experience. However: These APM solutions are often not used by operations teams Not all Java and. NET apps will be instrumented (and if you're not using Dynatrace, you might only be sampling transactions) Many application architectures don't lend themselves to agent-based instrumentation IT operations teams therefore usually rely on more traditional infrastructure-centric device and network monitoring solutions. The rise of application-awareness (primarily in Application Aware Network Performance Monitoring - AA NPM - solutions, but also in device management offerings) has given IT varying degrees of insight into application behavior - and sometimes a degree of insight into application performance. However, without visibility into end-user experience, without a user transaction-centric starting point, these tools do little to foster the communication and collaboration we mentioned earlier. As I pointed out in a recent webcast called the Top Five Benefits of Transaction-Centric NPM, AA NPM solutions are generally quite limited in their ability to measure actual end-user experience, especially across a broad range of application architectures. Instead, these tools use key infrastructure measurements such as network latency, packet loss, jitter, etc., as indicators or hints of application performance as experienced by end users. These metrics may be quite meaningful to IT specialists, but they aren't end-user experience and don't provide a basis for effective communication.

Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps Join Us at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, California, November 3-5 Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS - software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service. Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year. Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous. Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud. Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: \u2022 Cloud Computing \u2022 Big Data | Analytics \u2022 Internet of Things \u2022 Containers | Microservices \u2022 WebRTC \u2022 DevOps Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100 + exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. Save $300 on your \"Golden Pass\" !

June 26 (Warner Bros. / MGM) Cast Josh Wiggins, Lauren Graham, Thomas Yakin After his Marine partner is killed in action, a military working dog is adopted by the soldier's Texas family. The handsome Belgian Malinois who plays the title character in Max (with the help of a few trusty stunt doubles) is an action star par excellence. He's also the only involving character in this blunt instrument of a family drama. The canine trouper fares best not just because of that expressive face and athletic body, but because he's spared the embarrassment of speaking the hokey dialogue. Emotional nuance never has been the forte of director Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans) or his co-scripter, Sheldon Lettich (Rambo III), but here even the broad-stroke storytelling falls short of its intended impact - not helped by the desperate bombast of Trevor Rabin's score. The tale of a war-traumatized military working dog, or MWD, who helps a teen boy and his family overcome their own war-related grief, Max puts a YA slant on an intriguing setup. But the screenplay muddles its emotional core with a clunky cross between old-fashioned Hardy Boys mystery and a far-fetched weapons-trafficking subplot. Families who have already seen Inside Out might be enticed, along with moviegoers who are eager to root for a heroic hound and are not put off by the military angle. Though the movie's good guys and bad guys couldn't be more clearly drawn, that military angle is far from flag-wavingly simplistic (though not exactly complex), with Yakin and Lettich foregrounding PTSD and other devastating effects of frontline battle. Max's post-traumatic stress makes him unable to work with anyone else after his Marine handler, Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell), is killed in Afghanistan. The sight of Max running to Kyle's coffin is wrenching. Summer Movie Guide: Sequels...Comedy...Action! Soon after the funeral, the Wincotts are alerted that Max will be put down, so they decide to adopt him. The decision is spearheaded by mom Pamela (Lauren Graham, lending leavening warmth), who declares, in one of the film's more effective lines, that \"this family takes care of its own .\" Dad Ray, an injured Iraq vet played with overdone rigidity by Thomas Haden Church, comes to blame the dog for his son's death, upping the friction between him and his younger son, Justin (Josh Wiggins of Hellion), who becomes Max's caretaker. With training tips from tough-talking tomboy Carmen (Mia Xitlali) that are drawn straight from the Cesar Millan playbook, Justin puts aside his video-game bootlegging enterprise and learns to handle Max and understand him. He discovers, too, that the dog growls around Kyle's friend and fellow Marine Tyler (Luke Kleintank) for a reason. Having telegraphed Tyler's bad-apple status from the get-go, Yakin draws a widening circle of hard-to-buy connections involving the discharged Marine, local gang leader Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria), a crooked cop (Owen Harn), a Mexican cartel and, farther afield, the Taliban. The baddies naturally include a couple of Rottweilers, and there's some impressive dog-on-dog action as Max assists de-facto detectives Justin, Carmen and her cousin Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) - without having to partake in their \"comic\" exchanges. Animal coordinator Mark Forbes has drawn commendable performances from the dogs, and the stunt sequences, both canine and human, are staged effectively and are shot well by Stefan Czapsky. But they never really matter. And the teens' hangout, a DIY bike park in the woods that's a nice element of Kalina Ivanov's production design, isn't quite enough to explain Justin's daring two-wheeled maneuvers. Though the lead performance would do Lassie and Rin Tin Tin proud, Max's increasingly ludicrous, cliche-packed plot generates not an ounce of suspense.
