from mexican jail family, politicians win fight for hammar to come home a marine veteran jailed for months in mexico after trying to carry a family heirloom shotgun across the border has been freed, u.s. officials, his lawyer and family said late friday. shortly after 9:30 p.m., hammar's mother, olivia, received a personal email from a u.s. official who reported that he has crossed the border and was in the united states. \"jon is in u.s. territory. god bless america,\" olivia said through tears. the hammar family said they are unsure about their travel plans. because of hammar's post-traumatic stress disorder, the family will not release the details of their flight home. they are currently in texas and are not sure if they will return to south florida friday night. \"i'm going to be cooking all weekend for him. everything he's ever enjoyed eating i will be cooking this weekend,\" said olivia. \"we're just grateful people. this christmas--we'll never forget it .\" the attorney for 27-year-old jon hammar tweeted friday night that his client had been released from a detention center in matamoros, mexico. patrick ventrell, the acting deputy spokesman for the state department, confirmed hammer's release and return to the u.s. in a statement friday night. \"officials from the u.s. consulate general in matamoros met him at the prison and escorted him to the u.s. border, where he was reunited with members of his family,\" the statement said. \"we sincerely appreciate the efforts on the part of mexican authorities to ensure that an appropriate resolution was made in accordance with mexican law, and that mr. hammar will be free to spend the holidays with his loved ones .\" an aide to a legal representative of the mexican attorney general's office had told u.s. sen. <mark>bill nelson</mark>'s staff about the pending release after the florida democrat's office got word from hammar's mother, according to a press release from <mark>nelson</mark>'s office. \"no american should be in a mexican jail for five months without being able to have his case in front of a judge,\" <mark>nelson</mark> said in that statement. \"we're grateful; this is a good christmas present .\" earlier friday, varon levy said he was flying from mexico city to matamoros to pick up his client. after that, the attorney said, they intended to cross the border at brownsville, texas. \"i'm very happy. i feel that the mexican legal system came out the way it should have,\" he said. u.s. immigration and state department officials had been at the mexican detention center waiting for hammar's release. a defense lawyer said mexican authorities determined there was no intent to commit a crime, <mark>nelson</mark>'s office said. the senator was among a handful of elected officials who urged the state department to help get hammar out of mexico. his family had said he was being held in isolation after threats to his safety were received. \"these past few months have been an absolute nightmare for jon and his family, and i am so relieved that this whole ordeal will soon be over,\" said u.s. rep. ileana ros-lehtinen, r-fla., in a statement. \"i am overcome with joy knowing that jon will be spending christmas with his parents, family and friends .\" the attorney, varon levy, said the path for hammar's return was cleared when mexican officials decided not to appeal the judge's ruling. civilian gun ownership is illegal under mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special shop run by the country's department of defense. \"the department of state warns all u.s. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into mexico,\" the u.s. embassy in mexico writes on its website. \"entering mexico with a firearm, certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into mexico unintentionally .\" mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. the family said hammar's shotgun has a barrel of 24 inches. tourists are allowed to bring guns for hunting on rare occasions, but mexican officials said all visitors must receive a special permit before entering the country. mexican customs agents do not issue gun permits. as a result, anyone crossing the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued government permit is in instant violation of mexican law, which stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws. hammar and his friend were on their way to costa rica in august and planned to drive across the mexican border near matamoros in a winnebago filled with surfboards and camping gear. hammar asked u.s. border agents what to do with the unloaded shotgun. his family said agents told them to fill out a form for the gun, which belonged to hammar's great-grandfather. but when the pair crossed the border and handed the paperwork to mexican officials, they impounded the rv and jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun before hammar's release, varon levy said he was not sure of his client's immediate plans upon being freed. \"probably some down time,\" he said. copyright 2012 by

a commission, headed by retired justice usha mehra, will probe the delhi gang-rape case and submit its report in three months. \"the commission headed by former high court judge usha mehra will identify the lapses and may also come up with an interim report if necessary,\" chidambaram told mediapersons here. chidambaram said that the commission would fix responsibility in the case and look into any negligence on part of the delhi police. \"the commission has been also tasked to suggest measures on security and safety of women in the country, especially in the delhi-ncr region,\" said chidambaram. \"whatever we are doing now is only intended to demonstrate the government's serious intent in the matter-that we will apprehend and punish the perpetrators. we will try and find out what

india, chidambaram said: \"we are serious about finding lasting solutions to women's safety issue .\" chidambaram expressed sympathy with the gang-rape survivor's family on the centre's behalf. \"our

warning. \"you're not going to believe this one,\" the jets coach declared without any hint of a smile. in what has been a bizarre season, the jets' wacky quarterback situation took yet another twist. greg mcelroy has a concussion - which he didn't reveal until thursday - and will be replaced by <mark>mark sanchez</mark> as the starting quarterback in the season finale at buffalo on sunday. \"we've come to find out that greg wasn't exactly truthful with our training staff after the game,\" said ryan, who acknowledged he was \"stunned\" to hear the news. \"he never disclosed that he had symptoms after the game to our trainers. right now, he's being evaluated for a concussion .\" mcelroy, preparing to make his second nfl start in place of the benched <mark>sanchez</mark>, was lifting weights thursday morning and started experiencing headaches, ryan said. mcelroy went to the team's training staff and then revealed he was suffering concussion-like symptoms after being sacked 11 times in the jets' 27-17 loss to san diego last sunday. mcelroy and head trainer john mellody then went to ryan to tell the coach the news. offensive coordinator tony sparano said he was \"pretty silent\" when he found out a few minutes after ryan. \"it's another bump in the road here,\" sparano said, \"and it's something we've become a little accustomed to dealing with .\" ryan was not certain exactly when mcelroy suffered the concussion, but said there was no way he would play mcelroy against the bills and the third-stringer will \"definitely be out .\" mcelroy had been listed on the injury report wednesday with a mild abdominal strain, but was a full participant in practice and was expected to play without any issues. \"i admire his courage and everything else, but you have to be truthful and i think that's the lesson learned here with the medical staff,\" said ryan, who spoke to the entire team about concussions after practice. \"the fact he really wanted to play, i understand the competitive side of greg and all that, but the most important thing is the health of the players .\" obviously, i feel fortunate that something like this showed up without him going out there and putting himself in harm's way. \"while <mark>sanchez</mark> wouldn't comment on whether players choosing to play through head injuries is common in the nfl, tebow acknowledged that it probably does happen around the league because of job security .\" you fight hard to earn something and you don't want to jeopardize that with an injury, for sure, \"said tebow, who added that he has never been in mcelroy's situation .\" i think that's definitely something guys will think about. \"ryan chose to start <mark>sanchez</mark> over tim tebow because the team has just two practices and a walkthrough to prepare before the game. he also cited <mark>sanchez</mark>'s success against the bills in the season opener, when he threw three touchdown passes in the jets' 48-28 win. <mark>sanchez</mark> appeared to be on his way to a solid season, but it ended up being his best game. he was benched for the first time in his four-year career after turning over the ball five times at tennessee on dec. 17 .\" i'm excited to play, obviously, \"<mark>sanchez</mark> said .\" you just never want to see something like that happen to a teammate, somebody i really respect. you feel for greg and i'll be ready to play. \"<mark>sanchez</mark> was a bit surprised when ryan told him he'd be starting because he thought mcelroy just wasn't feeling well .\" i guess i didn't expect it, \"<mark>sanchez</mark> said .\" i wasn't coming into today thinking he had a concussion. i never would've known. \"mcelroy leapfrogged tebow on the depth chart to start against the chargers. after finding out about mcelroy's condition, ryan spoke with both <mark>sanchez</mark> and tebow to tell them of his decision .\" obviously, tim's not happy with that, as you'd expect, \"ryan said. the news came on the heels of some tension between ryan and tebow last week, when the popular backup quarterback told the coach he was\" disappointed \"at not getting the start and wanted to play\" regular quarterback. \"espn new york first reported sunday that tebow asked out of the wildcat, and a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed that to the associated press. the two met again last friday to clear the air, and tebow reiterated that he was willing to do anything the team asked him to do. tebow insisted wednesday that he did not refuse to do anything and acknowledged that ryan might have misinterpreted what he said. ryan said he understands that tebow is frustrated at the situation and by not starting, but again would not disclose anything said between the two in their conversations last week. tebow said he didn't think ryan's choice to play <mark>sanchez</mark> was in any way punitive, and added that he and the coach have a\" great \"relationship .\" when you're a competitor, you want to play, \"tebow said .\" but i understood his decision and i just let him know, just like always, that i'll do whatever i can to help the team. \"tebow will be the no. 2 quarterback on sunday at buffalo, and could play - but it won't be as the starter .\" obviously, he'd like a shot at it, \"ryan said,\" but with the situation the way it is, it's a short window, really, to get the preparation time in and i just think it's best for our football team. \"with the way the season has played out, from the quarterback controversies to the injuries suffered by key players, ryan was asked if this is the strangest year he has ever experienced in the nfl. concussion will sideline mcelroy; <mark>sanchez</mark> to start rex ryan stepped to the podium, looked out at the cameras and opened his news

more than 600 games as one of the most accomplished assistant coaches the league has ever seen. when westhoff walks off the field sunday at buffalo, where the jets' 2012 season will come to its merciful end, it will mark his last game as the jets special teams coordinator, a post he held for the last 12 years. it will be highly bittersweet considering the uncharacteristic calamity that has marred this season under westhoff's watch. there have been blocked punts returned for touchdowns, blocked field goals, punts and kickoffs returned for touchdowns and onsides kicks and fake punts successfully executed against the jets. end of an era: though his special teams struggled this season, mike westhoff's unit had a lot of strong seasons during his 12-season jets tenure. these are the game-changing plays westhoff's special teams units are usually inflicting on opponents .\" when you look back at his body of work it's so strong that i don't think his work can be defined by one year, \"cornerback <mark>kyle wilson</mark> said .\" mike has always been one of the top special teams coaches in the league and for this to be his last year is probably tough - to cap off his last year like this is probably frustrating, \"safety <mark>eric smith</mark> said .\" if he retires, it'll be strange not having him coming up to the huddle and in the meetings. \"westhoff, a 64-year-old bone-cancer survivor, does not completely rule out coaching again, but he said,\" i don't believe i want to do that right now. \"\"it's time for me to go,\" westhoff said yesterday. \"sometimes there is a shelf life and it is time for a change. i've been here 12 years. this is my 624th game and i'm proud of that. very few of us get to leave the game of our own volition .\" i share responsibility for what has gone on this year. i accept responsibility and accountability for this [season]. blame? that's semantics and will be decided by others at a later time. \"westhoff said his goal is to get into television, perhaps carving a niche as an analyst to explain the ins and outs of special teams. his son, john, an attorney in indianapolis, will be on the jets sideline with him during the game sunday, something he said\" will be a very special time for us. \"westhoff's players hope to send him off with a performance for him to remember sunday. it won't erase the pain and disappointment this season has brought him. but it would be a nice parting gift .\" we would like to send him off on a high note, \"linebacker nick bellore said .\" i want to send him off with a bang, \"running back <mark>joe mcknight</mark> said .\" that's going to be my mission. \"<mark>mcknight</mark> is a classic example of the many players whose careers westhoff has saved .\" coach westhoff has meant a lot to me, because when i wasn't doing well and not getting in on offense he was chewing me out letting me know he needs me on special teams, and if i was going to make it on this team i was going to have to play special teams, \"<mark>mcknight</mark> said .\" he just kept sticking with me. i appreciate the fact that he believed in me when nobody else did. \"that kind of coaching, more than any perfectly schemed blocked punts or kickoff returns for touchdowns, best defines westhoff's greatness .\" one of the best special teams coaches ever to coach this game, \"former jets and current
