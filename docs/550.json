Question of the Day By The Associated Press - Associated Press - Monday, August 19, 2019 GOLF MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) - Staked to a six-shot lead, <mark>Justin Thomas</mark> spent more time Sunday worrying about what could go wrong than ending 12 months without winning. And right when it started to go wrong, <mark>Thomas</mark> delivered his biggest shots in the BMW Championship. In a span of three holes around the turn at Medinah, his six-shot lead shrunk to two. <mark>Thomas</mark> answered with two clutch wedge shots, two big putts and sailed to a 4-under 68 to secure a three-shot victory over Patrick Cantlay, who gave him a battle to the end with a 65 .\" Patrick played unbelievably, put a lot of heat on me, \"<mark>Thomas</mark> said .\" In the end, it could have been good for me. It kept me focused, kept my head down ....I was really nervous going into today. I remembered that it's really hard to win a golf tournament, and I'm glad that I was able to do so. \"The timing was ideal. His first victory since the World Golf Championship at Firestone last year moved him to the top of the FedEx Cup going into the Tour Championship, where he will start the tournament at 10-under par with a two-shot lead under the new scoring format as the final 30 players chase a $15 million first prize .\" I can certainly say I never slept on a Wednesday lead, \"<mark>Thomas</mark> said. Cantlay, who made four straight birdies around the turn, secured the No. 2 position and will start at 8 under. Brooks Koepka will be 7 under, a staggered start all the way down to even par for the final five players. TENNIS MASON, Ohio (AP) - Two unexpected champions embraced their first Rookwood championship trophies, concluding a week that brought more questions than clarity to the upcoming U.S. Open. Who's going to be healthy on the women's side? Will stumbles in the men's bracket at the Western & Southern Open carry over to New York? And are Madison Keys and Daniil Medvedev capable of carrying their newfound momentum into a Grand Slam event? After winning the biggest tournament title of their careers, they were already getting asked about how it might transfer to the bigger stage. Keys rallied late in both sets and beat <mark>Svetlana Kuznetsova</mark> 7-5, 7-6 (5) for her second title of the season and easily the biggest of her career. After flameouts in her last three tournaments and a tough draw for the week, she couldn't imagine the outcome. Back on the court to receive the trophy, she told the crowd:\" If you told me this is where I would be a week ago, I would have laughed in your face! \"Medvedev beat David Goffin 7-6 (3), 6-4 for his first Masters 1000 title. It was his third straight final, but the first time he had won. Medvedev lost to Rafael Nadal on Montreal a week earlier, then went on to reach his sixth final of this season, most on the ATP tour. He's won twice .\" To finally lift the trophy this week is an amazing feeling, \"Medvedev said. NFL EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Le\u2019Veon Bell will have to wait a little longer for his debut with the New York Jets. Coach Adam Gase announced that the star running back will be held out of the team's final two preseason games .\" I was about 99% sure heading into the preseason, \"Gase said after the Jets' practice at MetLife Stadium .\" It was all based off of how he practiced, conditioning and all those types of things. \"Gase and Bell spoke about the plan when training camp started, and Bell's snaps increased in practice last week. Bell has looked good in training camp after sitting out all last season in a contract dispute with Pittsburgh. Gase and the Jets don't want to take any unnecessary risks with Bell .\" We'll just get him as game ready as possible, \"Gase said .\" He's not really going to know until we get into a real game, but I feel like he's in great shape and he's been contacting about as good as anybody on the practice field. \"So, I feel confident he'll be ready to go (in) Week 1 .\" That would be the regular-season opener against Buffalo on Sept. 8. It will mark the first time Bell will play in a game since the Steelers' playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 14, 2018 - a span of nearly 20 months. \"I'll see y' all in September,\" Bell wrote on Twitter about an hour after Gase's announcement. AUTO RACING LONG POND, Pa. (AP) - The black clouds that enveloped Pocono and officially brought the IndyCar race to a premature end didn't appear until the halfway point. But they've really been hanging over the track since the series returned to the mountains in 2013. A fatal crash. A promising career wrecked by paralysis. And again Sunday, a first-lap demolition derby that sent another driver to the hospital and stirred an angry mob howling for IndyCar to get the heck out of town once and for all. It may be a moot point, IndyCar and Pocono don't have a deal for a 2020 race. But for <mark>Robert Wickens</mark>, the Canadian confined to a wheelchair after last year's accident, IndyCar has no place on the 2 1/2 - mile superspeedway. \"How many times do we have to go through the same situation before we can all accept that an IndyCar should not race at Pocono,\" he tweeted. The counter argument was posed from the Australian snapping victory lane photos inside a cramped Pocono media center as rain pounded the track outside. Will Power was in the right position Sunday to claim the win when lightning struck in the area to not only win the race, he ended the potential for his first winless season since 2006 and he took the checkered flag at Pocono for the third time in four years. \"I really hope we come back, I do,\" Power said. \"It's hard for us to find good ovals that suit our cars .\" IndyCar at Pocono has turned into perhaps the scariest race day in auto racing, 500 miles of danger for drivers on the 2 1/2 - mile track and white knuckles and clasped hands for anyone watching the event. The green flag had barely been dropped when 2017 Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato used an aggressive - arguably foolish - move to trigger a wreck that sent Felix Rosenqvist to the hospital. Sato tried to shoot a gap on the first lap, cut off Alexander Rossi and connected with Ryan Hunter-Reay in a crash that left cars and debris strewn across the track. Sato's car landed upside down on Hunter-Reay's Honda. \"I can't even begin to understand how after last year Takuma thinks that's acceptable,\" Rossi said. \"It's disgraceful .\" Rosenqvist hit the fence nose first and his car slammed back on the track. Rosenqvist did not suffer life-threatening injuries and was cleared. \"Definitely feel lucky escaping without any serious injuries after visiting the catch fence there,\" he tweeted. ___", "articleID": "2019081908_00193726_W", "names": {"Justin Thomas": ["Q15877245", "Q19666564", "Q22098319", "Q51084062", "Q52504008", "Q775036"], "Robert Wickens": ["Q113936", "Q39385430"], "Svetlana Kuznetsova": ["Q192064", "Q21063641", "Q3978501", "Q4245117"]}}, {"date": "2019-08-17", "url": "https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/hockey/4620136-Gophers-Mavericks-womens-hockey-teams-to-meet-in-USHHF-game", "content": "Hockey Gophers, Mavericks women's hockey teams to meet in USHHF game The annual college women's hockey game to raise awareness of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame will feature Minnesota vs. Minnesota State Mankato and will be played in Prior Lake, Minn., in December.

This OZY series takes you to the nations and individuals driving innovative solutions at the New Climate Change Frontiers. By Leslie Hook, Victor Mallet and Yasemin Craggs Mersinoglu The Daily Dose AUG 20 2019 When Greta Thunberg started a solo climate protest outside Sweden's parliament building last year, no one imagined it would spark a global movement that led to her being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. But as she sailed for the U.S. last Wednesday, having quit flying for environmental reasons, the 16-year-old has become the figurehead for European climate activism as the continent experiences a groundswell in support for Green parties. Thunberg's prominence has grown during 2019 as she has crisscrossed the continent to lobby political leaders and rally her young supporters as part of the weekly #FridaysForFuture school strikes. Yet the number and vehemence of her detractors have grown with her. Over the past 12 months, I suspect she has got a lot more airtime than the polar bear. <mark>Mike Hulme</mark>, a professor at Cambridge University The teenager--whose fame can be measured by the fact that she is almost always referred to by her first name only--has become a lightning rod for criticisms that are likely to intensify when she arrives in the more politically charged U.S. for next month's U.N. climate summit in New York. \"You can think of Greta as the new icon of climate change,\" said <mark>Mike Hulme</mark>, a professor at Cambridge University. \"Over the past 12 months, I suspect she has got a lot more airtime than the polar bear .\" The most vociferous attacks on Thunberg have come from far-right politicians and conservative writers. During a visit last month to France, when she addressed legislators, one lawmaker dismissed Thunberg as a \"prophetess in short trousers\" who would win a \"Nobel Prize for fear,\" while another called her an \"apocalyptic guru .\" Days later, an Australian columnist called her the \"deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement,\" prompting Thunberg to hit back. \"I am indeed\" deeply disturbed' about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on, \"the teenage activist wrote in a Twitter post .\" Where are the adults? \"And yet Thunberg's message has resonated across much of Europe, striking a chord with young people and a public that is increasingly concerned about climate breakdown and environmental issues. This summer, the U.K. and France adopted targets to cut carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050, and the Greens in Germany now have more political support than any other party. Thunberg's journey to New York on board the 60-foot carbon-fiber racing yacht Malizia II, with a small crew including skipper Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi, nephew of Prince Albert of Monaco, is expected to take two weeks .\" It will be quite an adventure, \"she said on Wednesday as she began her journey in Plymouth on England's south coast .\" I expect it will be challenging, maybe seasickness, \"she said, before adding:\" There are people in the world suffering more than that. \"Thunberg is far from a household name in the U.S., where opinion polls show growing concern about climate change but a wide gap between Republicans and Democrats on the issue. <mark>Richard Black</mark>, director at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit and author of Denied: The Rise and Fall of Climate Contrarianism, said the U.S.'s more polarized political discourse could result in her being targeted for criticism .\" It will be interesting to see whether there is any paid-for anti-Greta advocacy, \"he said, pointing to the funding for anti-climate action lobbying in the U.S.\" There will be one tranche that absolutely does not welcome her. \"While almost all of her critics are on the right, occasional voices from other parts of the political spectrum have also questioned her influence .\" When you consume Greta, you do not help the planet, \"Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven, a liberal French philosopher, wrote on Twitter a few days ago .\" You play the game of the system that destroys it. \"<mark>Black</mark> said of such reproval:\" She is also an intellectual threat, in that there is a kind of model of the political commentariat, that is used to being taken seriously, and she does not take them seriously. \"Others have asked whether Thunberg has gained excessive prominence. No one could argue about her significant influence: German Chancellor Angela Merkel credited the student protesters as she instructed her Cabinet to examine a carbon net-zero goal .\" It is quite interesting how rapidly she has gained this iconic power--almost mesmerizing power--given how partial and limited her political antenna and skills actually are, \"said <mark>Hulme</mark>.\" She is a legitimate representative, but should not be a hegemonic one. \"Within the youth movement that she inspired--school strikes have taken place in more than 100 countries--fellow activists insist Thunberg has always eschewed a leadership role, even if her speeches, viral tweets and social media posts ensure she remains in the public eye. Last week, Thunberg was among 400 young campaigners who gathered in Switzerland for the first Europe-wide meeting of her school strike movement .\" Everyone here obviously knows [that] Greta was the founder of the movement. But she has always been very specific that she is not the leader, \"said Mai Sheehan, a 16-year-old activist from Ireland .\" All our decisions are made on a consensus basis. \"As if to back this up, Thunberg was nowhere to be seen at the press conference on the final day of the gathering. But the movement she inspired continues to grow, with major global demonstrations planned for Sept. 20 and 27 .\" What often happens with Greta, is that the media frames her role as \"Jesus' and us as\" the disciples, \"' said Leonard Ganz, 21, from Germany .\" This is really a problem. \"He continued:\" She obviously is an inspiration for the movement...[but we] do not have that hierarchy. \"Timeline: Greta's rise to prominence August 2018 Greta Thunberg, 15, begins her protest against government inaction on climate change in front of Sweden's parliament building. She continues to protest each Friday, gaining worldwide attention and launching the #FridaysForFuture school strike movement. December 2018 Addresses leaders at the U.N.'s COP24 climate summit in Poland in a speech that becomes her first viral video. The following month she gives a talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos after a 32-hour train journey. March 2019 An estimated 1 million students take part in school strike protests across 125 countries, as Thunberg is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. April 2019 Time magazine names her one of the 100 most influential people of 2019. July 2019 OPEC Chief Mohammed Barkindo declares Thunberg and other activists the\" greatest threat \"to the fossil fuel industry. August 2019 Prepares to sail to the U.S. on board an environmentally friendly yacht to attend the U.N. climate summit in New York and a series of protests.

Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke for almost an hour on Monday evening, the two governments said. Mr Johnson said the agreement in its current form would not get through the House of Commons, while Mr Varadkar reiterated that it cannot be reopened.

The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by former prime minster <mark>Theresa May</mark>, is an insurance policy to prevent a hard border returning on the island of Ireland, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary.

Picture by <mark>Prem Singh</mark> Former Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, who is facing a summons from Bombay High Court in a suit filed by a technology company seeking Rs 10,000 crore in damages, has sought a copy of the complaint and other relevant documents from the firm. The high court on July 24 directed Chidambaram and two bureaucrats to remain present in person or through their lawyers on October 15 to respond to the claims made by the company, 63 Moons Technologies, formerly known as Financial Technologies Ltd.. On August 14, Chidambaram's lawyer Nitesh Jain sought a copy of the complaint and all documents that the company had relied upon. \"The summons was not accompanied by a copy of the plaint or any other annexures, hence the summons is in non-compliance with relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure,\" the letter by Chidambaram's lawyers said.

The company alleged that it was facing continuous \"targeted and malafide actions\" in the wake of an \"engineered payment default crisis\" at one of its subsidiaries, the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL). It claimed that the probe by multiple agencies did not find any money trail reaching NSEL, 63 Moons and its founder Jignesh Shah.
