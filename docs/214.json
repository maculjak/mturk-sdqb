last season ct-spt-0227-music-cubs-spring-trainin20110225 mesa, ariz. - unlike most teams, the cubs are forced to walk a fine line between progress and tradition. they were the last team to install lights, and one of the last to install rotating advertising boards behind home plate. the installation of the car sign in left field caused a stir last summer, and talk about bringing a jumbotron to wrigley has been debated for years. the cubs made one small change to tradition in 2010 to make their players happy, while aggravating a segment of their fan base. with no fanfare last june, they suddenly replaced gary pressy's organ music with snippets of taped music for hitters' intro songs. asked by a fan at the cubs convention why they were spoiling the \"<mark>tom ricketts</mark> recalled a conversation with an unnamed player who wanted the taped music to help the team out of its early-season slump.\" we weren't getting the clutch hits, we weren't scoring runs, \"<mark>ricketts</mark> told the fans.\" and a player came up and made that request. \"i was like,\" geez, we have traditions .' \"<mark>ricketts</mark> and the marketing department debated it, and ultimately decided to make the change.\" i said \"look, i know that it won't be popular with everybody, but if it shows the players that we're going to give them some support and try to shake things up and help things a little bit, then i'll give it a shot,'\" he told fans. marlon byrd confirmed he was the player <mark>ricketts</mark> cited and that he was trying to boost the team's morale. \"we were the only team not coming out to music,\" byrd said. \"i thought it'd be a good twist, with it being\" year one' with the <mark>ricketts</mark>. i understand you have to keep tradition, have to keep the organ. but change it up just a little bit. \"byrd's intro song was\" work \"by gang starr, which included the lyrics:\" i've been laying, waiting for your next mistake/i put in work, and watch my status escalate. \"he said he enjoyed seeing fans\" bobbing their heads in the stands \"when they heard his song, even if the sound system is so antiquated it barely could be heard. the reaction was split between the traditionalists and progressives. <mark>ricketts</mark> admitted to fans they received\" a lot of feedback from fans who preferred \"organ music to taped songs, and said they're considering whether or not to return to the old-school ways. infielder <mark>jeff baker</mark>, who came out to various beastie boys songs, said he hopes the rickettses keep the status quo.\" it creates a personality and an identity for each player, showing what you bring, and making your own stamp, \"<mark>baker</mark> said.\" i'm all for it. i know the majority of the players like it. i know it's a tough line for (the rickettses) because they're trying to balance the traditions of wrigley with what the players like and want. \"it's a tough call, but i hope they don't can it. it's not like you're replacing the organ music completely. you're just adding to it. i don't think it has ruined the fundamental history of wrigley.\" catcher koyie hill, who preferred striding to home plate to led zeppelin, said a new sound system would make the recorded music more palatable. \"if they're going to (play) music on that speaker system they have now, i don't know what the point is.\" hill said. \"but if guys in the room like it and that's their thing, i'm all for it. when you're up at the plate, or on the mound, it's your turn. so take your turn. if you want music, you get music. i'm a big traditional guy, but i'm also not ignorant to the modern stuff. i like a good mix.\" if the <mark>ricketts</mark> family decides to go back to organ music, byrd said the team can live with it. it's not a big deal, but one of those little \"chicago things\" chicagoans like to debate. \"i'm not part of the marketing department. so i'm not sure what kind of feedback they got,\" byrd said. \"if the fans didn't like it, we don't need to have it. they do need a new sound system. we need a lot of things. but i think the <mark>ricketts</mark> are going to take care of that, and if we did have one, it'd be pretty cool.\" i know, just looking in the stands, that a lot of people enjoyed it. it's all just fun, trying to keep it loose. it's too serious sometimes in chicago. we need to have fun.

His main role, though, is to collaborate with and annoy Adam as he plays through and suffered from terrible games, all in the name of entertainment. He presently serves as the main host and lead content creator and producer for the YouTube channel and gaming group called Funhaus, a division of Rooster Teeth as early as February of 2015 after previously being a part of Inside Gaming and Machinima. In addition, he is also the main Head and General Manager of Funhaus. Before fame, he was a DJ at the radio station in Santa Barbara. He later worked as a segment producer for Attack of the Show and reviewed technology products. In addition to this, he studied Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

It is said that <mark>Bruce</mark> has never ever shaved his body once. This assumption is supported by the fact that he has some royal chest and body hair, which can be seen in the latest strip video from him here. Also it's a fact that <mark>Bruce</mark> is\" shredded as hell \"as many people like to say, although he's hiding his muscles most of the time because he doesn't want Adam to become jealous. <mark>Bruce</mark>'s Bio Edit\" Born in the small town of Los Angeles, <mark>Bruce</mark> always wanted to become the world's greatest unicyclist At the tender age of 4, he was performing the fabled \"double puckle chuck\" when he fell, hit his head, and went into a coma. Fourteen years later, he woke up on the radio as a DJ in Santa Barbara with no knowledge of how he got there. As time passed, he learned to live and love again, and he was mentored by a jolly old fat man who showed him the 1 \u2032 s and 0 \u2032 s of life. As he was walking down the aisle at his college graduation, he grabbed the computer science diploma from his mentor and shook his hand, asking what was next. He whispered, \"Half-life 3,\" and <mark>Bruce</mark> never saw him again. Then <mark>Bruce</mark> worked on Attack of the Show at G4 and reviewed tech products for years. The end. \"--<mark>Bruce</mark>'s Bio...According to InsideGaming.com Early life and education Edit <mark>Bruce</mark> grew up primarily in Los Angeles County, California where he attended elementary and secondary school. Ever since he was <mark>young</mark>, <mark>Bruce</mark> had always wanted to become the world's greatest unicyclist during his childhood. At the age of 4, in 1985, he fell down, hit his head, and went into a coma after being severely injured. He was hospitalized following this injury and fortunately recovered.

1,500 to make. hours of shooting took place at rhondda heritage park and the joseph parry cottage in merthyr tydfil as well as the reform church in senghenydd, which was where many of the miners' funerals took place. film maker paris palmer, 22, who works at zipline creative in new tredegar, said: \"it did take a lot of people and work to turn the idea into a reality.\" when i first became involved, i had no idea about the senghenydd disaster. \"but i thought what a great story it was about andrew's great grandfather.\" that's the key with documentaries, it's about telling stories. \"the more i got involved, the more attached i got to the story. it would be hard for anyone not to.\" andrew and his colleagues have since posted the docu-drama, entitled mourning of the valley, onto the internet but are hoping to get interest from production companies who may be working on commemorating next year's 100th anniversary. if given the opportunity, they would like to re-shoot the film into a full length documentary suitable for broadcasting. andrew, who works at film company gingenius in cardiff, said: \"everybody who has had anything to do with it has said they enjoyed making it and the end result looks awesome.\" i think it pays justice to those involved, acts as a memorial to those who lost their lives and remembers those who survived. \"it also shows what dangerous conditions miners worked in.\" they didn't have choice back then because that's all the work there was in the valleys but there was a high price to pay for many. \"it was important for us to show this but also to remember such a big portion of the population which died that day.\" walesonline, the best source for welsh news, sport, business and entertainment. powered by the western mail, south wales echo, wales on sunday and celtic weekly newspapers. produced by media wales ltd. ."}, {"articleID": "2019010502_00140873_W", "names": {"Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"], "Mike Holmes": ["Q14950204", "Q20676979", "Q6847289", "Q6847291", "Q6847293"]}, "date": "2019-01-05", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/games/69413/FIFA", "content": "FIFA 18 REVIEW.

Researchers say it also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. Share: FULL STORY A lack of sleep doesn't just leave you cranky and spoiling for a fight. Researchers at The Ohio State University Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research say it also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. This type of inflammation is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and other diseases. \"We know sleep problems are also linked with inflammation and many of the same chronic illnesses. So we were interested to see how sleep related to inflammation among married couples, and whether one partner's sleep affected the other's inflammation,\" said <mark>Stephanie Wilson</mark>, lead researcher on the study. Results of the study were published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology. The research team recruited 43 couples who completed two study visits. Each time, the couples provided blood samples and said how many hours they had slept the previous two nights. Then researchers had the couples try to resolve a topic that sparks conflict in their marriage. Blood samples were taken again following the discussion. \"We found that people who slept less in the past few nights didn't wake up with higher inflammation, but they had a greater inflammatory response to the conflict. So that tells us less sleep increased vulnerability to a stressor,\" <mark>Wilson</mark> said. If both partners got less than seven hours of sleep the previous two nights, the couple was more likely to argue or become hostile. For every hour of sleep lost, the researchers noted that levels of two known inflammatory markers rose 6 percent. Couples who used unhealthy tactics in their disagreement had an even greater inflammatory response--about a 10 percent increase with each hour of less sleep. \"Any increase isn't good, but a protracted increase that isn't being addressed is where it can become a problem,\" <mark>Wilson</mark> said. \"What's concerning is both a lack of sleep and marital conflict are common in daily life. About half of our study couples had slept less than the recommended seven hours in recent nights.\" That's higher than the current national average. The CDC reports 35 percent of Americans get less than seven hours of sleep per night. \"Part of the issue in a marriage is that sleep patterns often track together. If one person is restless, or has chronic problems, that can impact the other's sleep. If these problems persist over time, you can get this nasty reverberation within the couple,\" said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, senior author and director of the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research. Researchers were encouraged to see that there was a protective effect if one of the partners was well-rested, or discussed conflict in a healthy way. They tended to neutralize the disagreement that might be stirred by the sleep-deprived partner. \"We would tell people that it's important to find good ways to process the relationship and resolve conflict--and get some sleep,\" Kiecolt-Glaser said.

Patrick Semansky Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)--The Latest on the January Democratic presidential debate (all times local): 10:25 p.m. Six Democratic presidential candidates have wrapped up their final debate before primary voting begins with talk of hope, defeating President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> and bringing a divided nation back together. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday that \"character is on the ballot\" in the 2020 election and that eight years of <mark>Trump</mark> in office would be \"an absolute disaster.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said \"this is the moment when we have got to think big, not small,\" and have courage to take on the \"1%,\" while Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she has hope in America's future despite its challenges and looks forward to becoming the first female president. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she'll be a president who finds \"common ground instead of scorched earth\" to get things done, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg says Democrats will get one shot to win big and \"send Trumpism into the dustbin of history.\" Businessman Tom Steyer says he thinks of the American people as his teammates, and pledged he won't permit \"someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face.\" ------10:05 p.m. Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg says he will keep up his effort to appeal to black voters, whose support will be vital to winning his party's nomination. The former mayor said during Tuesday night's debate in Des Moines, Iowa, that \"the black voters who know me best are supporting me,\" referencing local leaders in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg has built up support in some of the early states but has struggled in South Carolina, where black voters comprise the majority of the Democratic primary electorate. It's the first state where candidates' mettle with black voters is tested. Buttigieg pointed Tuesday to his endorsement from U.S. Rep. <mark>Anthony Brown</mark> of Maryland, who earlier this month became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to back Buttigieg's campaign .------9:55 p.m. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar says the upcoming Senate trial on President <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s impeachment \"is a decency check on our government.\" \"This is a patriotism check,\" she added at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, noting the upcoming 2020 election is yet another check. Klobuchar and her fellow senators running for president will have to contend with the impeachment trial as the push to the Iowa caucuses enters its final days. Other candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will be able to continue campaigning freely as the Senate trial gets underway. Klobuchar also criticized her Senate Republican colleagues over reluctance to allow certain witnesses for the Senate trial, saying, \"We've asked for only four people.\" \"And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king,\" Klobuchar said .------9:45 p.m. Joe Biden says the outcome of a Senate impeachment trial against President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> won't affect his arguments against the Republican president in the 2020 campaign. And the former vice president said at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate that it's \"irrelevant\" whether <mark>Trump</mark> claims exoneration if the Republican-led Senate votes as expected and doesn't remove him from office. Biden said House Democrats had \"no choice\" but to impeach the president for <mark>Trump</mark>'s efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch investigations into Biden's son Hunter's business dealings in the country and his own foreign policy engagement in Ukraine when he was vice president. <mark>Trump</mark>'s claims about the Bidens have been debunked. But Biden said he expects <mark>Trump</mark> and Republicans to continue to allege that the Bidens are corrupt. \"I did my job,\" Biden said at the debate .------9:35 p.m.. It all comes back to health care. Even after Democratic presidential candidates had an extended foreign policy discussion at Tuesday's presidential debate, they saved the fireworks for another fight over how to expand health insurance coverage. Joe Biden suggested that Bernie Sanders wasn't being \"candid\" with voters over the cost of his single-payer insurance idea. Amy Klobuchar said \"Medicare for All\" is so impractical that the \"debate isn't real.\" And Pete Buttigieg bristled at the suggestion that adding a \"public option\" plan to the existing market isn't a major step forward. Sanders said those more moderate candidates misrepresent a plan he said would indeed increase Americans' taxes but eliminate the \"absurdity\" of private insurance costs. Elizabeth Warren tried a bit of a twist. She defended single payer, but noted that Republicans want to roll back even existing coverage. \"I'll take our side of the argument any day,\" she said of the entire Democratic field .------9:25 p.m. Former Vice President Joe Biden says one of his top rivals needs to \"be candid\" with voters on the cost of his health care reform proposal. Biden said Tuesday during the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders should be more upfront with voters on how much it will cost to move the country to a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" system. Asked if voters deserved more information on the price of his signature proposal, Sanders maintained his argument that his proposal \"wouldn't bankrupt the country\" because it would end out-of-pocket and prescription drug prices. Biden proposes making fixes to the existing Affordable Care Act system, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg proposes somewhat of a hybrid. Noting she would use executive power to cut prescription drug prices, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said her $20-plus trillion plan costs more than those ideas because they represent only incremental change .------9:10 p.m. Elizabeth Warren's argument that a woman is best suited to take on President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> led to a prolonged awkward dispute with Bernie Sanders. Sanders denied during Tuesday night's debate that he told Warren in 2018 that he didn't think a woman could beat <mark>Trump</mark>. Warren says he did and argued Tuesday night that she's the only candidate on stage who defeated an incumbent Republican candidate any time in the last 30 years. The Vermont senator disputed that, arguing that he defeated incumbent Republican <mark>Peter Smith</mark> in a 1990 congressional race. Warren then began counting quietly with her finger, asking, \"Wasn't it 30 years ago?\" Sanders noted his win again and then said the dispute isn't a pressing concern .------9:05 p.m. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren declined an opportunity to continue their recent campaign trail feud during Tuesday night's debate, but Warren still took on her progressive opponent. Sanders again denied that he told Warren in a private 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't win the presidency. He called it \"incomprehensible\" that he would believe such a thing and said he didn't want to \"waste a whole lot of time\" on the issue \"because this is what <mark>Donald Trump</mark>... wants.\" He also committed to doing \"everything in my power\" to making sure the eventual nominee wins. Warren has said Sanders did in fact tell her a woman can't win, and on the debate stage, she took on the issue of whether a woman can win head-on. Warren told the crowd that the male candidates on the stage collectively lost 10 races while she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar were \"the only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in.\" She also argued that female candidates have outperformed men, noting that female candidates and voters were pivotal in taking back the House and flipping statehouses during the last midterms. Warren pivoted to an implicit contrast with Sanders on electability, arguing that \"the real danger\" for Democrats \"is picking a candidate who can't pull our party together.\" ------9 p.m. Former Vice President Joe Biden and businessman Tom Steyer say they would not meet with North Korea's leader without \"preconditions,\" as President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> has done. Biden said at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate in Iowa that <mark>Trump</mark>'s meetings with <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark> gave the North Korean leader \"legitimacy,\" and he criticized <mark>Trump</mark> for weakening sanctions against the country. He said his approach to North Korea would include working with China and Japan. Biden also noted that <mark>Kim</mark> once described him as a \"rabid dog\" who \"must be beaten with a stick.\" Steyer, a billionaire businessman, said the U.S. would need to work with its allies in regard to North Korea. He said staff could meet \"and see how far we can get.\" ------8:55 p.m.. What has become a signature trade deal of President <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s administration is a conflict point among the Democrats competing to replace him. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, that he opposes the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, in part because it \"does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.\" Asked why she backed the deal, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was a \"modest improvement\" over existing agreements and could be a placeholder for future reform. Former Vice President Joe Biden said that, as president, he wouldn't push a trade deal that didn't include buy-in from environmentalists and unionists. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she backed the deal, as did former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said it \"has been improved. It is not perfect.\" ------8:35 p.m.. There's a divide in Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate over the American military footprint abroad. The leading progressive candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, blasted the trillions of dollars that the U.S. has spent in Middle East wars since the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Warren said \"We have to stop this mindset\" and bring home \"combat troops.\" The more moderate candidates countered that a U.S. presence is necessary in the Middle East, though former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg said the focus should be on small special forces. To some degree, the debate is about framing. Sanders and Warren don't go so far as to say they would never order military deployments. Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg are careful to express caution about large, extended missions of ground troops. But the differences highlight two distinct foreign policy camps within the Democratic Party .------8:25 p.m. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders says he fears that President <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s actions involving Iran could be leading the United States into a foreign policy quagmire of the highest level. The Vermont senator said at Tuesday night's Democratic candidate debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, that what he sees as the country's top foreign policy disasters - the wars in Vietnam and Iraq - were \"based on lies.\" Sanders accused <mark>Trump</mark> of being dishonest about the intelligence that led to the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Sanders pressed the need for an international coalition, adding, \"We cannot keep acting unilaterally.\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this week that he had seen no hard evidence that four American embassies had been under threat when <mark>Trump</mark> authorized the targeting of Iran's top commander, raising questions about the scale of the threat described by <mark>Trump</mark> last week .------8:15 p.m. Former Vice President Joe Biden wasted no time in the opening minutes of Democrats' presidential debate in calling his 2002 vote authorizing an Iraq invasion a mistake. It was an unusually matter-of-fact tone of contrition for Biden, especially as he tries to emphasize his long foreign policy record as a vice president and a six-term U.S. senator. The 77-year-old candidate has throughout his campaign mostly defended portions of his record that have come under criticism from his party's progressive flank. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders nonetheless tried to capitalize on the issue Tuesday night. He pointed out that he voted against the Bush administration's war powers request as a member of the House, and he called the war the \"worst foreign policy blunder in history.\" Biden maintained that he'd compare his \"record overall\" to any of his Democratic competitors, and he pointed to his role in the Obama administration in dramatically scaling back U.S. involvement in Iraq .------8 p.m. Six Democratic presidential candidates are taking the debate stage in Des Moines, Iowa, in a final showdown before primary voting begins. The half dozen candidates on stage Tuesday are all white and include four men. It's a stark winnowing of the Democratic field that was once the most diverse in history. The first debate of 2020 is starting with fresh tension between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Warren said Monday night that Sanders privately told her in 2018 that he didn't think a woman could defeat President <mark>Donald Trump</mark>. Sanders has vigorously denied making the comment. The dispute isn't likely to be the only one on stage. Sanders has ratcheted up his criticism of Vice President Joe Biden over his past support of the Iraq War and other issues. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is looking to break out of the pack, building on strong debates and her arguments that former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg doesn't have enough experience to be president. Billionaire Tom Steyer is expected to face criticism that he's trying to buy his way to the White House as he floods early voting states with campaign ads .------Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \"Ground Game.\" Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
