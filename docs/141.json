tuesday's reveal was that he pays an effective partial disclosure in the spring, but has not been specific about how many years of returns he would make available. the awkwardness with which romney is handling the question-including a halting performance at a republican candidates debate monday night-is proving to be a serious distraction, and a contrast to the generally smooth fashion by which his campaign has dispatched most controversies, according to several operatives. \"it's not that they are hiding anything, it's not that they are doing anything illegal, but they have a baseline belief that there is no good that comes from releasing their tax returns,\" said <mark>rick wilson</mark>, who worked for rudy giuliani's 2008 campaign. \"it's a natural sense of caution that these guys have .\" and on top of that, romney's got an unenviable contrast as he looks toward the general election: barack obama released six years' worth of tax returns by march 2008, and has released them every year he's been in the white house. making it worse - the person who set the precedent of releasing returns that every major presidential candidate since has followed was romney's own father, who put out 12 years' worth a year before his own 1968 run. the returns are sure to cause problems for romney - running in a recession with every one of his many millions of dollars revealed isn't the image he'll want, and it's almost inevitable that some of his investments will run him into political trouble. but he was going to be pressed to release them at some point ahead of november, and the intensity of attacks he's been facing since monday night's debate suggest that he's only hurting himself by not having released them already. \"it doesn't seem to make sense to me,\" said chip saltsman, who managed mike huckabee's 2008 campaign. \"now that he's really put himself in to a box on this, he's going to have to release them sooner than april. my guess is there's lots of fun stuff in there .\" it's a replay of romney's bumbling initial response to the attacks on his bain record, a campaign appearing to be caught flat-footed as a narrative that could last through the general election took hold. the tax return storyline threatens to be the next cut in a dangerous narrative for romney: that he got rich by exploiting the little guy and isn't interested in explaining the details. romney hasn't helped his case. pressed at the debate, he first dodged a question from rick perry about the tax returns, then offered a halting response when moderator kelly evans followed up. cayman islands mittens mitt romneys probably using bernie madoffs accountants. my prediction: some hedge fund shorting activity. probably shorting mortgage backed securities. imagine the headlines: willard bets against america!", "articleID": "2012011801_00015479_W", "names": {"Rick Wilson": ["Q16186444", "Q16196773", "Q28421760", "Q3431613", "Q605482", "Q7331863", "Q7331864"]}}, {"date": "2012-01-18", "url": "http://westkentuckystar.com/News/Local---Regional/Western-Kentucky/MCU-Inks-Nashville-Central-Christian-s-Taylor", "content": "mcu inks nashville central christian's <mark>taylor</mark> mayfield, ky -
