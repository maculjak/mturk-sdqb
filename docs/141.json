Countries within the Customs Union and subject to the EU's Common Commerical Policy are cannot sign their own trade agreements, with trade policy being managed by Brussels.

The man, 62, was taken from his boat on the South Alligator River in northern Australia's Kakadu national park late Saturday afternoon as his wife, son and daughter-in-law looked on. Northern Territory police sergeant Andrew Hocking said two large crocodiles were shot and cut open by search crews Sunday at the waterhole where the man was last seen. \"One of those crocs was later examined and a quantity of human remains was recovered,\" Hocking told reporters, adding that the creature had been 4.7 metres long. The remains were yet to be formally identified, but Hocking said the animal was recovered just 1.5 kilometres from the attack site. \"The difficulty in this location is getting in large boats, we're only able to bring in small boats. But using the expertise of the Territory Parks and Wildlife staff, they managed to help us bring it to a conclusion,\" he said. \"Thankfully this was carried out and (the remains) recovered very, very quickly.\" Crocodile expert Graeme Webb said it was unusual for a crocodile to attack at this time of the year, when Australia experiences cooler weather. \"I don't know what has happened in this case but it just sounds horrific. It's just awful, you just can't begin to understand how (the man's family) must feel.\" While the man's wife and daughter-in-law drove two hours to the nearest lodge to raise the alarm his son remained in the area searching for his father, which Superintendent <mark>Bob Harrison</mark> earlier described as \"obviously traumatising\" \"Anyone's heart would go out to the family in that sort of incident,\" <mark>Harrison</mark> told ABC radio. Crocodiles are a common feature of Australia's tropical north, and their numbers have increased steadily since the introduction of protection laws in 1971, with government estimates putting the population at 75 000 - 100 000. Saltwater crocs can grow up to seven metres long and weigh more than a tonne. Saturday's attack is Australia's first fatality since January, when a 12-year-old boy was taken by a crocodile in the Kakadu national park, a sprawling World Heritage-listed nature and cultural reserve in Australia's Top End. Another boy suffered bite wounds in that incident as he fought the crocodile off. According to the international CrocBITE database of attacks set up at Australia's Charles Darwin University last year, there have been 66 fatalities globally so far in 2014. comment guidelines.

There was a sense of anticipation Wednesday morning at the Zions Bank Basketball Campus, as the Jazz went through shootaround a few hours ahead of their regular-season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder. After all the talk, the team is ready to get out there and see how they actually look in a game that matters. \"It's hard to gauge everything that you see in practice until you start playing games, whether it's preseason games or, obviously the regular season. First and foremost, we'll get a chance to see where we are,\" said coach Quin Snyder. \"...It's gotta be about the process of how we're coming together. Also, what's our level today?\" While opening nights are now old hat for veteran point guard Mike Conley, even he couldn't deny that the circumstances will make this one a bit unique and special. \"This is new--it's all new for me. It's my 13th year, but my first year outside of Memphis, so a whole new environment, new fans, new team. I'm just excited to get going,\" he said. He offered that the week of practices between the preseason finale and tonight's opener were devoted pretty much exclusively to defensive improvement, noting, \"I don't think we took any shots.\" He expects that as all the new players become increasingly familiar with both the concepts and each other, progress will come. That's what Snyder will be on the lookout for, as well, to determine how to proceed. \"There's a lot of analysis, and we don't want to overreact to a result, but also, there's nothing that you ignore,\" Snyder said. \"You go with the plan, and then you figure out when to implement and what to implement. If I see 10 things I'd like us to do better, we're not gonna fix 10 things in just a few days.\" In case you missed it First off, the important stuff: The Jazz will be making a \"major\" announcement Wednesday at 3:30.

The new contract will see the 30-year-old make himself available for all forms of the game, continuing his 12-year affiliation with the White Rose county. Rashid, who made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 2006, had initially signed a one-year contract at the start of the year so that he was only involved in one-day formats. But he was selected for England's recent home Test series against India, playing all five Tests in a 4-1 victory. He has also included for the tour to Sri Lanka in October and he will hope good form for Yorkshire can strengthen his claim for next summer's home Ashes. Yorkshire's Director of Cricket, Martyn Moxon, said: \"There's been a lot of talk and speculation but Adil is a very valuable cricketer for us.\" Now he's in the Test team, how much he'll be available for us next season is unclear. But when he is available we'd be delighted to have him and for him to be part of what would hopefully be a successful summer. \"For now, it will just be for a year because it's still not clear what career path he's going to take. He's back in the Test team and continues to do well, so we'll see where that takes us.\" Obviously going into 2020 and with the new competition, players are waiting to see how that will affect contracts. \"I think for now it's good to have the one year and see how the winter goes for Adil. We'll probably have another look at it after the World Cup and see where he is, particularly with England and how much he's involved with them.\" In the short-term it's good to know when he's available he'll be playing for us. \"Rashid has taken 500 first-class wickets at an average of 34.98. All of his 10 hundreds have come for the White Rose. The leg-spinner made his Test bow in 2015 on tour of the UAE against Pakistan and has made 15 appearances to date in te longest format. Rashid was recently told by England selector <mark>Ed Smith</mark> that he must be available across the board from the start of next summer to be considered for Test cricket. Moxon continued:\" It was a big surprise that he wanted to play white ball only and asked us for a white-ball only contract. That changed very quickly and unexpectedly so that created a bit of confusion and instability for a little while. \"But I think we've been clear from the outset that we wanted to keep Adil at the club. When it became known he had to have a red-ball contract, we were more than happy to put that in place.\" Speaking to Adil he's keen to stay here and has been here all his life. He's in no mood to change that. We're really pleased to keep him. \"We all know he's a matchwinner for us. Leg-spin bowlers, wrist-spin bowlers are vital part of the game and that's what we want from Adil, that potential to be a matchwinner for us in all formats.\" Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Send email Mail Countries County Cricket England News Top Story"}, {"articleID": "2019102315_00152167_W", "names": {"Tom Brady": ["Q2376327", "Q313381", "Q7815037"], "Greg Hill": ["Q11163426", "Q16729823", "Q19663103", "Q30612101", "Q5605708", "Q5605710"], "Alex Guerrero": ["Q15119311", "Q4717106", "Q56275288"]}, "date": "2019-10-23", "url": "http://www.bostonherald.com/2019/10/23/patriots-qb-tom-brady-on-retirement-speculation-i-dont-know-what-the-future-holds/", "content": "FOXBORO, MA .--OCTOBER 8: <mark>Tom Brady</mark> #12 of the New England Patriots speaks to reporters at Gillette Stadium on October 8, 2019 in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

He didn't exactly shoot down any of the talk. He said he was uncertain about his future. \"That is the great part for me, I don't know,\" <mark>Brady</mark> said. \"I think that has been a unique situation that I have been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years you kind feel like (there is) the responsibility to always fulfill the contract.

Employers added only 160,000 jobs in April, lower than the 200,000 many economists had predicted. The unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent, the Labor Department said today. Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 200,000 per month, with April's gains the weakest since last September. The Labor Department also revised down its employment figures in February and March by a combined 19,000. While the report may worry some economists, college grads entering the labor force can still remain optimistic. The unemployment rate for college graduates ages 25 and over as of April was 2.4 percent, the lowest level since June 2008. \"This year's graduating college seniors aren't looking at the monthly numbers so much, or the story of the day,\" said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com senior economic analyst. The addition of an average of 224,000 jobs per month over the past year is \"far above\" what is needed to keep up with normal growth in the labor force, said Gus Faucher, PNC deputy chief economist. Wage growth is also picking up as the job market tightens, which means higher starting pay, he explained. Students graduating with degrees in science, technology, engineering or business, should fare even better in the job market, Hamrick said. Labor force participation in April edged down a bit to 62.8 percent. \"That's not what we want to see, but also not a huge surprise,\" Hamrick said. On the positive side, there was a modest rise in wage growth with average hourly earnings up 2.5 percent over the past year. \"That's not a jackpot for American workers, but it is progress,\" he said. PNC chief economist Stuart Hoffman pointed out that there has been noteworthy job increases in nearly every sector but energy-related ones. He is upbeat on graduates entering the financial services industries, such as accounting, as well as those with science and engineering degrees. \"If your major is engineering in mining, obviously it's not a good time, but still those skills are applicable in a lot of industries,\" Hoffman said. Health care fields are another bright spot for graduating seniors. \"Four or five yeas ago, that was really tough job market particularly for younger people out of school. It's a much more hospitable, but not to say easy job market for recent or soon-to-be graduates,\" Hoffman said. \"I wouldn't take the April jobs report to be a bummer.\" Hoffman also expects the number of job listings to reach a record high.
