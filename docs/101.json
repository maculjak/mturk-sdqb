of the music's greatest legend. blues at the crossroads when: 8 p.m. sun. when todd park mohr's manager suggested that he record an album in tribute to the 100th birthday of legendary bluesman <mark>robert johnson</mark>, his first reaction was understandably negative. mohr, aka big head todd, is best known for crooning such pop songs as \"bittersweet\" with his colorado band big head todd and the monsters. \"i resisted the idea kicking and screaming,\" he said. \"i know a lot of guys out there live and breathe <mark>robert johnson</mark>, and i wasn't that familiar with his music. i didn't know if i had a lot to offer .\" but less than a year later, mohr has not only immersed himself in <mark>johnson</mark>'s music to create a proper recording for the man's centennial, he's touring with legends such as howlin' wolf guitarist hubert sumlin and 95-year-old honeyboy edwards (who knew <mark>johnson</mark> personally) under the name of the big head blues club. the group--which includes mohr's cohorts from the monsters plus an assortment of new and old blues hounds--will play sunday at orchestra hall, its penultimate gig on a 21-city all-blues tour. the title of the concert, \"blues at the crossroads,\" is doubly suggestive. it invokes the legend that, one midnight at a crossroads in mississippi, <mark>johnson</mark> made a deal with the devil, who tuned his guitar and gave him special blues powers in exchange for his soul. one of <mark>johnson</mark>'s best-known songs, \"cross roads blues\" (later covered by eric clapton's cream), helps to fortify this outsized tale in people's minds. but in a more sober vein, blues music really is at a crossroads, with only a few of the seminal delta musicians who migrated north to play and record the blues, such as edwards and pianist pinetop perkins, still alive today. most of the titans who came to prominence in the blues revival of the 1960s and '70s are gone. and while there are pockets of stellar blues musicians from succeeding generations who keep the flame alive, its potency has diminished on the music scene. \"i think there is something of a regeneration happening to blues music, with the white stripes and the black keys and others drawing heavily from the delta blues,\" mohr said. \"i know i can feel a need and a readiness out there for the emotional part of blues music to be current again .\" forefathers and sons \"the blues? i don't care what happens, the blues is gonna be here,\" said sumlin, 79, with a mischievous laugh. \"everything else is gonna die before the blues .\" hearing sumlin play--be it on old howlin' wolf recordings, his performances last year on a jimi hendrix tribute tour, or with the big head blues club--it's tempting to believe him. and when mohr reports that 95-year-old honeyboy edwards is a fixture on the tour bus, and that sumlin constantly regales him with stories from the road and has \"been like a father to me,\" that passing of the baton seems a bit more secure. sure, sumlin is engaging in howler-caliber hype when he insists that \"these big head todd and his monsters can play <mark>robert johnson</mark> as good as <mark>robert johnson</mark> hisself .\" but when mohr opens the gigs with a heartfelt acoustic rendition of \"love in vain\" or \"stones in my passway\" on dobro or guitar and vocal, it's apparent he's following the tradition while being true to himself and ever-conscious of the danger of becoming a charlatan. the same can be said of the other three members of big head todd and the monsters. ditto drummer cedric burnside, grandson of the late blues singer r.l. burnside and the 2010 blues music awards drummer of the year, who teams with slide guitarist lightnin' malcolm on the record and the current tour. that's malcolm stinging his slide behind honeyboy edwards, or on a solo rendition of a son house tune. without question, something precious will be lost with the passing of edwards, perkins, sumlin and others. but it has always been that way. meanwhile, something precious is also being savored, and retained. \"i told my producer, clive goldsmith, that i've been waiting 30 years to make this record,\" said mohr, who had a hit single when he and the monsters were joined by <mark>john lee</mark> hooker for a cover of hooker's classic blues \"boom boom,\" and who included the blues standard \"smokestack lightning\" on their last album in 2010. \"i am delighted to be in this period of rediscovery and enlightenment. the music i make [from now on] will always be affected by this. - the garfunkel-less

"content": "tweet when pope benedict xvi writes that the jews are not responsible for the death of jesus, what's important is less the passage itself than the man who put it down on paper. by tackling the subject in a book to be published march 10, benedict, whose has struggled in his relations with the jewish community, doesn't so much state something new - the affirmation that the jewish people as a whole were not responsible for the crucifixion is an old one, uncontroversial in the modern catholic church - as lend the idea the ecclesiastical equivalent of a celebrity endorsement. \"the significance is in the author,\" says joseph sievers, professor of jewish history at the pontifical biblical institute in rome. \"he brings together an awareness of the issues in the text themselves with the history of how these texts have been interpreted through the last 2,000 years .\" indeed, the catholic church has considered the jewish people free from blame since at least 1965, when the second vatican council wrote that while \"the jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of christ; still, what happened in his passion cannot be charged against all the jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the jews of today .\" the difference this time is that rather than being buried deep in a document of dense text, where it can easily be overlooked or ignored, the argument is being laid out by a man whose every word is pored over as an indication of church doctrine. \"most catholics don't read the church's documents,\" says rabbi <mark>david rosen</mark>, director of interreligious affairs at the new york-based american jewish committee. \"the book will certainly be far more widely read .\" benedict's last book, jesus of nazareth, was a best seller when it was published in 2007. the passage about the crucifixion will appear in its sequel, jesus of nazareth: holy week: from the entrance into jerusalem to the resurrection (see \"the trial of pope benedict xvi .\" ) in excerpts provided to the press this week, the pope walks the reader through the gospels to explore who jesus' accusers really were. noting that the gospel of john describes them as \"the jews,\" benedict explains that there's no way the writer meant the entire population of israel. after all, he notes, john himself was a jew, as was jesus and the rest of his followers. \"this expression has a precise and rigorously limited meaning,\" benedict concludes: \"the temple aristocracy .\" the gospel of mark expands the circle of accusers to \"the masses,\" which benedict explains were supporters of barabbas, the brigand chosen by the crowd to be released instead of jesus. \"in [the second vatican council's text], this was all said in one sentence, but here it's spelled out and worked out in great detail,\" says sievers. the pope pays special attention to a passage in the gospel of matthew which is often used to stir up anti-semitism. in that passage, pontius pilate, the roman prefect overseeing the crucifixion, washes his hands and declares himself to be innocent of the death of jesus: \"then the people as a whole answered,\" his blood be on us and on our children!' \"benedict argues that the phrase\" the people as a whole \"is ahistorical .\" how would it have been possible for the entire population to have been present at that moment to ask for the death of jesus? \"he writes. the blood of jesus, he adds, should not be seen as a call for revenge, but spilled in the name of reconciliation:\" not a curse, but redemption, salvation. \"should celebrities donate money they made off the gaddafi family? abdul hafif goga, a spokesman for rebels fighting libya's muammar gaddafi, on reports that the embattled

<mark>locke</mark>'s body? will we see theresa again? and which lost actor does damon most want to see on \"dancing with the stars\" ? we will answer to those questions and more in today's official lost audio podcast. lost start theme. (kris white's introducing part which is not very useful) damon lindelof: wow! a foreign tongue this morning! hello, carlton! carlton cuse: oui. what's going on, damon? damon lindelof: we're doing a podcast apparently sitting on the couch. carlton cuse: sitting on the couch. we got our wonderful producer kris white here today with this hi-tech car board box with microphones on it and? damon lindelof: we spare no expense for you guys. carlton cuse: this is a very classy podcast. we're gonna rehash the most reason episode of lost \"this place is death\" damon lindelof: really a nice? just i fill good theme. carlton cuse: i think as the season goes on if you as welcome to see there were dead or death appears in many of the titles this year. damon lindelof: right. ironically, we were just talking about the writers offices that day and decided to title the episode \"this place is death\" and gave this line to charlotte to justify it. carlton cuse: it's actually more fun than death to be in the writer's offices. they're really? damon lindelof:? slightly. i mean i've never been dead, so, i don't know? <mark>locke</mark>? looks like he is having a good time. looks like he is relaxing. carlton cuse: yes. there is not a lot of stress for him at the moment. damon lindelof: which is more than i can say for us. carlton cuse: that's true. we have a lot of stress. we're trying to get the finale written right know. but we are taking a little brief interlude to have this podcast. so, let's get ride to little recap here damon. so, this was the big rousseau story that we were promising the viewers about, was it not? damon lindelof: yes, well we said we'd be seen rousseau again and we sure did? and as opposed to doing it? cause? since? rousseau was shot last year by keamy and his pals. the only way to do it was time travel. so, that when we're sitting around going \"well, the fans really want more rousseau, let's introduce time travel into the show, that's probably the best way to do it\". so, we hope you're happy. carlton cuse: and you saw brennan and robert and lacombe? damon lindelof: and of course, montand (carlton and damon are pronouncing \"montand\" together). so, the big mystery of montand's arm is finally been revealed. carlton cuse: the truth for us was that we really didn't give much of a damn about telling rousseau's back story, but were incredibly determined to explain to the audience how montand lost his arm. damon lindelof: and we're gonna go a lot further with it but if you look very carefully - there is a violin case that montand is carrying around. so the whole idea that montand was an aspiring concert violinist once he finished this research trip. the fact that he lost his arm is all the more tragic. carlton cuse: yeah. well, apparently, the arm was the least of his problems ultimately, wasn't it? damon lindelof: that is true. carlton cuse: he got sucked down there by smokey into? would you say that's smokey's main house or his summer palace? damon lindelof: i would say it's his camp david. when he is not where he lives, that's just where he hangs out. we referred it internally as the declivity. carlton cuse: the declivity in the temple wall. damon lindelof: yes, exactly. well that isn't necessarily saying that that is the temple. but that is perhaps the outer wall of the temple. carlton cuse: yes. the temple would be just on the other side, you might have to hike a little bit. damon lindelof: will we be returning to this location again, carlton? carlton cuse: damn straight we will, damon. damon lindelof: and are we supposed to infer that as a result of descending into the declivity when robert and the rest of the team went down there that they came back a little different? carlton cuse: they came back a little wacky and rousseau was very concerned about their behavior. whatever happened to them down there the encounter with smokey did alter them and not for the better. damon lindelof: they didn't seem wacky to me, they seem perfectly rational, except robert tries to shoot rousseau of course. carlton cuse: yeah. that wasn't good. but then of course rousseau had popped? i assume that was brennan and lacombe. damon lindelof: yes. so, it's which, who went wacky first, the chicken-and-the-egg. carlton cuse: we also saw a very sane rousseau at least at the beginning of this. very kind of a wonderful actress. rousseau was kind of a nice girl until everything went wrong for her, wasn't she? damon lindelof: yeah. well, you know, the island will do it to you. especially when people are flashing into out of existence and disappear and? oh, it's just a wild and wildly place, isn't it? carlton cuse: that is a very wild and wildly place. so, i don't think we can really say too much about episode 507 other than it's called \"316\" which is confusing enough in itself. damon lindelof: speaking of confusing. when carlton says \"episode 507\" which is the next episode you seen? we actually wrote 506 and 507 fairly simultaneously. carlton and i wrote both those scripts. you know, one of them is called \"the life and death of jeremy bentham\" , the other is \"316\" , and for reasons that will become apparent you once you've seen both episodes - they can sort of be watched in either order. but we actually felt like the order that made more sense, i mean was cooler, was to show \"507\" first. this is only happened once before in the history of the show for those of you die-hard fans, we challenge you to figure out when that was. carlton cuse: that was way back. damon lindelof: way back in season 1. carlton cuse: in season 1. so, anyway, \"316\" felt like it was better to see in front of the \"the life and death of jeremy bentham\". and that episode as the title may infer, you know, has to do with <mark>locke</mark>. but i, there is probably some good information to get in \"316\" before we get to explaining how was that <mark>locke</mark>? well i guess if it's called \"the life and death?\" i would assume that we're gonna find out? damon lindelof: how <mark>locke</mark> ended up in that coffin. carlton cuse: that's right. damon lindelof: it's exciting. carlton cuse: that's good. damon lindelof: well, i can't wait. carlton cuse: we're blasting long here today folks and not gonna take a lot of your precious time. and we're gonna go right to? damon lindelof: i wouldn't really use the word \"blasting\". carlton cuse: questions! damon lindelof: all right, carlton, you're wannago first, you obvious are very excited. carlton cuse: i am very excited! damon lindelof: ok, go for it. who is this from? carlton cuse: ok. there is a sort of a theme to my questions today and this is from mostly from canadians and this is from red deer in alberta, canada. \"which cast member of lost would you like to see become a successful cast member of the show\" dancing with the stars \"?\" damon lindelof: wow! hmm! wow! that is an question! i think the obvious answer here is hurley. carlton cuse: did you see the steve wozniak is gonna be on \"dancing with the stars\" this season? damon lindelof: no i didn't see that. what did they pay you? what did they pay you to plug \"dancing with the stars\" ? carlton cuse: nothing! damon lindelof: i did not see that but i will be tuning in because? carlton cuse: lawrence taylor and woz going head to head? come on. damon lindelof: that's unbelievable. you're not really interested in how i would answer this question. you just were like \"oh, here is my opportunity to make?\" carlton cuse: no, no, no! hurley, please! please, tell me why hurley? damon lindelof: i would like to see jorge because i believe he could win \"dancing with the stars\". and i've seen jorge's moves and they are impressive to say the least. and that would be my guess. well, i can't wait to see what the emergent theme of your questions, carlton. i have some suspicions they're all involve you getting paid by abc for plugging their shows. my question is from todd b. in ann arbor, michigan. carlton cuse: uhhh! home of the dharma initiative? damon lindelof: that is my understanding. \"in the episode\" jughead \"when desmond finds theresa after talking to janitor in oxford. is theresa in the same kind of time trance as eloise the rat or george minkowski from the freighter?\" this is a serious question, carlton, because we often? carlton cuse: i would say that's a very perceptive observation, i mean, clearly, we kind of have some information from \"the constant\". there was some research going on with faraday that involved other subjects and it's entirely plausible that his friend theresa might have been someone who he tried to do little consciousness travelling with. and things didn't work out too well. damon lindelof: i really hope we'll see theresa again because i'd like to know the answer to this question. carlton cuse: well, i think you might! that's exciting. damon lindelof: you heard it here first folks. carlton cuse: right, damon, here we go. damon lindelof: all right, you ask your silly questions and i'll ask the questions people want answered. carlton cuse: \"hi damon and carlton\" , this is good. you answer canadian questions, right? \"the\" oceanic 6 \"needs to take <mark>john locke</mark>'s body back with them to the island. oceanic 815 also had a body on board christian shephard. so, my question is\" what's christian shephard's body in any way a factor in the 815 making it to the island? and if <mark>locke</mark> might not be gone for good, as ben suggested, is resurrection of a sort possible for christian? \"i know you guys said definitively that he was dead, but is he more than just an image that island is using to communicate?\" damon lindelof: well, i'm afraid we don't answer canadian questions. (carlton and kris are laughing) but that was really well thought out to? just nothing against canada, there are many wonderful people there, but we don't answer. well, in all seriousness, i think that this is an excellent question and in next episode \"316\" you might find someone is talking about <mark>john locke</mark>'s body in relation to christian shephard's body and the word \"proxy\" might be mentioned. that's your word for the day - \"proxy\". (carlton and damon are pronouncing word \"proxy\" simultaneously) carlton cuse: awesome. ok. damon lindelof: all right, carlton. i said only straight serious questions. this is one that i'd never been ask before and i think jae dally from chicago, illinois wants to know and this is one that i know you can answer. \"what happened to bpo bpo, sun's dog? was the dog put in a kennel before sun and jin got on flight 815? if so, did sun pick up bpo bpo after getting back from the island?\" carlton cuse: good god? bpo bpo is with libby and kate's plane and they're having their own spin off series. damon lindelof: well, there you go. coming soon on abc? carlton cuse: bpo bpo? i am just gonna say right now bpo bpo might be one of those mysteries that just doesn't get answered by the end of year 6. damon lindelof: bpo bpo is right there at the top of mysteries that we don't think are mysteries. of which there will be many hounding us at the end of the show. carlton cuse: oh! hounding us? damon lindelof: oh, good god! next question. final question, carlton. you have a final one then i have a final. carlton cuse: all right. this is sticking with my theme, this is from jessy in toronto, ontario. \"hey, guys!\" one of your loyal canadian fans here, damon. \"just had a question from season 4 episode\" the other woman'. during that therapy session with juliet and harper harper mentions that juliet looks like her. i was wondering if this was a reference to either ben's mother or ben's childhood friend annie both of whom share resemblance with juliet. thanks. \"damon lindelof: that's a very insightful question and i think hopefully you'll be getting the answer before the series is over but you're asking exactly the right question. my therapy says that basically your mother is the only one who counts in so you keep sort of trying to replicate that through your life. carlton cuse: ok. damon lindelof:\" dear sneaky executive producers! you are so busted! \"says stacey je from raleigh, north carolina .\" i'm not sure where all that zombie talk originated but you guys have known all along that season 5 would in fact be the zombie season. jin and danielle raised from the dead, jin's lips even look to little zombiesh when they pull him to shore, could have been the sun and salt water, but my money is on zombie. and i have no doubt that once <mark>locke</mark> is brought back to the island he will also take zombie form and live again. what's next? nikki and paulo up from their graves? that's it - no question. just wanted you to know that the jig was up, or is it gig? ok, that's my question - is it jig or gig? \"carlton cuse: (laughing) i think it's jig, i think a gig? i think it's jig. the jig is up like? i keep thinking of like some sort of you know old like warner brothers crime drama -\" the jig is up, damon \". damon lindelof: if you think about the origin of it\" the jig is up \". is this some sort of a dance thing just to go back to your? it's like basically everybody is kind of a dancing around and the guy says\" all right everybody, the jig is up! \"carlton cuse: the jig is up. it's for addition. hide the bottles. here we come with the tommy guns. damon lindelof: right. so i'm wannago with jig. carlton cuse: and i'm wannasay\" stacey, we're busted \". that's it. you have done it. people ask us all the time how the fan ever figure out the show, the answer is\" yes, stacey, you have \". season 5 is zombie season. damon lindelof: season 5 is in fact zombie season. carlton cuse: subversively hidden under the guise of time travel. damon lindelof: all righty, well, why even continue? great podcast. by great i mean mediocre. carlton cuse: i'm sorry we couldn't get to this question which is, you know\" damon and carlton, if you wrote star wars episodes 1 through 3 what major changes would you have made? \"damon lindelof: i'm glad that you didn't get to that question here day. carlton cuse: that's for another time. damon lindelof: yeah, let's start with the jar jar? star wars has own nikki and paulo. carlton cuse: all right, guys, well, thanks for checking us out this week. we will back to you very soon with another

keeping an extensive eye on them. he also offers matthew abaddon as a driver and introduces him to <mark>locke</mark>. sayid is seen helping to construct a school as part of a charity called build our world. <mark>locke</mark> approaches him and speaks with him, but sayid refuses to return. he explains that nadia, with whom he spent nine months, before her death. sayid questions if the only reason that <mark>locke</mark> wants to return to the island is because he has nowhere else to go. before leaving, <mark>locke</mark> tells sayid that he can be contacted under the name <mark>locke</mark> after three years of separation. abaddon stop opposite a school in uptown new york. while waiting, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to locate helen norwood for him. abaddon asks if she is an old girlfriend, a question to which <mark>locke</mark> doesn't reply. as the school bell rings, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to help him out of the car. a group of students leaves the school, and amongst them is? <mark>locke</mark> waves to walt, who promptly leaves his friends and crosses the street to talk to <mark>locke</mark>. <mark>locke</mark> asks why walt isn't surprised to see him, and walt explains that he'd been having dreams of <mark>locke</mark> in a suit on the island, surrounded by people who wanted to hurt him. <mark>locke</mark> says that it is good that they are just dreams, to which walt gives him a nervous and confused look. walt also asks about his father, whom he suspects of returning to the island after dropping out of contact for three years. <mark>locke</mark> says that the last he had heard of hurley in his wheelchair, hurley is seen drawing a picture of an egyptian sphinx. hurley, completely nonchalant, asks <mark>locke</mark> why he is in a wheelchair, to which <mark>locke</mark> replies that he fell down a hole. hurley asks him if this is how he died, assuming <mark>locke</mark> is dead as he has been having regular conversations with dead people. however, hurley asks a nurse if he is talking to a man in a wheelchair, and she confirms it, letting hurley believe <mark>locke</mark> is alive. he asks him how he got off the island, and <mark>locke</mark> attempts to persuade hurley to return to the island. the attempt fails when hurley sees matthew abaddon and panics, refusing to have any more to do with either of them, insisting that\" that guy is evil. \"hurley recounts how abaddon posed as an employee of oceanic airlines at santa rosa hospital. the island. <mark>locke</mark> is at kate's house, who refuses to return in spite of the consequences to those still on the island. kate tells <mark>locke</mark> that she believes the only reason he wanted to stay on the island was because he didn't love anybody. he disagrees, and talks about his relationship with helen which, didn't work out because he was\" angry and obsessed. \"kate sarcastically replies\" look how far you've come. \"ben. <mark>locke</mark> and abaddon are in a cemetery, before a stone memorializing? abaddon states that she died of a brain aneurysm. <mark>john</mark> laments that helen loved him and if he had stayed, they would have been together. abaddon states that it wouldn't change anything, she'd still be dead, but <mark>locke</mark> seems unconvinced. abaddon reasons that helen is where she is supposed to be and that <mark>locke</mark> is destined to end up on the island. <mark>locke</mark> questions whether he believes that everything is predetermined and that he doesn't have a choice; abaddon asks whether richard alpert's prediction that <mark>locke</mark> must die is predetermined or whether it's a choice. <mark>locke</mark>, confused, wonders aloud how it could possibly be his choice to die. as abaddon is loading <mark>john</mark>'s wheelchair into the car's trunk, he is shot three times by an unseen <mark>locke</mark>. he wakes up in a hospital bed, with a disheveled ben. as he helps <mark>locke</mark> down, ben tells <mark>locke</mark> he has too much work to do to die and suggests contacting sun. <mark>locke</mark> says he promised jin he wouldn't contact her, and shows ben the wedding ring jin gave him. ben is surprised that jin is alive. <mark>locke</mark> states that he knows what he must do next - he must contact a woman who lives in los angeles named daniel's map. daniel's map has mysteriously been augmented to include ilana then comes in and asks him if he's found anything, and he says no. when she presses him, he takes a flashlight out of the sack and tosses it to her, not mentioning the gun. she tells him that there is a man on the beach in a suit who was not on the plane. on the way back to the gravel path, the plane sits on the path at an angle, but is intact. when they arrive to the camp, they meet a following day, <mark>locke</mark> stands at the edge of the surf, gazing toward the main island. christian shephard's shoes lie on the sand nearby. ilana walks up to <mark>locke</mark> and introduces herself, and offers him a mango, which he muses may be the best mango he has ever tasted. <mark>locke</mark> inquires about two outrigger canoes which sit nearby on the shore. ilana says that the canoes were already there, and that there had been a third one, but ben as the man who killed him. later, <mark>locke</mark> visits caesar in the office in dharma initiative, whose logo appears on the document caesar is reading. caesar questions <mark>locke</mark>'s knowledge of this, and <mark>locke</mark> replies that he has been on the island before, for over 100 days. caesar, confused but curious, asks <mark>locke</mark> if he can explain what he witnessed on the plane, describing how he was sitting next to a heavyset man with curly hair who disappeared during the flash of light, and that other survivors of the crash also reported seeing passengers disappear. realizing from his description that caesar is talking about hurley, <mark>locke</mark> responds that he now has a better idea of how he came to be on the island. the people who disappeared are accounted for. caesar says that they are, other than those who were injured in the crash. he leads <mark>locke</mark> to a makeshift infirmary where the injured passengers are resting. <mark>locke</mark> moves between them, closely looking at each person. he seems

<mark>john locke</mark> told him that he was off the island. similarly, walt appeared to know <mark>locke</mark>'s alias of jeremy bentham. this is possibly a blooper/continuity error or a suggestion that <mark>locke</mark> may have visited them both a second time not shown in this episode. apart from the reused footage of <mark>locke</mark> turning the frozen wheel, this entire episode takes place off the island. the only real-time events take place on hydra island, while the rest is a flashback. abaddon's license plate is szu 766. this is not (as some have conjectured) a reference to sun tzu. rather, it is the same stock license plate used by marlon brando in the film don juan demarco. when <mark>john</mark> visits hurley in the santa rosa mental health institute, he is wearing a name
