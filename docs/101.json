Fourteen students from CodeRVA in Richmond and Chesterfield County traveled to Washington to witness the announcement, which is meant to expand access to computer science in schools. The money also aims to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities in computer science. \"This funding will jumpstart efforts to ensure every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of a well-rounded education,\" code.org, a national coding nonprofit funded by donations from the likes of Facebook and Microsoft, wrote in a statement. \"For advocates of increased access and diversity in CS, this is the culmination of years of momentum that began in classrooms, spread to entire school districts, and won the support of business leaders and elected officials globally .\" Got a news tip? Email tips and photos here. President Donald Trump signed the executive memorandum Monday afternoon. The memorandum directs the U.S. Department of Education to dedicate at least $200 million to computer science education while increasing the focus of computer science in K-12 classrooms, Axios reported. The announcement was originally scheduled for about two weeks ago, but was delayed by Hurricane Irma. Former President Barack Obama also pushed for computer science education with his Computer Science For All initiative, which called for $4 billion in funding for states. Congress didn't fund the initiative. The Richmond region's representation in Washington comes as computer science education in Richmond is on the rise. The four students at The White House from CodeRVA are in their first year at the new, experimental high school near The Diamond. The school, which has a staff of six and an enrollment of about 100, is focused on computer science and is experimental in nature with internships, year-round schooling and about a 50-50 split between online and face-to-face learning. The school also features a diverse population, with about 50 percent men and women, which is similar to the school's makeup of white students and minorities. Virginia became the first state in the U.S. to pass computer science education reform in 2016 where every student receives access to computer science education from K-12. CodeVA, a nonprofit based in Richmond that advocates for computer science across the commonwealth, helped create the legislation and was overjoyed by the news Monday. CodeVA is an affiliate partner of code.org. \"We're pleased to see the renewed commitment from the administration to computer science education. Virginia, which has the highest density of computer science jobs in the nation, has long been a national leader in making K-12 computer science education a priority,\" said Chris Dovi, the executive director of CodeVA, in a statement. \"Our governor and our General Assembly's commitment is clear by adding computer science as a core K-12 subject in out SOLs, and it's fitting that Virginia students are represented at the White House event .\" The Richmond-area students who went to the announcement were: Sean Reavis, Robious Middle School Samuel Raymond, James River High School Shalicia Pickett,

second-seeded fremd became the final mid-suburban league team to say goodbye to the boys soccer season wednesday night in libertyville. the vikings (17-3-2) were eliminated after suffering a 3-1 defeat to no. 7 highland park (14-5-4), which struck for 3 unanswered goals in a seven-minute span to extend a memorable postseason run for retiring head coach dave bene. advertisement highland park meets host and no. 1 seed libertyville for a sectional championship on saturday morning. \"i guess i have to continue pinching myself because of this team,\" said a humble bene, who will step aside following the season after 33 years at the helm. \"we appeared to be in trouble after a very good start by fremd, and later, when they scored so quickly after the break. but we had that stretch in the second half when we scored those three quick goals, one of them a highlight goal from eoin moore, which really got us going .\" the vikings began by putting the pressure on the giants, and spurred by the speed and pace of front-runners lorenzo savino, matt burkhardt and yusuke kanada, along with a strong wind at its back, the msl champs appeared to be just a touch or two away from getting into the back of the net during the first quarter-hour. \"we didn't manage the wind very well tonight, and we let it affect how we played and highland park didn't,\" said fremd coach steve keller. a long, well-struck free kick from alex bochat forced giants keeper <mark>aaron white</mark> into a save at 10 minutes. later, spencer filosa and savino worked a nice 1-2 combination to allow savino to get free in close, only to watch talented sweeper konrad kucharski track back and clear off the end line. \"that no. 2 (kucharski) is a load back there, and easily one of the most impressive players along the back that i've seen all year long,\" said keller. moments after the break, the vikings took lead, courtesy a well-played corner sent low on the floor by brian hindle from the near flag to filosa, who on the turn, fired a smash off of <mark>white</mark> and into the net. disaster struck for fremd seven minutes later when an innocent looking corner serve from noah bloch appeared to knuckle on fremd keeper scott sutarik and slip through the senior's gloves and into the 6-yard box, where kucharski slotted the equalizer. what happened two minutes later might have been the beginning of the end for the vikings. that's when eoin moore unleashed a blast from 30 yards that buried itself into the back of the net to give the giants the lead for good. \"that was an amazing goal from eoin, and one that a senior player like he came through to score for us,\" said bene. playing from behind for the first time in weeks, the vikings conceded a costly third goal when they failed to clear a loose ball. freshman francesco moore was only to happy to steer in a shot from 20 yards. \"i'll give our guys credit for not giving up when we went down 2 goals, but we were chasing a highland park team which was energized and feeling very good about things after that third goal,\" keller said. the vikings stepped up the tempo in search of cutting into the giants' lead, and nearly did so if not for a brilliant save by <mark>white</mark>, who in full stretch to his left somehow stopped a shot by hindle at point-blank range. the giants dropped numbers, while fremd added another striker up top. and although it was one-way traffic heading in the direction of <mark>white</mark> and company, the vikings were not able to score again. custom reprints are a powerful and strategic way to share your

Yves Logghe/AP hide caption toggle caption Yves Logghe/AP <mark>David O'Sullivan</mark>, who heads the EU Mission to Washington, D.C., speaks in Brussels in February 2014. Yves Logghe/AP A European Union legislative group has sent a letter of protest to members of the U.S. Congress blasting\" the increasingly harmful approach from the White House \"to relations across the Atlantic. The letter came after news reports revealed that the State Department had quietly downgraded the status of the EU's Mission to the U.S., making it an international organization, rather than a national delegation. The EU's ambassador in Washington, <mark>David O'Sullivan</mark>, was not notified of the change in status, but he did notice that he hadn't been invited to certain affairs in recent weeks, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports. It became apparent at the state funeral of the late President George H.W. Bush in December 2018. Prior to the change, <mark>O'Sullivan</mark> would have been among the first 20 or 30 ambassadors to be called up, in line with his seniority as a diplomat serving since 2014. DW reports he was called up last .\" This is no way to treat partners, \"the letter notes .\" Such moves play into the hands of rival global powers and can only lead to greater fragmentation rather than much needed increased cooperation. \"National Security\" They Conveniently Forgot To Notify Us': EU Diplomat Downgraded In D.C.. The letter was signed by European Parliament members Christian Ehler of Germany, Jeppe Kofod of Denmark and Marietje Schaake of the Netherlands. They are the chair and two vice chairs, respectively, of the parliament's Delegation for Relations with the United States of America. \"We've seen a series of very, very confrontational and frankly insulting...approaches from the Trump administration,\" Schaake tells NPR. \"And now on top of that, the status of the EU delegation in Washington has suddenly been downgraded without the EU even being informed ....That really puts the EU last in line, behind all other countries. And I think it is absolutely necessary that the new Congress speaks out against this .\" Schaake says she has written to Congress on subjects such as net neutrality, but this is the first time the three delegation leaders have issued a joint appeal to U.S. lawmakers. She says the letter was sent to newly minted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif ., as well as every other member of Congress. Pelosi's office did not respond to NPR's request for an interview. The U.S. State Department also did not respond to requests for comment. Relations between the EU and the U.S. have been strained during President Trump's term in office. Europe Trump's Criticisms Of NATO Not Apparent As It Holds Largest War Games Since Cold War Brussels has bristled over U.S. tariffs on European exports, slapping retaliatory duties on American motorcycles, bourbon and other goods. The White House has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, which the EU remains committed to, and has announced that the U.S. plans to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. At a NATO summit in July 2018, Trump berated European countries for not spending more on their military defense--although the U.S. recently participated in the largest war games with NATO since the Cold War, as NPR has reported. Some European countries are trying to bolster ties with the U.S.. In October, Germany announced a year-long initiative called Wunderbar Together that will feature about 1,000 events in all 50 U.S. states. In launching the program, Germany appealed to the heavens--summoning a greeting from the first German commander of the International Space Station, Alexander Gerst, who said, \"A strong relationship between both sides of the Atlantic is fundamental for successful cooperation--be it on Earth or in space .\" Schaake of the European Parliament says she sees the relationship between her bloc and the U.S. as \"a relationship ending badly .\" \"The EU still believes we should stay together but the U.S. partner is, you know, maybe looking around elsewhere,\" she says. \"I wish the Trump administration could see that a strong transatlantic relationship is in the American self-interest .\" Ambassador <mark>O'Sullivan</mark> has not publicly commented on his downgraded status. His Twitter account still refers to him as the EU's ambassador to the United States, though technically the State Department now considers him the head of a delegation. Recently, <mark>O'Sullivan</mark> tweeted about how the U.S. is the largest supplier of soy beans to the EU. And he pointed to a report that his bloc is stable: \"Happy to note we are very much alive and kicking in 2019!\" NPR International Affairs Correspondent Jackie Northam contributed to this report.

[in] one of my first conversations with frank [darabont], we agreed that we wouldn't do the tv version of this. lori was not going to be some big busted, beautiful woman with flowing perfect hair who was standing by her man. we talked about doing the ugliest, dirtiest, most dangerous and sometimes unlikable version of this that we could. it was so exhilarating to be able to dig deep into the darkness of motherhood and the darkness of marriage...to work on a production that had the courage--even though some fans kicked up a fuss about it--to have the courage to say, \"we're going to tell this story a way it's never been told before' is remarkable. it's the best work i've ever done on camera, and that's because the material was so strong. it's an experience unlike anything i've ever had, and i've learned so much from it. i love lori so much. her passion, her fire, her lack of vanity...[laughs] i love that woman and i am going to miss her .\" how it almost didn't happen...sarah wayne callies: \"frank and i talked a lot about the necessity of lori dying, and we fought about it. glen [mazzara] and i talked about that scene a lot--what pieces had to be in place for lori, for carl and for rick. in a way it was an intimate process, because glen had lost his mother shortly before they started writing the season...the death of shane. the death of lori. those, to me, were very difficult things to get around. i had spoken to frank about that at a certain point and he goes,' i don't need to kill you .' and i said,\" due respect, sir, yes you do .'

But don't start cheering for the death of the Daily Mail just yet. A lawyer for Melania Trump said Monday he has informed several news organizations, including the Daily Mail, that they could face legal action for publishing articles that Trump contends were defamatory. (ERIC THAYER / The New York Times) ByHeather MallickColumnist Sat ., Aug. 27, 2016 The lawyer behind the Hulk Hogan sex-tape lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker is planning to sue Britain's Daily Mail on behalf of Melania Trump for repeating \"100 per cent false\" rumours that she worked as an escort in the 1990s. It was a story about those confused years when she was striving to reach American shores. It's a strange lawsuit because the lawyer, Charles Harder, who was backed by billionaire <mark>Peter Thiel</mark> in the Gawker case, said the Mail story \"exceeds all bounds of...human decency .\" Thanks to Trump's husband, I no longer know what those bounds are. Thrashingly, chaotically free speech leaves many orphans in its wake. The Daily Mail exceeds moral bounds often. After all those \"what we lost when we lost Gawker\" journalistic analyses--the answer is not a whole lot, frankly--I wonder what we'd lose in the Daily Mail were it to close, which I assume DMG Media will not permit. The thing is eternal; cockroaches will read it long after humans vanish. It's the only mainstream website I formally avoid as a health hazard--Twitter, you're next--but there remains something wonderful about it. Its genius is that it is unfailingly interesting (a quality that Canadian newspapers will evade unto death), I suspect because its editor, Paul Dacre, terrifies people. I get frightened all over again when I watch video of him at the 2012 Leveson inquiry into phone hacking. Dacre has said he \"would die in a ditch\" to defend a columnist's freedom of speech but as I typed his name, the knuckles vanished from my hands and appeared inside my fingers. The room grew cold; I could see my breath. The lead story on the Daily Mail's home page was a 30-kilometretraffic jam on the M5 motorway caused by police talking a suicidal woman off a bridge. So why did it take two hours to arrest her, the Mail headline asks angrily/chattily. Women. If they're not blocking traffic, they're a bloody smear on the public junctions, and take hours to clean up. Article Continued Below Oh no, they've sent columnist Katie Hopkins to the Calais \"Jungle\" migrant camp across the Channel in France. \"Calais is bandit country. Lawless. Ungodly .\" Note: partial sentences are every bad writer's spare change. They dispense them. One. By one. The Daily Mail offers the purest misogyny in existence, 4chan has nothing on them, and after two hours of study, dear readers, I've decided I don't like women much either. The Sidebar of Shame running down the right hand side contains one, two, oh 40 photos of us in action before I tired of counting because I am not aroused by strumpets who are all wrong for me. Action verbs flow: \"defends bikini body, puts on smoking hot display, flashes her pert derri\u00e8re, flaunts her toned torso, showcases her ace figure, shines in gold nightie top, dies, shows off her taut tummy, opts for sexy look, puts on a leggy display, flaunts her peachy posterior, cries, struggles to contain her womanly curves .\" Shift eyes back to the news and scroll down the longest tale of woe you will ever know, it's like a dragon's tail or the surgical packing in a deep wound. Britain's economy is \"booming\" while Germany's is \"wobbling .\" Nearly three out of 10 babies in England and Wales are born to foreign mothers, over 75 per cent in parts of London with \"Poles overtaking Indians .\" Note: never trust Daily Mail stats. If you're a foreigner, 100 per cent of infants born in your hospital room will be yours. It all depends how you define \"parts of London .\" Seven stories on bloody migrants. Five foreigners drown all at once, which is suspicious. A child reaches puberty at age 6, which is concerning. A mysterious \"rock\" on the surface of Mars looks like someone's \"lost shoe,\" and a take-no-chances bomb squad blows up a pesto sandwich on London Bridge. Here's photos of a python vomiting up an entire antelope. Daily Mail fear alert: rubble, pythons, shortage of bungalows, old cookies. Daily Mail advice: DO rub Vaseline on your teeth/split ends/behind ears as it gives skin \"a dewy glow .\" DON'T blacken eye walking into rolling stepladder outside Marks & Spencer as staff will laugh at you and \"fallout will shake your faith in the mainstay brand .\" DON'T get drunk and wake up to find you bought a & pound; 30,000 bus on eBay. In literary news, Sue Townsend dies and Gabriel Garcia Marquez is admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection (both died in 2014). Ask the Daily Mail doctor: Should I take turmeric pills for my arthritis? \"No .\" Daily Mail question: How long do YOU want to live for? The Daily Mail recipe is Freudian (sex, death), paranoia (bloody foreigners), disgusting personal ailments (people squeezing the unlikeliest things), wacky animals (mainly ferrets) and people who don't deserve nice things (foreigners). It's riveting. And that's the problem. Hours pass. Your head has gone nasty. I oppose censorship, sympathize with Melania Trump (imagine what the woman endures) and thanks to the Daily Mail, wish to insert myself into a large protective non-flammable glove away from the wider world.

(WHAS11)--A Louisville man is behind bars Tuesday after a deadly dispute with his landlord. Anthony Jecker, 54, is suspected in the shooting death of 49-year-old <mark>James Scott</mark> Tolle inside his Manor Brook Apartment complex in the Norfolk neighborhood. Tolle's father told WHAS 11 News his son had been in a dispute with Jecker over his electric bill, totaling $58. When Jecker didn't pay it, Tolle cut off his electricity. Tensions only escalated from there. \"The neighborhood is just really shocked. Everybody around here is just freaking out,\" neighbor Mary Welch said. \"I'm just having a real hard time grasping that my friend, that I talk to everyday, on a daily basis killed somebody .\" Tolle died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. \"Sixty dollars ain't worth killing somebody for. Take them to court,\" Welch said. Instead, Jecker appeared before a judge Tuesday morning on charges of murder and tampering with evidence, after police said he attempted to dispose of the gun. The judge set his bond at $25,000 cash only, on the conditions he not speak to Tolle's family or carry a firearm. Print print Email Email this article | Tweet MORE MORE!

It offers both fine detail and broad area coverage across a wider range of applications than any other pigment foil previously available from API. The PG grade is the result of two years research and development and combines the best qualities of the company's legacy pigment foils UA and 432, delivering a number of improved product features. A better opacity means customers will achieve a sharper colour and better overall finish and a wider operating temperature window increases productivity by improving process times. In addition, by providing a well-defined colour range in just a single grade, it is simpler for customers to choose their preferred product as PG will cover the vast majority of applications. Says <mark>Andy Kerr</mark>, International Technical Support: \"This new range has been developed to make product selection far easier for our customers. We have developed just one grade for most general-purpose applications, which is available in 12 well-defined colours .\" The versatility of PG across so many applications together with its improved technical capability, means the customer can concentrate on the effect they want to achieve rather than get involved in technical considerations. Having such a grade also means that deliveries will be quicker and simpler. \"Suitable for both fine detail and broad area coverage, PG can be used on a wide range of substrates including self-adhesive labels, coated and uncoated paper and board plus a wide range of plastics and natural materials such as leather and wood. In fact it can be used on anything from ballet shoes to brake pads .\" Working in collaboration with Newfoil, based in Bolton, API is launching the PG grade to platen press stamping label manufacturers in the UK. Commenting on PG after initial customer trials, Steve Tonge of Dotaprint Labels said: \"This foil makes label printing so much easier, one foil that suits all substrates and even works when printing foil on foil .\" Janet Clarkson, Director of Newfoil says; \"Initial customer trials have produced some truly exceptional results and as the leading hot foil distributor in the UK, we welcome a foil that not only delivers high performance, versatility and reliability, but also provides an easy machine set up .\" The new PG foils are available in a well defined range of colours and complement the comprehensive range of products that we already offer to the labeling industry. \"PG has an easy release and excellent adhesion. Depending on the machine type and application, it typically has activation at 85oC with an operating temperature of between 100oC to 1500C. For best results it has a recommended top temperature of 170oC. The new foil has good resistance to water, plasticiser migration and to wines and spirits. It is non-toxic and meets stringent compliance and legislation across numerous industry standards worldwide. Manufactured in Livingston, UK, PG is available worldwide through the company's dedicated distribution centres.

Taranaki's mayors are pushing for the next New Zealander of the Year to be from their region. Mayors Andrew Judd, New Plymouth, Ross Dunlop, South Taranaki, and Stratford district's Neil Volzke, have challenged residents to make the 2016 New Zealander of the Year a Taranaki local. Previous winners of the New Zealander of the Year Award include Sir Stephen Tindall (2015), Dr <mark>Lance O'Sullivan</mark> (2014), Sir <mark>Richard Taylor</mark> (2012) and Sir Ray Avery (2010). Taranaki has had few mentions in those other big awards, the Queen's biannual honours, in recent years, receiving just three in 2014. With 2.4 per cent of the population and approximately 350 honours handed out annually, on a per capita basis Taranaki could expect to receive about eight honours a year. This has been blamed on the region's rural heritage and an attitude of \"just getting on\" with things. The homegrown New Zealander of the Year is said to be the ultimate recognition of people's service to New Zealand. And the three mayors are out to find the winner in Taranaki. Mayors see ordinary people doing exceptional things in the community every day, Judd said. \"Whether it's the volunteer, high-achiever, or someone who went the extra mile to help others--these are real people displaying real acts of kindness. These people are the pillars of our community. They represent the best of us and make Taranaki a much better place to live in .\" There are plenty of people in Taranaki who would be deserving recipients of the New Zealander of the Year Award, he said. \"It's time we honoured their deeds by showing the rest of New Zealand just how proud we are of them .\" Any member of the public can nominate an individual or community organisation for an award. Nominations for the prestigious award, and supporting categories, opened last month and will close on the September 30. - Stuff Saved | Saved Stories Saved | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Next News story: Taranaki Iwi Trust to finalise $70m settlement with Crown Taranaki Daily News Homepage"}]
