<mark>lance armstrong</mark> for \"years of broken promises\" , the us government has joined a lawsuit alleging the doping cyclist defrauded former sponsor us postal service.<br/>the lawsuit was filed by floyd landis - a former <mark>armstrong</mark> teammate who was stripped of the 2006 tour de france crown for doping to which he admitted - alleging <mark>armstrong</mark> defrauded us taxpayers by claiming he was winning tour de france titles without taking performance-enhancing substances.<br/>\"<mark>lance armstrong</mark> and his cycling team took more than $30m from the us postal service based on their contractual promise to play fair and abide by the rules - including the rules against doping,\" ronald machen, us attorney for the district of columbia, said on friday.<br/>robert luskin, <mark>armstrong</mark> attorney, said in a statement that talks with federal lawyers collapsed over how to measure damages, with <mark>armstrong</mark>'s side saying the postal service reaped huge benefits from its cycling sponsor deal.<br/>sponsorship evaluations to support the claim, <mark>armstrong</mark>'s camp released sponsorship evaluations from 2001, 2002 and 2004 that attempted to place a monetary value on the exposure benefits to us postal at that time.<br/>there was no study to show any potential fallout in negative publicity from being attached to <mark>armstrong</mark>'s now-tainted era in the wake of his confession to being a dope cheat in a television interview with oprah winfrey last month.<br/><mark>armstrong</mark> was deprived of his tour de france titles last year after the us anti-doping agency (usada) uncovered overwhelming evidence, included testimony from 26 witnesses, that he was at the heart of a major doping conspiracy.<br/>also measured was the value of <mark>armstrong</mark>'s image with the us postal logo in such areas as magazine covers, television talk shows, commercials for other sponsors such as nike and other appearances and marketing opportunities.<br/>studies also recognised \"intangible benefits\" from <mark>armstrong</mark>'s popularity at the time, but noted \"there are no standards and the value lies with the individual corporation and their objectives\" ."}, {"articleID": "2019032921_00118500_W", "names": {"Subhash Chandra": ["Q21508195", "Q3630136", "Q37838865", "Q57334579"]}, "date": "2019-03-29", "url":

introduces him to <mark>locke</mark>.<br/><mark>locke</mark> approaches him and speaks with him, but sayid refuses to return.<br/>sayid questions if the only reason that <mark>locke</mark> wants to return to the island is because he has nowhere else to go.<br/>before leaving, <mark>locke</mark> tells sayid that he can be contacted under the name <mark>locke</mark> after three years of separation.<br/>while waiting, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to locate helen norwood for him.<br/>abaddon asks if she is an old girlfriend, a question to which <mark>locke</mark> doesn't reply.<br/>as the school bell rings, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to help him out of the car.<br/><mark>locke</mark> waves to walt, who promptly leaves his friends and crosses the street to talk to <mark>locke</mark>.<br/><mark>locke</mark> asks why walt isn't surprised to see him, and walt explains that he'd been having dreams of <mark>locke</mark> in a suit on the island, surrounded by people who wanted to hurt him.<br/><mark>locke</mark> says that it is good that they are just dreams, to which walt gives him a nervous and confused look.<br/><mark>locke</mark> says that the last he had heard of hurley in his wheelchair, hurley is seen drawing a picture of an egyptian sphinx.<br/>hurley, completely nonchalant, asks <mark>locke</mark> why he is in a wheelchair, to which <mark>locke</mark> replies that he fell down a hole.<br/>hurley asks him if this is how he died, assuming <mark>locke</mark> is dead as he has been having regular conversations with dead people.<br/>however, hurley asks a nurse if he is talking to a man in a wheelchair, and she confirms it, letting hurley believe <mark>locke</mark> is alive.<br/>he asks him how he got off the island, and <mark>locke</mark> attempts to persuade hurley to return to the island.<br/><mark>locke</mark> is at kate's house, who refuses to return in spite of the consequences to those still on the island.<br/>kate tells <mark>locke</mark> that she believes the only reason he wanted to stay on the island was because he didn't love anybody.<br/><mark>locke</mark> and abaddon are in a cemetery, before a stone memorializing?<br/><mark>john</mark> laments that helen loved him and if he had stayed, they would have been together.<br/>abaddon states that it wouldn't change anything, she'd still be dead, but <mark>locke</mark> seems unconvinced.<br/>abaddon reasons that helen is where she is supposed to be and that <mark>locke</mark> is destined to end up on the island.<br/><mark>locke</mark> questions whether he believes that everything is predetermined and that he doesn't have a choice; abaddon asks whether richard alpert's prediction that <mark>locke</mark> must die is predetermined or whether it's a choice.<br/><mark>locke</mark>, confused, wonders aloud how it could possibly be his choice to die.<br/>as abaddon is loading <mark>john</mark>'s wheelchair into the car's trunk, he is shot three times by an unseen <mark>locke</mark>.<br/>as he helps <mark>locke</mark> down, ben tells <mark>locke</mark> he has too much work to do to die and suggests contacting sun.<br/><mark>locke</mark> says he promised jin he wouldn't contact her, and shows ben the wedding ring jin gave him.<br/><mark>locke</mark> states that he knows what he must do next - he must contact a woman who lives in los angeles named daniel's map.<br/>when they arrive to the camp, they meet a following day, <mark>locke</mark> stands at the edge of the surf, gazing toward the main island.<br/>ilana walks up to <mark>locke</mark> and introduces herself, and offers him a mango, which he muses may be the best mango he has ever tasted.<br/><mark>locke</mark> inquires about two outrigger canoes which sit nearby on the shore.<br/>later, <mark>locke</mark> visits caesar in the office in dharma initiative, whose logo appears on the document caesar is reading.<br/>caesar questions <mark>locke</mark>'s knowledge of this, and <mark>locke</mark> replies that he has been on the island before, for over 100 days.<br/>caesar, confused but curious, asks <mark>locke</mark> if he can explain what he witnessed on the plane, describing how he was sitting next to a heavyset man with curly hair who disappeared during the flash of light, and that other survivors of the crash also reported seeing passengers disappear.<br/>realizing from his description that caesar is talking about hurley, <mark>locke</mark> responds that he now has a better idea of how he came to be on the island.<br/>he leads <mark>locke</mark> to a makeshift infirmary where the injured passengers are resting.<br/><mark>locke</mark> moves between them, closely looking at each person.<br/>he seems

<mark>David</mark> Thomlinson.<br/>A hush descended as mourners were asked to stand while on the screen an image appeared of <mark>David</mark>'s coffin being carried into the tiny Scaleby Church
