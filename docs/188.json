The platinum-selling country star will be honored at the red-carpet awards dinner on October 17 at Music City Center. This event will bring together both the business and music industries, combining two major driving forces behind the success of Music City. Kelsea Ballerini released her first album, \"The First Time,\" in 2015, which reached gold status. That same year, Ballerini received Billboard's Women in Music Rising Star award. In 2016, she was named New Female Vocalist of the Year at the ACM Awards. Ballerini has also been named one of CMT's \"Next Women of Country\" and the \"Nashville It Girl\" by Rolling Stone. Earlier this year, the ACM awarded Ballerini with the Gene Weed Milestone Award for her accomplishments in country music. Ballerini's sophomore album, \"Unapologetically,\" is set to drop Nov. 3, 2017. \"When you read the list of winners this year, you get a true sense of the impact that women are making in the Nashville music business - what a group, including the Artist of the Year, Kelsea Ballerini! Not only will we be showcasing what women are currently contributing, but also highlighting women from the past (and future) showing the longevity and importance of females in the business.\" - NBJ President and Publisher Kate Herman. The Nashville Business Journal is also pleased to name the program's first Lifetime Achievement winner: Jo Walker-Meador. Walker-Meador was born Edith Josephine Denning in Orlinda, Tenn.. She led the Country Music Association as executive director from 1962 until 1991, playing an integral part in the growth of the country music industry during that time. Under her leadership, the association grew from about 200 members to more than 7,000. She was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1995. Walker-Meador died this year on Aug. 16 after suffering a stroke. CMA CEO Sarah Trahern will be presenting the award at the event. Also new this year, the NBJ and Ryman are excited to present the first Lula Naff Ryman Trailblazer Award awarding an outstanding woman in music business history. In its inaugural year to kick off the award, the honor goes to Lula Naff, formerly with Ryman Auditorium. Naff took a job with a Johnson City talent agency after finishing business school. When the company moved to Nashville in 1904, Naff followed, soon thereafter she was put in charge of booking speaking engagements, concerts and other events for the newly renamed Ryman Auditorium. After years of commitment to the group, booking everyone from Katherine Hepburn to Harry Houdini, Naff retired in 1955 and was named Manager Emeritus. She passed away in 1960 at the age of 85. In addition to the presentation of the awards, The Harpeth Hall School Chamber Choir will perform a Kelsea Ballerini song as part of the awards dinner. Said Head of School Dr. Stephanie Balmer, \"It is an honor for Harpeth Hall's Chamber Choir to perform in a program that celebrates women in Nashville's music industry. The honorees are role models, and their paths exhibit the variety of ways our young women can make an impact. At Harpeth Hall School, we believe brave girls and purposeful women can change the world.\" To determine our list of Women in Music City winners, nominations were taken from the public, and the final of selection of honorees was judged by an independent panel of judges made up of the following: Lori Feldman (Warner Bros..

Va. resident Rich Rosendale, left, with the host of \"Recipe Rehab,\" Evette Rios, at the studios in Calabasas, Calif.. Rosendale, one of TV's newest celebrity chefs, says his greatest challenges come on the set of \"Recipe Rehab,\" a Saturday morning show that will begin airing Sept. 28 on CBS. MORGANTOWN, W. Va. - He's competed in the culinary Olympics, led a team at a global cooking competition in France and produced countless photo-worthy dishes for guests at southern West Virginia's world-class resort, The Greenbrier. But Richard Rosendale, one of TV's newest celebrity chefs, says his greatest challenges come on the set of \"Recipe Rehab,\" a Saturday morning show that begins airing Sept. 28 on CBS. On the show, families submit a favorite high-calorie recipe. Two chefs then compete to crank out healthier, lower-calorie versions - and make them easy for amateurs to duplicate. \"Some of the recipes taste really good, but they're laden with fat and sugar and sodium and calories,\" Rosendale said. \"Every recipe that was on the show, it was like,\" Yikes! This is going to be interesting .' \"Rosendale, U.S. captain for the international competition Bocuse d'Or in France earlier this year, faces off against California chef Vikki Krinsky throughout 11 episodes.\" Though I have a lot of competition experience, she's an expert in nutrition. And here I am cooking with butter, \"Rosendale said.\" But it was an even playing field. \"They shot four episodes a day, a pace requiring snap decisions on how to rehabilitate a meal. The importance of his work was never lost on Rosendale, a native of Uniontown, Pa., who worked in Pittsburgh before opening a restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. In 2009, the now-38-year-old father of two boys moved to Lewisburg in southern West Virginia - a state struggling with an obesity epidemic. In the 2011-12 school year, nearly 28 percent of fifth-graders screened by West Virginia University were considered obese. So are nearly one-third of West Virginia adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\" There are a lot of great cooking shows out there that are entertaining, \"Rosendale said.\" But if I can do something that's also going to serve a purpose, I want to do that. \"Nationwide, more than 23 million children and teenagers are considered overweight or obese, and Illinois-based Action for Healthy Kids says the numbers are\" trending in a scary direction. \"If childhood obesity isn't curbed, said spokesman <mark>Matthew Smith</mark>, 39 states can expect that more than 50 percent of their adult population will be obese by 2030. And studies show that children are more sedentary than ever, spending hours a day on TV, computers, tablets and phones.\" But TV can still pay a role and does play a role in education, \"<mark>Smith</mark> said.\" Any way we can get a message out that talks about healthy eating, about balanced eating, about active lifestyles...is a positive. \"Rosendale pointed out that many cooking shows focus on dishes beyond either the imagination or skill set of a typical TV viewer,\" So rather than come up with dishes that people probably aren't going to eat, \"he said,\" why not recreate what people are already eating? \"They can still enjoy spaghetti, for example. But\" Recipe Rehab \"explores how store-bought sauces are loaded with salt and how easy it is to make a fresher, better-tasting alternative. At the end of each episode, the chefs illustrate their techniques and offer tips. Rosendale resigned as The Greenbrier's executive chef and director of food and beverage in June to pursue other, unspecified opportunities. Now he acknowledges it was to do the show, which he hopes will continue after this season. Before he left the White Sulphur Springs resort, he launched the 44-acre Greenbrier Farm to produce vegetables for his kitchen. The certified master chef also oversaw the opening of five new restaurants and The Greenbrier Casino Club.\" Recipe Rehab \"- which used to air on ABC - is part of a new\" Dream Team \"programming block that CBS and Litton Entertainment announced last month. It also features\" <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark>'s 15-Minute Meals. \"<mark>Oliver</mark>, too, has a West Virginia connection: In 2010, he produced\" <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark>'s Food Revolution \"in Huntington after a report declared it America's fattest city. He created Huntington's Kitchen, leading classes that teach parents and children about unhealthy foods and healthy cooking. Today, the program is run by Cabell Huntington Hospital. Dr. <mark>Rachel Johnson</mark>, nutrition professor at the University of Vermont and spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, said TV is helpful in conveying a message and teaching skills, but what really counts is the example families set. Healthy food should be readily accessible, attractive and a normal part of the daily diet. Put baby carrots and apples right in front in the refrigerator, <mark>Johnson</mark> said, and a bowl of grapes on the counter. And keep at it. Research shows a child may reject a new food as many as 12 or 15 times. But <mark>Johnson</mark> said that if parents keep offering it, the child will eventually prefer it, whether it's skim milk or bananas.\" Don't give up. Don't force them, but have a rule: You have to taste it, \"she said.\" It is hard not to revert to the chicken nuggets, to the frozen pizza. I know. I'm a mom ....But over time, they will develop a preference for it. \"--Online: Recipe Rehab: http: //reciperehab.com/> Apps and services for tablet devices> Apps and services for your mobile phone> Get updates via Facebook and Twitter> Your daily paper delivered to your computer"}, {"articleID": "2010092523_00095125_W", "names": {"Charlie Brown": ["Q1066832", "Q16205577", "Q2960832", "Q5084600", "Q5084601", "Q5084602", "Q5084603", "Q5084605", "Q5084607", "Q5084609"], "Peter Barker": ["Q19871103", "Q21004971", "Q980633"], "Stan Lee": ["Q16194157", "Q181900", "Q7597756"]}, "date": "2010-09-25", "url": "http://muppet.wikia.com/index.php?title=Episode_606:_Comic_Capers&diff=544788&oldid=prev", "content": "the babies are disappointed when they finish reading the comics, but piggy says that they don't have to wait until next week for more--they can draw their own comics. she leads the babies in a song, \"[[the sunday funnies]]\" , as they gather their material and start to draw. they imagine lots of comic strips, including scooter as \"[[dick tracy]]\" . the babies are disappointed when they finish reading the comics, but piggy says that they don't have to wait until next week for more--they can draw their own comics. she leads the babies in a song, \"[[the sunday funnies]]\" , as they gather their material and start to draw. they imagine lots of comic strips, including scooter as \"[[dick tracy]]\" . scooter tries drawing \"[[blondie]]\" on his computer, but can't get the mailman to look right.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shuttered two of its labs as officials step back to investigate recent incidents and review overall safety procedure for handling dangerous pathogens. None of the mistakes caused any illnesses or deaths, thankfully. But experts say the lapses could have been deadly - even if the viruses didn't fall into the wrong hands. Smallpox What happened: Earlier this month, researchers were surprised to discover six vials of variola--the virus that causes smallpox--when cleaning out a cold storage room at NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. Since smallpox is considered a bioterrorism threat, only two labs in the world have stockpiles: One at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters and another at the VECTOR Institute in Russia. In other words, the virus should not have turned up in an old box in Bethesda. No one at the facility knew the smallpox vials were there, and the building was not equipped to handle viruses that require the most stringent safety and security measures like smallpox, anthrax and Ebola. Officials have since learned that two of the six vials still contained samples of live, infectious virus, which may date back to the 1950s. No one was infected, but officials are investigating the matter. What could have happened: Since the virus was alive in two of the vials, there was a chance it could have spread, experts say. \"The smallpox vials caused no harm sitting in a box,\" said ABC News' chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser. \"Had the box been crushed and the virus escaped, people in the immediate vicinity could have been infected.\" And since these people wouldn't have known that they were exposed to the virus, they might have spread it to others, said Dr. William Schaffner, chair of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"It would not have immediately been diagnosed,\" said Schaffner, explaining that most doctors have never seen smallpox, which was eradicated in 1979. \"So there would have been some opportunity for perhaps some limited spread around these people.\" People are no longer vaccinated for it and therefore don't have immunity, Besser said. Once health officials realized smallpox was at fault for the illnesses, however, they would begin vaccinating people who had been in contact with those who were infected. Another consequence of the lab blunder? Public panic. \"We would have immediately been worried about a bioterrorism event,\" said Schaffner. \"Given that this was in Washington, there would have been hullabaloo, eight-point headlines in The New York Times, The Washington Post.\" Anthrax What happened: At least 84 lab workers at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta were exposed to live anthrax spores in June, according to the CDC. The employees were not using proper safety guidelines for dealing with the lethal bacteria because the anthrax was supposed to have been \"inactivated\" and therefore not infectious, the agency said. It wasn't until the samples were gathered to be destroyed in an incinerator that researchers discovered the live bacteria. Since anthrax symptoms can take two months to appear, the exposed workers are being monitored and have been offered vaccines and antibiotics. The CDC is investigating the matter and the lab and hallways of the facility have been decontaminated. According to a congressional memo released last week, the anthrax was stored in an unlocked refrigerator in an unrestricted hallway. The memo also stated that disinfectants were expired, \"germ materials\" were transported between labs in Ziplock bags, and workers exposed to anthrax didn't get medical examinations until five days after knowledge of the exposure. What could have happened: The exposed workers could have inhaled the bacterium and become infected, Besser said. \"As many as 45 percent would have died, even if their illness had been recognized promptly and treated with the right antibiotics,\" he said. \"Untreated anthrax pneumonia is fatal in 85 percent of infected people.\" Since anthrax is not spread from person-to-person, it would not have caused a widespread outbreak. But the incident would have spread fear, according to Schaffner. Bird flu What happened: A CDC flu sample was accidentally contaminated with a deadly strain of bird flu and sent to a lab run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA discovered the contamination in May, but it wasn't reported to top management until last week, according to the Associated Press. What could have happened: Avian flu doesn't spread as easily as other strains of the virus, but close contacts of exposed workers would have been at risk, according to Schaffner, who added that the infection can be fatal. Besser was also concerned about the bird population. \"The strain of bird flu mistakenly sent to the USDA is highly lethal in birds,\" he said. \"Release of this strain into American poultry flocks could have been devastating to that industry.\" Had that happened, people who had close contact with sick birds could also have become infected flu strain, Besser said.

And for the first time, elementary school kids have a place to play. It's part of a project to help young people stay fit. They mixed cement, dug a mountain of mulch and did some heavy lifting all for a good cause, giving kids a safe place to play and a way to stay active, and they're doing it all in just a day. \"We started at 7 in the morning and we're here until probably 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\" said Jose Aquino, a volunteer from United Healthcare. Some Patriots players volunteered to help build a playground at a Foxboro School (WBZ-TV) The \"instant\" playground is a joint project between United Healthcare, a non-profit called Kaboom! and the New England Patriots at the Foxborough Regional Charter School. Pat Patriot chipped in, so did the cheerleaders and a handful of very burly players. But it was about 200 volunteers that really got it done. \"As part of a health care company we're helping people live healthier lives, and this is a chance to do that in a different way than we normally do,\" said Shane, one of the volunteers. \"Awesome to have a team willing to take the day off to move some mulch, lots of mulch!\" added Haya Alzaid. And now the elementary school here will have a playground. \"This is a big deal for us. We've been waiting for a couple of years to get a playground down here at our new elementary school building,\" said Christiana Benson, the school's principal. \"I think play is important for the kids, and this is a good volunteer opportunity and a good use of my time,\" said parent Rick Prescott.

Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and 10 other well-known companies joined the White House in launching the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a campaign that the White House said would inject US $140 billion in low-carbon investments into the global economy. Massive private sector commitments are seen by participants as essential to getting a global agreement on climate change in Paris in December. Emerging nations have demanded that any agreement include tens of billions of dollars in financing from developed nations to help their economies adapt to a low-carbon future. Although not all the corporate pledges represented new commitments, Monday's announcement showed the administration's ability to get private sector buy-in for international climate change financing. Mindy Lubber, president of environmental investor group Ceres, applauded the announcements but said the White House cannot rely solely on these pledges. \"Voluntary commitments alone will not get us the meaningful reductions we need,\" she said. \"Strong carbon-reducing policies are hugely important.\" None of the companies involved in Monday's announcement were from the fossil fuel sector of the economy, though the White House said there could be a second round of pledges in the fall ahead of the Paris conference. Other companies included General Motors, Bank of America, Microsoft and Coca Cola, many of which also announced measures to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions and deploy more clean energy. The White House said the companies' promises would lead to at least 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy being brought on line. Water-use intensity would be reduced by 15 percent and the companies would target zero net deforestation in their supply chains. Google, which claims to be the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power globally, pledged to triple those purchases over the next decade. In a blog post on Google's website, CEO <mark>Eric Schmidt</mark> said while the private sector can play a leadership role on climate change, it needs political certainty to encourage companies to scale up their investments. \"We need the world's political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term,\" <mark>Schmidt</mark> wrote. Among other elements of the plan, Apple, one of the 13 companies, pledged to bring nearly 300 MW of renewable energy online in five states and the Sichuan province in China. Berkshire Hathaway said it will retire 75 percent of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. Soft-drink manufacturers Coca Cola and Pepsi Co. vowed to reduce the carbon footprint of their businesses: Pepsi pledging to expand its sustainable farming initiative for its supply chain, and Coca Cola saying it would reduce the carbon footprint of the \"drink in your hand\" by 25 percent by 2020. Obama needs voluntary private sector participation because the Republican-controlled Congress, which has power over public financing, appears reluctant to authorize extensive spending on renewable energy investments. Secretary of State <mark>John Kerry</mark> is scheduled to host an event at the State Department on October 20-21 to \"highlight American leadership in climate investment and innovative solutions to our toughest climate finance challenges.\" (Reporting By Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Bruce Wallace) - Reuters"}]
