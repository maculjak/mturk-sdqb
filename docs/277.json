The formal trials are aimed at finding how driverless cars could be integrated into everyday life across the country, in order to better understand how driverless technology will interact with people. The UK Government has already funded \u00a3 10m for the driverless cars competition and has the announced an additional \u00a3 9m to help the cities implement the initiative. Bristol is planning to form a consortium, which is aimed at knowing how driverless cars can make roads safer and reduce congestion. Greenwich is expected to run the Gateway scheme which will test automated passenger shuttle vehicles and autonomous valet parking for adapted cars. Milton Keynes and Coventry will be working together on the UK Autodrive programme, which is aimed at developing technologies for integration into existing roads and the surrounding infrastructure to facilitate vehicle navigation.

At a security conference in Manama, Bahrain, U.K. Foreign Secretary <mark>Philip Hammond</mark> signed the deal, which would expand the Mina Salman Port in Bahrain, adding aircraft carriers and destroyers to four British minesweepers already located at the facility. \"This new base is a permanent expansion of the Royal Navy's footprint and will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability in the Gulf,\" U.K. Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said. Since September Britain has conducted airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq as part of a U.S.-led coalition that includes Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and Netherlands. The new base would support such operations as well as those against piracy in the region. It will also be the first permanent British military facility to be located in the Middle East since a 1968 decision to close all U.K. bases east of the Suez Canal by 1971. The expansion of facilities at the Mina Salman Port is slated to cost $23 million, most of which will be paid by Bahrain, with Britain shouldering ongoing costs.

The League Two side bossed the opening half-hour and took the lead through Jonathan Franks. But once Turnbull equalised in the 56th minute there was only one team in it - even if it did take until the 90th minute for Jarrett Rivers to confirm his side's place in tomorrow's third-round draw. And Turnbull admitted he had not been on that sort of form on the training ground. \"I'd been practising them all week in training and couldn't hit a barn door,\" said Turnbull, who started his career at Victoria Park. \"I said to Robbie Dale,\" I'm going to hit this \". Never in my dreams did I think I'd catch it like I did .\" It didn't just go in the top corner, it curled into the side-netting. \"Afterwards, our manager <mark>Tom Wade</mark> said that Alan Shearer (working for BBC television on the night) said it was the best free-kick he'd ever seen. Wow. That's good enough for me .\" Turnbull also set up the winner, releasing Rivers for the fairytale finish which sparked a bench clearance and a pitch invasion. \"I gave him (Rivers) the ball, it was a good pass, and I just thought,\" Go on, run at them', \"said Turnbull, part of the Bury team expelled from the competition for fielding an ineligible player in 2006 .\" Unbelievable. It was just incredible. \"I can't wait for tomorrow's draw - at least I know we'll definitely be playing in it this time .\" After the game <mark>Wade</mark> was keen to stress Turnbull's contribution went way beyond the pitch. \"<mark>Stephen</mark> and Phil Turnbull are probably two of the best midfield players around the area,\" he said. \"<mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>'s just a great lad. He's got great ability and he's great in the changing room because he gets the young lads playing and gives them confidence .\" It was a fantastic goal but his overall play was fantastic. \"You saw the bench go up when the goals went in and even the lads who weren't stripped. I think that's the difference .\" We're a very, very close team and a close changing room. \"Blyth's win was extra sweet for Nathan Buddle.

That's according to a report by an independent watchdog agency, The report, issued by the VA Inspector General (IG) found that more than 21,000 homeless veterans in fiscal year 2013 weren't able to contact VA counselors and 3,000 were not referred to a VA medical facility, even when they provided all of the necessary information. Rather than providing a human voice, the call center relied on answering machines instead of counselors, and the VA IG added that it \"could not account for a significant amount of the counselors' time,\" the Beacon reports. The report noted that counselors spent large amounts of time unavailable to answer calls during peak call times. This resulted in 40,500 missed opportunities where the call center either didn't refer the veterans' calls to medical facilities, or it closed referrals without making certain that homeless veterans received the services they needed from VA medical facilities, Fox News reports. \"In our opinion, the majority of these calls could have been answered by counselors, instead of the answering machine,\" the report stated. It also said that 85 percent of the records reviewed by the IG lacked documentation to show that the veterans had received the support services they needed, The report also found that counselors working at the center \"often did not log in or did not spend the entire day logged into the call center telephone system .\" But the report is merely a drop in the bucket for what has been a terrible year for the VA, long mired in controversy after several other reports showed mistreatment of veterans--including hidden wait lists--at VA hospitals nationwide. The influx of reports resulted in the resignation of former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, who started the Zero Homelessness Initiative in 2009. New VA Secretary <mark>Robert McDonald</mark> is following up with this, and the goal is to completely eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015, The Fiscal Times reports. It's estimated that on any given night, some 49,993 vets are homeless, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reports, according to About 12,700 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn were homeless in 2010. The number of young homeless veterans is on the rise, although they only constitute 8.8 percent of the overall population of homeless vets. \u2022 The Interim Under Secretary for Health should stop the use of answering machines and make counselors more useful and accessible to the National Call Center before hiring extra staff. \u2022 The IG recommended that the Under Secretary implement effective performance measures and criteria for the call center and performance measures for staff to improve the accessibility of counselors, efficient management of calls, as well as making certain that calls are referred properly. \u2022 The Under Secretary should monitor and analyze calls routinely to assess the quality of call center support services, including counselor accessibility, efficiency in answering calls, and the issuance of referrals. \u2022 The IG recommended the Under Secretary install management controls so that VA medical facilities receive feedback on the quality of referral responses and on necessary corrections and improvements to the support services being offered to homeless veterans.

It was enough to prompt a high-five between Pope Francis and evangelical pastor <mark>James Robison</mark>. Of course, do we really need reminding that male and female are different? Absolutely, especially with the advent of same-sex marriage, which is prompting assertions that it \"doesn't matter\" whether two men or two women parent a household. Ask any parent if males and females are different. My wife and I have eight children under our roof, and the boy-girl differences are dramatic. Here's a typical Saturday morning exchange at our house: \"Daddy!\" my 7-year-old son yells, running toward me in camouflage hunting clothes. \"I had a dream last night that I stabbed Bigfoot nine times with a spear!\" Not missing a beat, his 3-year-old sister prances and dances toward me in a flowered pink dress: \"Daddy, I had a dream about a ladybug!\" The 3-year-old goes by \"Princess Cupcake .\" She's of the age where she dresses up and displays herself in front of me waiting for me to gush, \"Wow, you look like a princess!\" She beams. Her older sisters did the same thing. The first time I said that to her oldest sister, she calmly glowed to her mom, \"He said I look like a princess .\" Needless to say, the boys have never done that-not once in 20,000-plus days of combined lives. My wife and I have nothing to do with these differences, other than providing the chromosomes. My 7-year-old boy, long before fancying himself a Bigfoot slayer, declared himself \"Wolfboy .\" My wife and I certainly didn't come up with that one. She will tell you that she did not give birth to a wolf boy. No, it was he alone who transmogrified himself into this half beast, half boy. Wolfboy sauntered around the house creeping, preying. We attempted to keep these wild manifestations at, shall we say, bay-a more restrained Wolfboy. One day at the home of friends, he politely asked my wife if he could go outside to \"howl,\" to the giggles of my friend's teenage girl. Fortunately, the Wolfboy thing eventually cooled. One afternoon, he grabbed two chopsticks for fangs, shoving them into his throat. Wolfboy had to be taken to the hospital. We've since had several full moons with no reappearances. That brings me back to the differences in the sexes. These traits follow us into adulthood, marriage, and parenting. There are things my wife does that I just can't. She happily jumps up in the middle of the night at the slightest cry. I lay there groaning. On the flip side, she has no yearning to take the teenage boys hunting in 20-degree weather with rifles and crossbows to shoot and gut and hang and skin and butcher a deer. My boys crave that, and they're utterly mystified at their sisters' insatiable interest in the Duggar family's weddings. In short, all of this is obvious, observable. Really, to deny it is to be warped by ideology, culture, politics, or some agenda. That brings me back to the ecumenical gathering at the Vatican, where these gender differences in married and family life were acknowledged and celebrated. \"The biggest threat to marriage is that people have forgotten its purpose,\" said Pastor Rick Warren, the 28th speaker at the conference. \"Children who grow up with the presence of a mother and father are more successful in life, are healthier, are stronger, are less likely to be involved in crime, are less likely to go to prison, are less likely to be involved in drug abuse, are less likely to live in poverty. If you really want to support children, we need to support two-parent families, a husband and a wife, a mom and a dad .\" The bishop of Rome didn't disagree with the Saddleback Church pastor. \"Children have a right to grow up in a family with a father and a mother,\" said Pope Francis. Such households are best \"capable of creating a suitable environment for the child's development and emotional maturity .\" Of course, not all children get that ideal; but it's an ideal our culture should strive for rather than against. We were made male and female; and from birth to death and childhood to parenthood, those differences have a distinct and complementary purpose.

Originally released in 1993 and 1994, respectively, these two compilations will be re-released back into the physical market in compact and sleek new packaging. Each set includes full-color booklets with in-depth essays by Stax historian and compilations co-producer <mark>Rob Bowman</mark>. The volumes feature stalwart Stax R & B artists including Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers, Rufus <mark>Thomas</mark>, Johnnie Taylor, <mark>Carla Thomas</mark>, the Bar-Kays and <mark>William Bell</mark>, as well as bluesmen Little Milton, <mark>Albert King</mark> and Little Sonny, and \"second generation\" Stax hitmakers like Jean Knight, the Soul Children, <mark>Kim Weston</mark>, the Temprees, and Mel & Tim. Many of the tracks included in these collections will be made available digitally for the very first time. The story of the great Memphis soul label Stax/Volt can be divided into two distinct eras: the period from 1959 through the beginning of 1968, when the company was distributed by Atlantic and was developing its influential sound and image (chronicled in acclaimed 9-CD box set The Complete Stax/Volt Singles 1959-1968, released by Atlantic in 1991); and the post-Atlantic years, from May 1968 through the end of 1975, when Stax/Volt began its transition from a small, down-home enterprise to a corporate soul powerhouse. In Stax's early years as an independent label, founders <mark>Jim Stewart</mark> and Estelle Axton struggled with the loss of its back catalog to Atlantic/Warner Brothers Records and the loss of the label's most lucrative artist, Otis Redding, who tragically died in a plane crash months before. In need of funding and new stars, Axton and <mark>Stewart</mark> sold the label to Gulf + Western, bringing on promotion head Al Bell (who would soon become an equal partner and major figurehead of the label). In his Vol. 2 essay, <mark>Rob Bowman</mark> recalls, \"As the sun arose in Memphis on May 6, 1968 [the day Stax officially became independent of Atlantic], Stax had been essentially gutted. For all intents and purposes it was a new record company poised to issue its first few records .\" Comprised of nine CDs, Vol. 2 focuses on this period, 1968 through 1971, when Stax/Volt was forging ahead as its own entity. The 216-song collection includes all of the singles issued by the label during this time period, and features some of the biggest and best-loved hits of the day, including Isaac Hayes' Theme From Shaft, The Staple Singers' Respect Yourself and Johnnie Taylor's Who's Making Love, as well as a number of little-known gems by both major and less-familiar artists. By the end of 1971, <mark>Bowman</mark> notes, \"Al Bell's dream of [Stax/Volt] becoming a diversified full-line record company was several steps further along the line to being reality. The label now recorded a wealth of different styles and flavors of black popular music, ranging from the jazz and easy-listening proclivities of Isaac Hayes to the blues of Little Milton to the '70s disco-infused vocal style of the Dramatics to the gutsy soul of the Staple Singers .\" Indeed, the early 1970s found Stax/Volt a much bigger entity than ever thought possible during its initial split from Atlantic, with Isaac Hayes as its breakout star. Spurred by the success of Hayes' GRAMMY Award-Winning Shaft soundtrack in early 1972, the label was casting its net across a wide cross section of the entertainment industry, entering into new territory with soundtracks, comedy records, and even investing in a Broadway play. The Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 3: 1972-1975, coming Spring 2015, covers this era of success and excess, when Stax's stars were shining bright, but the label was on the verge of its dramatic denouement. The 10-disc box set contains all 213 soul singles issued by Stax/Volt during this time, including such hits as <mark>Shirley Brown</mark>'s Woman to Woman and the Staple Singers' I'll Take You There. In 1976, faced with involuntary bankruptcy and an unsuccessful distribution deal with CBS Records, Stax was forced to close its doors. In his liner notes for Vol. 3, compilation co-producer Bill Belmont writes, \"Stax's difficult and inglorious end in no way diminishes its vital contributions to rhythm and blues and soul. Today, the music of Stax maintains a strong and steady presence, heard continually in cover versions by major artists, in movies and on television. Simply put, the Memphis Sound lives .\" And indeed it does. With a revival of the label in recent years, through Fantasy Records, the 2003 opening of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, Tenn., as well as several developing theatrical performances around the label, the music of Stax will continue to influence generations of musicians and fans alike .----------------------------------------------Never miss a story!
