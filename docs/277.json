Overseas consumers' taste for New Zealand wine has lifted exports to just under $1.6 billion for the last year, up 10 per cent on the year before. The United States market jumped by 23 per cent, from $372 million in 2015 to $460m to the end of June 2016. Other leading export destinations include the United Kingdom ($381m), Australia ($361m), Canada ($107m), and the Netherlands ($44m). China, which has grown from practically nothing 10 years ago, is now worth $27.5 m, although it slipped in value slightly from the year before. Hong Kong, regarded as a separate market, recorded $17m in exports. New Zealand Winegrowers chairman <mark>Steve Green</mark> said this year marked the 21st in a row that wine exports had grown, and the industry was on target to reach its goal of $2b by 2020. \"This continued strong performance is testament to underlying market and consumer demand for our wines in key markets,\" <mark>Green</mark> said. Export volumes are expected to rise by a further 10 per cent over the next 12 months, following the 2016 grape harvest of 436,000 tonnes, 34 per cent higher than last year. By volume of variety, sauvignon blanc is by far the leader at 303,000 tonnes, followed by pinot noir (35,000 tonnes), chardonnay (29,000 tonnes), pinot gris (25,000 tonnes), and merlot (9000 tonnes). The total vineyard area is 36,000 hectares, predicted to grow to about 40,000 ha over the next four years. Wine is now New Zealand's sixth largest export good by value.

Seuss and the Lee factor In all the fuss about the publication of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman, it might be forgotten there is another literary giant who has a forgotten book coming out this month in the US. Dr Seuss' What Pet Should I Get? is published on July 28 and while it is not necessarily going to affect the moral standing of characters such as the Cat in the Hat or the Grinch, Random House has ordered a print run of 1 million copies. That doesn't quite match the 1.1 million copies of Watchman sold in the US in the first six days after publication last week. But it's still an event, even if old but unseen manuscripts by Dr Seuss--real name Theodor Geisel--keep popping up; this one was found by his widow, Audrey. To match the occasion, New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani produced her review in rhyme to match that of Dr Seuss. \"Seuss never spoke down to his readers, no matter how small. / His tales were told with vim, vigour and zest. / What Pet Should I Get? entertains us just fine. / Who cares if this book's not really his best?\" Doing evil on a Wednesday When philosopher Raimond Gaita heard Prime Minister <mark>Tony Abbott</mark> describe one of the Islamic State beheadings as pure evil, it set him thinking about how politicians use the term evil and what effect it has. People feel uneasy \"because they believe the use of the term betrays moral simplification and a desire to demonise those who are accused of being or having done evil\". But scepticism, he argues, about the use of such terms does not inevitably mean scepticism about the need for moral judgment in politics. And so Gaita arrived at the theme for his annual Wednesday lectures, beginning July 29, which will be run for the next six weeks in the public lecture theatre of the Old Arts Building at the University of Melbourne. Among the speakers are Gaita himself on \"Politics and the Idea of Evil\" , Anne Manne on \"The Anders Breivik Massacre: The Psychology of Evil\" , and Timothy Lynch on \"Good and Evil in American Politics\".
