(ap photo) free agency is over for <mark>richards</mark>, but if he thought this process was tough, wait until he sees what's next. he's now been identified as the variable that takes the rangers from an early-round exit to a championship team. now, it's on him to make it happen. when the rangers were eliminated from the playoffs, coach john tortorella sat down and identified a few needs to get over the hump. an elite center. someone to run the power play. a mentor for the rangers' young developing forwards. <mark>richards</mark> addresses all three, and that's why the rangers and <mark>richards</mark> were the ideal fit compared to the other finalists like the toronto maple leafs, los angeles kings, calgary flames and tampa bay lightning. he can take the rangers from good to great. he addresses real needs, which wasn't necessarily the case in tampa bay or los angeles. it's the perfect fit--assuming he's able to withstand the responsibility. he's playing in a market unlike any other he's played in his career with a pressure he's never faced. this isn't dallas or tampa. this is new york, and the expectation has now become a stanley cup. \"it's going to be a challenge for sure. it's going to be something different, i haven't experienced it,\" he said of the move to a market like new york. \"you want to be a great player, that's something you should relish .\" read: how

credit for landing the best player in free agency, at a time his young, developing team is ready for it. he also gets points for the way he did it. he passed on going to the newport offices in mississauga, ont., with a convoy of people to try and win over the <mark>richards</mark> camp. instead, he made a phone call at 12:01 p.m. et on friday where he made his pitch and first offer. then he watched on television as other teams paraded through the newport office. it couldn't have been easy waiting and knowing convincing pros like kings gm dean lombardi and lightning gm steve yzerman were making a pitch. but the laid-back approach worked. \"i just didn't want it to turn into some kind of scene,\" sather said. \"i just didn't want to get involved in that kind of circus arrangement? we made our presentation and we were straight up .\" on paper, it's perfect. <mark>richards</mark> fills multiple needs. he knows and likes the coach. he says he feels great and fully recovered from his concussion and has been training for six weeks. new york needed an elite center, and he was the only one available. the free agency circus is over for <mark>richards</mark> but the spotlight doesn't disappear because his name is on a contract. he chose new york, and he'd better be prepared for what that means. \"what better place to try to perform than madison square garden every night,\" he said. \"that's a dream come true .\" if he can stand the pressure, brad richards a great fit for new york rangers saturday jul 2 for brad richards, the free agency circus is over, but the scrutiny has
