And town MP <mark>David Wright</mark>, who left in 1983, and Joyce Rowding, who started in 1936, were two of the star guests. The school in New Road opened in 1933 and has steadily grown in size over the years, with more than 600 pupils now on the roll. Telford MP Mr <mark>Wright</mark>, who was born and raised in the town, said he was delighted at being invited to cut the anniversary cake. He said: \"I am so glad to be back celebrating the 80th anniversary of my school. I left in 1983 and today really has brought the memories flooding back .\" It is great to see so many people who have attended the school over the years coming back for the anniversary to share their memories. \"Great-grandmother Mrs Rowding, now of Donnington, admitted Saturday had been the first time she had returned to the school since she attended there in the 1930s .\" It is the first time I have been back and I couldn't believe it. I hardly recognise the place, so much has changed, \"she said .\" My children and their children also attended here, so three generations of my family have passed through the doors over the years. \"Widow Mrs Rowding, who has five children, 17 grandchildren and\" at least as many \"great-grandchildren, helped out on the Home Front in various factories during the Second World War after leaving school before going on to work as a home help. Headteacher <mark>John Jones</mark> said it was especially important to celebrate the anniversary with the historic school buildings due to be bulldozed in the next couple of years as part of a? 200 million improvement programme across the borough. Pupils are due to move to a new site next to Oakengates Leisure Centre in a merger move with nearby Sutherland School. In the run-up to the event on Saturday, pupils and staff launched a website and appealed for past pupils to tell them about their memories in a bid to piece together a history of the school. Mr <mark>Jones</mark> said:\" I have been absolutely delighted by the commitment of all the students, teachers, parents and governors in organising this very special event. \"Everyone who has been involved with it can feel very proud indeed and when you see how many past students have turned out to join us it makes it all worthwhile .\" Music teacher Ben Millington has played a leading role in piecing together the history of the site. He said: \"We would still like to appeal to people to go on to our website, sign our guestbook and tell us about their memories and share old pictures. We know about how the school started and we obviously know about the present but there are still a lot of gaps in between, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s .\" The event featured performances by the senior choir, pupil rock and pop bands and also soloists. Teacher Rob Star bravely put his head on the block by asking pupils to pay for the privilege of throwing a wet sponge at him, while there was also a variety of stalls in the school playground. More than 300 past and present pupils of a Telford school, including an MP and an 88-year-old woman believed to be its oldest surviving pupil, turned out to celebrate its 80th anniversary. Staff and children at a Shropshire nursery are celebrating after being commended by education inspectors.

I did this for selfish reasons. If writing were to be my future, I wanted to write it all - facts, lies and everything in between. (Hence this column: I wanted to know the rules so I could break them .) I feel the exact same way about decorating: I don't like to feel pigeonholed. So was I thrilled with a recent conversation I had with a high-end-high-style designer friend who walked me through the design continuum, and said I could, in fact, have it all - just not all at once. \"Home d\u00e9cor runs the gamut from antique-filled traditionalism to stark modernism,\" Christopher Grubb, president of Arch-Interiors, in <mark>Beverly Hills</mark>, told me. \"If traditional is all about embellishment, zz and modern is about clean lines, you can't have both together. Can you?\" I asked. His short answer: Yes, kind of. But you must blend with care. Grubb told me about two stopovers on the design continuum between traditional and modern: transitional and contemporary. \"Some people find it relaxing to come home at the end of their work day to clean lines, so they find modern interiors relaxing,\" said Grubb. \"Others find them too sterile, and prefer their surroundings embellished by decorative arts .\" Those folks veer toward traditional. \"And some can't decide,\" I say. \"I tell those clients design is a language,\" said Grubb. \"When they gravitate toward an item that isn't going to fit, I say,\" Yes, that's great, but that's Chinese and we're speaking French .' \"\"And those hybrid interiors you promised me?\" \"They're bilingual,\" said Grubb, who then pinned down the hallmarks of traditional and modern interiors, and their bilingual hybrids, transitional and contemporary. Syndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \"House of Havoc\" and \"The House Always W ins\" (Da Capo Press). Contact her through marnijameson.com. Transitional (Provided by Arch-Interiors) Contemporary (Provided by Arch-Interiors) Interiors considered contemporary are the next stop up the continuum. They're decidedly more modern, but not purely so. \"The lines, and furniture shapes are modern, but the rules relax as comfort becomes important,\" said Grubb. Furniture fabrics are more comfortable than those in a modern interior, and here you may encounter chenille or a cotton print. In contemporary spaces, color, which is largely absent in modern interiors, can be featured on an accent wall or on pillows (used sparingly), other small furnishings, or in a collection of vases. \"However, you won't find carved wood, nor will you see a nod to antiquity. Rugs are geometric or tone on tone. Art will lean toward the abstract, though the look also might include an ethnic piece, like an African mask. 4. Modern These interiors are all about clean lines. They feature metal finishes, sleek surfaces, and zero excess. Think chrome, leather, glass, stone, and highly finished wood .\" Furniture is usually more sculptural and may not look comfortable, \"said Grubb .\" It's very Bauhaus and Le Corbusier. Spaces feel very museum-like. \"We reserve the right to remove any comment we feel is spammy, NSFW, defamatory, rude, or reckless to the community.

Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees Mogg said that his colleagues will take a two-week break next month. Something that they weren't allowed to do last year due to the impending Brexit deadline. The Commons will be in recess for 64 working days this year - not including conference season and the Christmas break, which has yet to be announced, reports the Mirror Online. The bumper breaks mean Boris Johnson will have to fewer sessions of Prime Minister's Questions and ministers won't have as many departmental questions sittings. It will give Parliamentary committees less time to scrutinise Government decisions through the year. Last year the Commons was in recess for just 46 working days, excluding the dissolution for the General Election.

Photo: Frazer Harrison / Charlize Theron was honored by Hollywood Friday for a\" fearless \"career in which she tackled themes including sexual harassment long before the #MeToo movement up-ended the industry. The 44-year-old South African Oscar-winner, who has often played down her flawless looks to win darker, more complex parts, collected the prestigious American Cinematheque Award at a <mark>Beverly Hills</mark> gala .\" I'm overwhelmed--I need a cocktail! \"she told AFP as stars including Kristen Stewart, Seth Rogen, and David Oyelowo gathered to honor her career .\" These people who are here tonight have been with me through a lot of stuff. \"Theron won the best actress Academy Award in 2004 with her turn as prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster. She earned Hollywood's respect with a visceral performance which saw her pack on 30 pounds (14 kg) and render herself unrecognizable with makeup and prosthetics to play the unappealing murderer .\" She is the most fearless actor I've ever worked with, and probably the most fearless human being I've ever met, \"said Jason Reitman, who directed Theron in Young Adult and Tully. Next month Theron appears in another transformative role--as former TV anchor Megyn Kelly in Bombshell, which depicts the downfall of Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes after a sexual harassment scandal .\" When I read (the script) it felt like it was part of a conversation that was happening now. And that to me, felt really important, \"she said. In contrast, her 2005 turn as a miner who files the United States' first class-action sexual harassment lawsuit in North Country came at a time when Hollywood turned a blind eye to such issues. Back then there was a sense that sexual harassment\" was in the past and that it's been dealt with, \"said Theron. The part earned her a second Oscar nod. A decade later, the #MeToo movement swept through Hollywood. Theron was born in the small South African town of Benoni in 1975. When she was 15, her mother shot and killed her father after he attacked them in a drunken rage. Her mother was never charged. Theron arrived in Los Angeles as a teenager in the 1990s speaking only broken English--her first language is Afrikaans. She was discovered by a talent scout in a bank, and broke into Hollywood's elite with The Devil's Advocate (1997), alongside Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino. Theron has since mixed commercial films such as the Fast and Furious franchise with tougher, less conventional roles.

Print 25.05.2017 08:45 AM Foreign steel producers on Wednesday called for prudence from the Trump administration as it considers possible actions to shield domestic companies from unfair imports on national security grounds. The remarks came at a public hearing that is part of a Commerce Department investigation into the effects of steel imports on US national security. The administration is also scrutinizing aluminum imports. The Trump administration's new stance has cheered US producers, who hope it will bring more relief to struggling industries than scores of scattershot anti-dumping cases. Domestic producers on Wednesday said unfair competition is undermining the US industrial base in ways that could jeopardize energy production and the manufacture of weapons, armor and vehicles. Still, some analysts say technological advances and increased productivity, more than trade, have accounted for much of the industry's job losses. John Ferriola, president of Nucor Corp, said his company's steel helped produce US Humvee light military trucks, Abrams battle tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, the Patriot surface-to-air missile system and the plating used for armored vehicles, Navy aircraft carriers and destroyers. That required \"continual investment\" in expertise, research, development and testing to meet exacting US Navy standards, he told the hearing. \"Unfortunately, global overcapacity and unfairly traded imports threaten our ability to invest,\" he said. \"Production overcapacity in the steel industry has reached crisis levels .\" - Trade barriers questioned - However, foreign producers told the hearing that new trade barriers could be both unnecessary and counter-productive. Karl Tachelet, head of international affairs at Eurofer--an association of European Union steel producers--said his organization had also been fighting unfair practices and global oversupply. \"We do not believe that restrictive, unilateral action based on national security will allow for lasting solutions we all need,\" he said, calling for the investigation to focus on \"specific uses\" directly tied to national security. \"What do tin mill products used to make cans for food and beverages have to do with national security?\" he said. \"How real is the risk that one day the US will not be able to produce enough rebar or sections for construction and infrastructure given its massive scrap availability?\" - China, Russia, Ukraine - <mark>Yu Gu</mark>, a representative of the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said the US Defense Department had found that US defense needs for steel were low, citing research that concluded that just three percent of domestic shipments served national defense purposes. \"Clearly, current and projected US national defense demand for steel can be readily satisfied by domestic production,\" he said. The deputy head of Russia's US trade mission, Alexander Zhmykhov, said his country's steel exports were already subject to heavy anti-dumping restrictions and duties in the United States, where certain imports have tumbled. \"Russian imports have already been so drastically limited by the measures enforced that further limitations would be excessive,\" he said. Ukraine's representative said his country's steel industry is under attack--suffering seizure and expropriation by foreign-backed separatists in industrial eastern Ukraine--but that security cooperation with the United States is also crucial to his country's stability. A 2001 investigation showed that the America was not vulnerable to imports of iron ore and semi-finished steel, said Vitalii Tarasiuk, minister-counsellor at the Ukrainian embassy. \"We are confident that evidence in this case will likewise show that steel imports do not threaten US national security,\" he said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday during a visit to Washington--where she met with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer--German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said she is worried the US steel investigation could result in higher tariffs on German exports of the metal and hopes to address the issue with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

The undersized quarterback ended up playing his college ball at an FCS school, where he would go on to break the record for the most passing yards thrown in a career. He proceeded to go undrafted, and then unsigned, though he received an invitation by the Pittsburgh Steelers to participate in their rookie minicamp. That was the point at which he began proving himself week in and week out to anyone that mattered. Over the course of three days, he outperformed first-year Brogan Roback, prompting the team to waive him and instead sign Hodges to the 90-man roster. He proceeded to turn heads throughout OTAs and all the way through the preseason, where he saw a disproportionate share of the snaps for a number four quarterback, a clear signal that the Steelers were taking him and his viability seriously. While generally working well within the scope of the opportunities that he was provided, it wasn't enough for the team to conclude that he was one of their three best quarterbacks. Behind Ben Roethlisberger, they decided that <mark>Mason Rudolph</mark> would be the backup, and Joshua Dobbs would be the number three. After being offered a fifth-round pick for Dobbs, however, they made the trade and signed Hodges to the practice squad. A season-ending injury to Roethlisberger a week later saw him promoted to the 53-man roster as <mark>Rudolph</mark>'s backup. Now with <mark>Rudolph</mark> in the concussion protocol, the rookie undrafted free agent is getting first-team reps for the first time and preparing to make his first NFL start after showing promise in his debut on Sunday filling in for the second-year man. \"I tell everyone I think it fits who I am\" , Hodges told reporters yesterday about the journey he has undertaken so far in the NFL. \"I never once didn't think I would be here or could be here. It is crazy, especially to be gone Week One and then coming back on the practice squad\". \"Some of the guys on the team were like,\" it felt like you were gone forever \"', he added .\" But then Ben going down and being brought up and <mark>Mason</mark> getting the concussion last week and getting thrown in. It is just crazy. It is a crazy process \". There's still a long road ahead for Hodges to really prove anything of himself. He only has a handful of pass attempts to his name, and his future is as yet unwritten. But he knows that if his story is one of success, that it will have been because of who he is .\" Even from the beginning, coming here on like a tryout, I told some people before that if five years from now or 10 years, if I am still playing in the NFL, this whole kind of story just fit who I am \", he said .\" It just shows that hard work and confidence in yourself and belief in yourself, you can accomplish your dreams \".
