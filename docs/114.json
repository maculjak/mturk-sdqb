appearances of the spring, had to be helped off the field by head trainer mike reinold and manager terry francona. the red sox later classified the injury as a \"contusion,\" with francona relaying following the 3-2 sox win that preliminary tests were somewhat positive. \"he was x-rayed, negative. saying that, he took a pretty good shot,\" francona said. \"it was below the kneecap enough where

auditioned for the show in the windy city--remains to be seen. as for the judges, they continue to talk at and over one another. minaj seems ready to run the show and direct the focus and, despite some peculiar interludes, seems more or less up to the challenge. she generally has interesting, insightful and pleasingly varied things to say about the young people who traipse into the room to sing. carey, meanwhile, appears to want to be paid her diva due at the judging table as well as from the string of contestants (and contestants' friends) who show up eager to declare their longtime admiration. urban just wants to go along and get along. and <mark>jackson</mark>? his rate of unkind \"dude, singing is not for you\" reality checks for contestants seems to be on the rise this year. is he growing as bored and irritable with the whole \"idol\" parade as many viewers are? (for proof, see wednesday night's ratings .) the auditioning contestants, though, were earnest and hopeful as ever. making it through on day one were mackenzie wasner, a tennessee 17-year-old whose musician dad plays piano for vince gill (he used to call mackenzie up on stage when she was little); kiara lanier, who had just sung for white house; stephanie schimel, whose \"dream a little dream\" impressed all the judges except--for reasons that may have had something to do with matching eye shadow--minaj; loud rock singer gabe brown; and fresh-faced 15-year-old isabelle parell. also going through that first day were good-looking wisconsin guy griffin peterson, in whom, curiously, only the women on the panel saw potential; inspirational charter school teacher curtis finch jr., who'd brought with him carey's no. 1 fan (though it's still not clear if his pal was right about mariah's favorite color); and recovering anorexic mariah pulice, whose story, singing and supportive family brought the judges to tears. brandy neelly, a 17-year-old who had been adopted by her aunt because her birth parents had \"physical and emotional\" issues; josh holiday, courtney williams and <mark>andrew jones</mark>, all seen too briefly to get a clear take on; clifton dufffin, whose mom and dad had never before heard him sing; season 11 returnee johnny keyser, who seemed to have the same effect on minaj he'd had on <mark>jennifer lopez</mark>; peculiarly compelling singer-songwriter kez ban, who confusedly tried to negotiate about paperwork with ryan seacrest; and last, but not least, lazero arbos, a cuban-born floridian who began stuttering at age 6 and is able to reliably stop only when he sings. deprived of their dreams, over the course of both days, were bedazzled-pink-stretchy-suit-clad melissa bush, who sang mrs. miller's \"downtown\" and may or may not have been in on the joke; fast-talking stick juggler kevin nabity; ieisha cotton, who the judges said should stick to dancing; misguided yet persistent (and persistently loud) musical theater major ashley curry; and a string of unnamed \"miserables .\" comments are filtered for language and registration is required. the times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy. readers may report inappropriate comments by clicking the report abuse link next to a comment. here are the full liguori takes reins at tribune!

(ap) - few doubt that brazil and argentina ultimately will qualify for the world cup finals next year in south africa. after all, brazil has played in every one, and argentina last missed out in 1970. but which other two teams will earn an automatic bid from south america? the picture should become clearer after two rounds of qualifying in the next week. a fifth south american team also will have a chance to make it, facing a playoff with the fourth-placed team from north and central america and the caribbean. paraguay, the only south american team besides brazil and argentina to play in the last three finals, leads the 10-team south american qualifying group with 24 points. with six matches remaining for all teams, paraguay is being chased by brazil (21), chile (20), argentina (19) and uruguay (17). those five are followed by colombia (14), ecuador (14), venezuela (13), bolivia (12) and peru (7). \"i think we need at least four more points to assure qualification to the world cup finals in south africa,\" said paraguay goalkeeper and captain justo villar, who plays for spain's valladolid. picking them up in the next couple of matches should be a challenge. paraguay faces third-place chile on saturday and plays away against brazil on june 10. in saturday's other games it's: uruguay vs. brazil, bolivia vs. venezuela and argentina vs. colombia. ecuador plays peru away on sunday. on june 10 it's: ecuador vs. argentina, colombia vs. peru, venezuela vs. uruguay, chile vs. bolivia and brazil vs. paraguay. paraguay's match saturday at home in asuncion will have a strong argentine flavor-paraguay's argentine coach gerardo martino will match wits with fellow argentine marcelo bielsa, who coaches chile. bielsa coached newell's old boys in the early '90s, and martino was his midfield playmaker. paraguay defeated chile 3-0 earlier in santiago, and the guarani will be strong favorites at home, but they also will be without several key players who are either injured or suspended. that includes strikers roque santa cruz and salvador cabanas, midfielder jonathan santana and defenders paulo da silva and dario veron. chile's main worry is probably goalkeeper <mark>claudio bravo</mark>, who picked up a leg injury with spanish club san sebastian. he missed chile's 4-0 loss to japan last week in the kirin cup, with chile using a second-team lineup. two-time world cup winner uruguay has played 10 times in the world cup finals, but only once in the last four. a country of only 3.5 million, uruguay has been close in recent years. in the next few days it faces both the best and worst the continent has to offer. brazil is always potentially the best team in the world with extravagantly gifted players, while venezuela is the only one of 10 south american teams never to have reached the world cup finals. the main news for the brazilians is the absence of ronaldo and ronaldinho from a team coach dunga named for the two qualifiers, and for the confederations cup. brazil travels to south africa on june 11 and faces egypt, italy and the united states in group play. brazil also may play without right back maicon, who has a right leg injury. ronaldinho's teammate at ac milan, kaka, and manchester city's robinho will lead brazil, along with sevilla's luis fabiano and milan's alexandre pato. ronaldo is a three-time world player of year, and dunga hinted he might be ready to return next year. \"ronaldo is returning from an injury,\" dunga said. \"i don't even think he would feel comfortable in the national team right now .\" argentina's last world cup qualifier was a humiliating 6-1 loss at bolivia, which ups the pressure on coach diego maradona, who has decided to bench usual starting keeper juan pablo carrizo and replace him with backup mariano andujar. \"a loss like bolivia hurts and it's not easy to forget,\" captain javier mascherano said. \"we have to take it as a lesson .\" in the concacaf region, costa rica embarrassed the united states 3-1 on wednesday in san jose, scoring after just 79 seconds and dominating every phase of the game. \"we consider us probably the fastest, strongest team in the region, but today we got out-passed, outplayed and out-competed in every sense,\" american goalkeeper <mark>tim howard</mark> said. \"we were below average across the board .\" costa rica leads the six-team qualifying group with nine points, two ahead of the united states. honduras has four points, followed by mexico with three, and el salvador and trinidad and tobago with two points each. the top three qualify for the world cup finals and the no. 4 team meets the fifth-place team from south america in a playoff for another berth."}, {"articleID": "2010021813_00019545_W", "names": {"Christopher Morgan":

or 5% more than the current market value of the home - to qualify for refinance. the program applies to those with mortgages held or guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises fannie mae (fnm: 0.62 -7.46%) and freddie mac (fre: 0.65 -7.14%). but critics for months have said the ltv limit will not reach the borrowers who need it most - those who purchased more than three years ago, with little money down and when house prices hit a peak. and with mortgage rates edging back up in recent weeks from historic lows, refinancing in general for those who do qualify is growing difficult. federal housing finance agency director <mark>james lockhart</mark>, in a press conference last week, acknowledged rising mortgage rates pose an issue to the agency refi program. \"there's a big pipeline so it probably won't hit for a couple months,\" he said. \"but at some point, if we don't see some moderation of rates, it could have an impact .\" he also acknowledged the administration is considering expanding the ltv range to cover borrowers with more than 105% ltv, although he would give no exact figure for the new ltv target. fhfa, fannie and freddie's conservator, has said applying <mark>lockhart</mark>'s comment to the effect of 125% ltvs are eligible for sale into real estate mortgage investment conduits toward plans for a new refi ltv limit are a misrepresentation of <mark>lockhart</mark>'s comments. media reports that the ltv limit could top as much as 125% might be speculation, but the idea is catching on, with jp morgan commentary on the mortgage-backed securities market late last week echoing the figure. \"we expect the proposal to raise the obama refi ltv limit to 125 [%] will have a minimal impact on speeds since only under 10% of the universe could benefit theoretically,\" the analysts said. housingwire, a website covering finance news for the housing market. like what you read? subscribe to our free weekly newsletter: looking for equity partners 2 fund d purchase of nonperforming i've already packed your parachute, all you have to do is jump (edmonton) joint venture specialists | outrageous roi | low down (forest lawn, calgary)"}, {"articleID": "2019102208_00175248_W", "names": {"Lynn Mcdonald": ["Q6709127", "Q6709129", "Q6763615"], "Richard Pike": ["Q18593431", "Q7328427"]}, "date": "2019-10-22", "url": "https://www.lynnnews.co.uk/news/pedal-to-the-metal-for-kings-lynn-food-bank-collection-efforts-9086843/", "content": "Pedal to the metal for King's <mark>Lynn</mark> Food Bank collection efforts By Ben Hardy -
