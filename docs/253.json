Ankara, which called for a special NATO meeting on Tuesday to discuss its security concerns, said two of soldiers were killed and four wounded in the latest attack by PKK militants. Long a reluctant member of the United States-led coalition against Islamic State, Turkey made a dramatic turnaround this week by granting the alliance access to its air bases and launching air raids against both the jihadist movement and the PKK. But the relapse into serious conflict between Turkey and the PKK has raised doubts about the future of NATO member Turkey's peace process with Kurdish foes that started in 2012, after 28 years of bloodshed, but has recently stalled. Four Turkish F-16 fighter jets deployed from the Diyarbakir air base in the country's mainly Kurdish southeast hit PKK targets in Hakurk in northern Iraq, the sources told Reuters. The strike came after a car bomb and roadside explosives hit a passing military vehicle on a highway near Diyarbakir overnight on Sunday, the army said. Kurdish militants then opened fire on the vehicle with rifle fire, it said. Four other soldiers were wounded. At least six people had been detained in connection with the attack, the Dogan news agency reported. The PKK, which Ankara and Washington deem a terrorist group, has also targeted police officers in the southeast and elsewhere, accusing the Islamist-rooted central government of covertly helping Islamic State to the detriment of Syrian Kurds. The outlawed PKK has waged an insurgency against Ankara for Kurdish autonomy since 1984. Opposition politicians and critics accuse President Tayyip Erdogan of taking up the campaign against Islamic State as political cover to clamp down on Kurds. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who has said the operations will continue as long as Turkey faces a threat, discussed security with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a telephone call overnight. NATO said ambassadors will meet on Tuesday to discuss security at Turkey's request. A senior US diplomat condemned recent PKK attacks but denied any link between Turkey's new strikes on Kurdish militants and its newfound boldness in tackling Islamic State, which has seized large expanses of neighbouring Syria and Iraq. \"There is no connection between these air strikes against PKK and recent understandings to intensify US-Turkey cooperation against ISIL,\" Brett McGurk, the deputy special presidential envoy for the coalition to counter Islamic State, said on Twitter, using one of Islamic State's acronyms. White House spokesman <mark>Ben Rhodes</mark>, on an official visit to Kenya with President Barack Obama, told a news conference in Nairobi: \"The US of course recognises the PKK specifically as a terrorist organisation. And so, again, Turkey has a right to take action related to terrorist targets. And we certainly appreciate their interest in accelerating efforts against ISIL.\" Turkey said on Saturday its decision to enter the battle against Islamic State, soon after an IS suicide bomber killed 32 people, mainly Kurds, in the Turkish town of Suruc, would help create \"a safe zone\" across the nearby border in northern Syria. Turkish opposition leaders say they are concerned that Erdogan wants the new attacks on the PKK to whip up anti-Kurdish sentiment before a possible early election later this year. The Islamist-based AK Party he founded has until late August to find a junior coalition partner or face an early election. The AKP lost its single-party majority last June for the first time in more than a decade, in part due to the success of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which entered parliament for the first time. \"One of the aims of the air, land and media operations carried out right now is to undermine the HDP in early elections,\" HDP head Selahattin Demirtas said on Twitter. & raquo;"}, {"articleID": "2019101417_00188421_W", "names": {"Derrick White": ["Q11320818", "Q30122669"]}, "date": "2019-10-14", "url": "http://mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Spurs-fans-don-t-know-if-they-should-panic-after-14520184.php", "content": "https: //www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Spurs-fans-don-t-know-if-they-should-panic-after-14520184.php Spurs fans don't know if they should panic after third preseason loss By Madalyn Mendoza, mySanAntonio.com Updated 12:07 pm CDT, Monday, October 14, 2019 @ kellynohandle: Spurs are about to lose their three straight preseason games outer me: it's ok.

No. 1 draft pick Zion Williamson and the Pelicans were in town Sunday and handed the team their third preseason loss. While some fans are firm in their decision to remain calm, others took to Twitter to share early predictions, citing issues they say could be a red flag for the regular season. \"Folks, I know it's preseason, but this Spurs team does not look good so far. They've played three lower-rung playoff teams, 2 at home, and have looked outmatched every time,\" Twitter user @ yungpopovich chimed in on the conversation. RELATED: Popovich blasts Trump's \"cowardly' approach to dealing with authoritarian figures Another corner of Spurs Twitter combated the preseason jitters and dismal takeaways with memes or by focusing on brighter moments, such as when retired legend Manu Ginobili was featured on the AT & T Center's\" Simba cam, \"when fans hoist their kids in the air to reenact the Mufasa moment from\" Lion King. \"\"I forgot about this but Manu was at the game yesterday. They had the Simba cam, and halfway through it, they cut to Manu holding his youngest like Simba. That was my favorite moment of the game,\" @ astroalehcat tweeted. At this point last season, the Spurs were also on shaky ground as the injured list included Lonnie Walker IV, Dejounte Murray and <mark>Derrick White</mark>. The Spurs take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. The regular season tips off on Oct. 23 at home against the New York Knicks. See more of the chatter in the gallery above.

Democratic officials in Virginia and nationally urged Mr Northam to resign after news reports of the photo, which appeared in Mr Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook and showed a person in blackface and a person in Klan regalia. Mr Northam refused to resign, however, and said on Saturday that he was not either of the people pictured.

Earlier this week, abortion opponents accused Mr Northam of supporting infanticide. In a radio interview, the governor described a hypothetical situation in which an infant who is severely deformed or unable to survive after birth is left to die. Mr Trump tweeted after those comments that \"Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion\" . As calls mounted on Saturday for Mr Northam to resign because of the photo, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated,\" I believe that I am not either of the people in that photo .'

Dalton, one of the Nittany Lions' many tight ends vying for an increased role this year, got an earful from Penn State's fiery quarterback after he was caught from behind and Cam Brown forced a fumble. The quarterback then tapped Dalton on the helmet after the exchange was over on the sideline as if to pick him up and say all is well. It was just one of those off nights for the Nittany Lions on the practice field, and McSorley wasn't the only one fired up following Penn State's practice inside Holuba Hall. \"I wasn't happy with today,\" <mark>James Franklin</mark> said after the 11th practice of the spring. \"We're a mature football team. You guys know we never run guys after practice, that's junior high stuff. I thought we were sloppy today. You guys know I'm a pretty positive guy, but I thought we were too sloppy, had too many penalties, balls on the ground, dropped balls, just a lack of discipline. I was not pleased today, but overall I thought we've had a damn good spring, but I was not pleased with today.\" <mark>Franklin</mark> had his players line the sideline for a series of wind sprints to conclude the workout, only to huddle them up and then send them back out for another sprint. He paced the field as they ran back and forth. The team's lack of focus was something that he said ultimately falls on him and on Penn State's leadership. \"Great teams, good teams don't do that,\" <mark>Franklin</mark> said of the sloppy practice. \"Obviously we've got a lot of growing up to do. It was unacceptable on every level. We'll never accept poor performances in the classroom, we'll never accept poor performances on the football field and we'll never accept poor behaviors in the community.\" Chemistry and leadership are often built during the offseason and <mark>Franklin</mark> was pleased that McSorley stepped up and displayed vocal leadership when getting on Dalton. While McSorley is the player teammates huddle around before games on Saturdays in the fall, his experience heading into his senior season should help the younger players understand what it takes in the spring to achieve success. <mark>Franklin</mark> hopes others continue to be more vocal, as well. If that means laying into a teammate for a lack of execution and then picking them right back up afterward, <mark>Franklin</mark> is all for it. \"I think he saw some things like I saw today that are unacceptable. Lack of focus, lack of finish, lack of mentality, lack of championship habits which is what we talk about all the time,\" <mark>Franklin</mark> said of McSorley. \"I would hope guys like Trace and <mark>Nick Scott</mark>, guys who've played a lot of football for us would speak up and hold themselves accountable and hold other guys accountable and call people out.\" I think that's one of our problems now in our society and especially specific to sports and specific to young people, everybody wants to be a leader by example and no one wants to be a vocal leader, \"<mark>Franklin</mark> continued.\" I don't care, in any organization, on any team you have to have some verbal leaders that are willing to speak up and tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. \"<mark>Franklin</mark>'s message to the team after he huddled them after the second set of sprints didn't fall on deaf ears.\" We just need to pick it up, \"running back Miles Sanders said.\" We let this day slip away from us ....I think this is our 11th practice, so, yeah, we just let this day slip away from us. . \"Other observations from the 11th practice of the spring: \u2022 <mark>Franklin</mark> said defensive end Shane Simmons is now more than 250 pounds after being\" undersized \"last year during his redshirt freshman season. Shaka Toney's weight is also up as <mark>Franklin</mark> said Toney is\" finally getting bigger and stronger. \"<mark>Franklin</mark> said defensive end needs to be an area of strength while the defensive tackles mature. \u2022 Sanders spent extra time this offseason working on catching passes out of the backfield. How has Sanders looked this spring?\" The challenge is he'll make four people miss and go 80 [yards] and we're all like, \"Next play' because we've been spoiled with Saquon Barkley for the last couple years,\" <mark>Franklin</mark> said. \"I do think Miles is in that conversation in terms of what he's been able show and what he's been able to do so far.\" \u2022 Penn State worked a few scenarios toward the end of the practice, including one from late in the game with Ohio State. <mark>Franklin</mark> likes to go back and highlight different scenarios from crunch time from seasons past to reinforce why they're out there going through so many scenarios even on a dreary day in mid April. \u2022 Punter Blake Gillikin, whom <mark>Franklin</mark> said last week could also take on kickoff duties this season, did so Wednesday. Gillikin is also the team's No. 2 kicker for the spring and is also the holder. Realistically, punting, holding and kickoffs could all be on his plate this fall. \u2022 Redshirt freshman CJ Thorpe might be Penn State's top lineman in the run game, <mark>Franklin</mark> said. Thorpe's nastiness was praised last year on the scout team and has carried over to the spring. For a line that was criticized by <mark>Franklin</mark> for lacking that nasty streak at points last season, that's a development worth noting. However, Thorpe needs to improve in pass protection. \"I want us to play with that mentality, to play with that edge,\" <mark>Franklin</mark> said. \u2022 Fellow redshirt freshman O-lineman Des Holmes is excelling in pass protection and needs to continue improving in the run game, <mark>Franklin</mark> said. Both Homes and Thorpe are 315-plus pounds and got what <mark>Franklin</mark> called \"unbelievable\" reviews for their scout team work last season. \u2022 McSorley has been high on Dalton this spring, praising him just last week for his development. Penn State needs someone to step up at tight end, which perhaps was part of McSorley's momentary frustration.

The defeat for the London club has seen them drop out of the top four in the league with Tottenham Hotspur beating Crystal Palace in the earlier kick-off on Sunday. United regained second place in the league after Liverpool took charge of the position for some 11 hours with United sitting level on goal difference but two points better off. United fell behind in the match after Willian broke behind United's defensive line and fired a shot diagonally past David De Gea. The lead for the visitors lasted just seven minutes after Romelu Lukaku scored the equaliser which was assisted by Anthony Martial. It was Lukaku's 22nd goal for Manchester United and his first against his former club. Perhaps those who operate Football Twitter will now be able to drop that\" Lukaku has not scored against a big club \"rubbish now? The match was won after Jesse Lingard replaced Martial in the 64th minute of the match and just 11 minutes later, the Academy graduate fired his 13th goal of the season, the eighth in the Premier League with a stunning header after Lukaku played the ball into the box. Lingard then celebrated by recognising the Black Panther, a recent release in the cinema. Mourinho spoke about the important result, his second victory over his former club at the Theatre of Dreams, speaking about how his side beat a very good team:\" I think we beat a fantastic team. For some reason, they were the champions last season. For some reason, they played the way they did against Barcelona. For some reason, they started the game so well as they started here. \"We beat a very good team and to beat a very good team, you need to be organised but you also need to have a humble spirit where everybody works, everybody fights, everybody tries to follow a game plan. I repeat, we beat a very good team.\" Mourinho then went into detail about how tight the match was. Last season, United won this fixture 2-0 after Ander Herrera man-marked Eden Hazard out of the game with both Herrera and Marcus Rashford scoring the goals. This game was not going to be like that, especially after Willian opened the scoring 13 minutes before the end of the first half. The equaliser scored by Lukaku opened the game up and United looked more likely to score again in the second half, which they did. Speaking about the tightness of the game, Mourinho said: \"They started very well, it's as simple as that. When Chelsea hit the posts, I was looking to my players and I was thinking\" what could we do?' or \"who can I blame?' but it was so beautifully played that I had nothing to say. They are a very good team--they have big routines of their football. They have a fantastic dynamic of the way they project the wing-backs.\" I was trying to find a way for my players to be dangerous in the interior football because through the sides Chelsea are very, very strong, so we found a way to play against them where we didn't concede much. \"I think we had a good control of Eden [Hazard], Willian, of course, is an amazing player and in that action [his goal] he killed us, but we took progression of the game, we had more and more control of the game without creating lots of chances because we didn't but they also didn't. That's the way I was expecting the game to be when I spoke with you before the game--a tight game.\" Scott McTominay started the match, his third in a row for United. Mourinho had tasked the 20-year-old to mark Hazard, which he did to the best of his abilities, also getting involved in other aspects of the game. Many criticise United's Academy players, even so-called United supporters, suggesting they are not good enough to play in the team. There seems to be an obsession with having world class players when that is not necessary for every position in the team. Manchester United are built on foundations of youth and that continues. Mourinho, speaking about McTominay, said: \"I think he's a fantastic player--a player that is what I call the modern midfield player, which in the end is a bit of what the top midfield players of the past were. They can do everything. The only thing he is not doing yet is scoring goals, which he can. But because I'm giving him different jobs, he's not yet free to do that.\" We are starting from the basics and the basics he's doing wonderfully well. I think he can also score goals--he has that talent. In pre-season, we understood that. But we are adapting him to his multi-functionality and he's doing fantastic jobs for us, like he did in Sevilla against Ever Banega and today against Eden, so I'm really happy with the player. \"Mourinho closed with the great team effort which was shown in the victory. The Portuguese manager singled out praise to Nemanja Matic for being phenomenal, Paul Pogba for playing a fantastic game in the midfield--yet the media will continue to talk about this rift and the fact Pogba will leave in the summer. He then stated that he could speak about his central defenders; Victor Lindelof, Chris Smalling, and Eric Bailly, who played the final nine minutes or so. Also talking about his attacking players and the mission Alexis Sanchez had. The United manager also mentioned McTominay again also talking about the big effort of the team as a collective. Mourinho, presumably after having been asked about the possibility of the match being a draw and Chelsea manager <mark>Antonio Conte</mark> suggesting a draw would have been a fair result, the Portuguese agreed that is was a possibility emphasising on the fact that United were much more confident in the second half of the game. Mourinho concluded by saying:\" I don't like to individualise--I think [Nemanja] Matic was phenomenal, I think [Paul] Pogba played a fantastic game in our midfield. I could speak about my central defenders too and the guys in attack--the mission Alexis had, to be the third attacking player but at the same time the fourth midfield player to try to cover the area in front of Scott. I think everyone made a big effort. \"Could the result have been a draw? Yes, it could. But I think in the second half we were more confident, we felt more confident with the defensive base and I think if somebody deserved a victory it was us. But, if you were to say a draw, I would accept that. The important thing for us is that we beat a fantastic team.\" United will have a break of a week before they play a match with the Premier League encounter with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park being played on Monday 5th March 2018, which will kick-off at 20:00 GMT and will be shown live in the United Kingdom on Sky Sports Premier League HD. United will be seeking another win in the league to cement their standing in second place, which could see them fall to third again in the league by the end of the weekend with Liverpool just two points behind United, entertaining Newcastle United at Anfield. United will face their North West rivals in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Saturday 10th March 2018, kick-off 12:30 GMT--another big match they must win this season. The reverse fixture at Anfield earlier in the season resulted in a 0-0 draw. If United are intent on finished in second place this season, beating those around them is what will be needed. United have already been beaten by Spurs, so the victory over Chelsea is half-way there with just Liverpool to silence once again in the coming weeks.
