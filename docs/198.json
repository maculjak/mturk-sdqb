Today, science is more important than ever. We live in a world in which science and technology are ubiquitous. Decisions are constantly made by governments, corporations, educators and others that affect us in profound ways. \"Jan 24, 2019--JLF Insider (@ JLFInsider) January 24, 2019 Jan 24, 2019 1:28 pm (IST) Bibek Debroy discussed The Puranas with Pushpesh Pant. Ancient Indian history and Hindu texts seem to be popular with many people at JLF with the masses flocking to Charbagh, Diggi Palace to hear Debroy speak .\" The puranas as well as the Ramanyanas and Mahabharatas suggests that all technologies like pushpak rath or brahmastras were always received from the god. Never invented by human beings. So people who suggest that India had all the science and technologies in ancient times must first read the puranas, \"said the author.

I GUARANTEE my team will win the SUPER BOWL!!\" <mark>Montana</mark> tweeted. Sports Connection Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. Kobe Bryant 9 hours ago \"He Was Special': The NBA Tributes Continue for Kobe Bryant NFL 9 hours ago Hall of Fame DE Doleman Dies at Age 58 <mark>Montana</mark> won four Super Bowl titles in 14 years with the 49ers before finishing his career with two seasons on the Chiefs when he made one trip to the AFC championship game. The path from San Francisco to Kansas City is a well-traveled one for quarterbacks with four other passers besides <mark>Montana</mark> taking that route as starters. In fact, for 11 of 13 years starting in 1988, a former 49ers quarterback led the Chiefs in passing. Here's a look at the QBs who have started for both San Francisco and Kansas City: STEVE DEBERG DeBerg began his NFL career with the 49ers in 1978 and was <mark>Bill Walsh</mark>'s first starting quarterback in San Francisco the following year. DeBerg led the NFL in attempts and completions running <mark>Walsh</mark>'s West Coast offense in 1979 but the Niners still went 2-14. DeBerg was replaced the following year as starter by <mark>Montana</mark> and <mark>Walsh</mark> famously described his tenure like this:\" He plays just well enough to get you beat. \"DeBerg went on to spend time in Denver and Tampa Bay before joining the Chiefs in 1988. He started 52 games over four seasons and led Kansas City to two playoff berths, beating the Raiders in the wild-card round in 1991. <mark>JOE MONTANA</mark> <mark>Montana</mark> had his greatest success in San Francisco, helping establish a dynasty that won four Super Bowl titles in the 1980s. But with <mark>Steve Young</mark> waiting in the wings and an elbow injury that sidelined him for almost the entire 1991-92 seasons, <mark>Montana</mark> was dealt to Kansas City in 1993. <mark>Montana</mark> showed he still had plenty left with the Chiefs, making the Pro Bowl his first year when Kansas City made it all the way to the AFC title game in 1993 for the first time since winning the Super Bowl in 1970. <mark>Montana</mark> led the Chiefs back to the playoffs the following season before retiring. STEVE BONO Bono spent five years as the backup in San Francisco, serving as the third-stringer behind <mark>Montana</mark> and <mark>Young</mark> in 1989-90 and then winning five out of six starts in 1991 when both stars were injured. The Niners traded Bono to Kansas City in 1994 and he backed up <mark>Montana</mark> once again his first year before leading the team to 13 wins in his first season as starter the following year. He started one more year before getting cut when the Chiefs turned to another former Niners quarterback. ELVIS GRBAC After three years as <mark>Young</mark>'s backup in San Francisco, Grbac signed with the Chiefs in 1997 for the chance to be the starter. He started the first nine games that season before getting hurt, but helped Kansas City win the AFC West. Grbac returned for the season finale and then lost the playoff opener at home to Denver. Grbac split time with Rich Gannon in 1998 before starting his final two seasons with the Chiefs. <mark>ALEX SMITH</mark> <mark>Smith</mark> was the No. 1 overall pick by San Francisco in 2005 ahead of Aaron Rodgers. He struggled his first six seasons as a pro as the Niners lacked offensive talent and stability as <mark>Smith</mark> was forced to work with a revolving cast of coordinators that hindered his development. That all changed in 2011 when coach Jim Harbaugh arrived and <mark>Smith</mark> helped lead the Niners to 13 wins and a trip to the NFC title game that season. But <mark>Smith</mark> struggled in that loss to the New York Giants and then lost his starting job the following year to Colin Kaepernick after suffering a concussion. Kaepernick led San Francisco to the Super Bowl and the Niners dealt <mark>Smith</mark> to Kansas City. <mark>Smith</mark> became the starter in coach <mark>Andy Reid</mark>'s first season and led the Chiefs to the playoffs in four of his five seasons in Kansas City. But he was 1-4 in the playoffs, contributing to the decision to draft <mark>Patrick Mahomes</mark> in 2017 and then deal <mark>Smith</mark> to Washington after that season. ___ More AP NFL: https: //apnews.com/NFL and https: //twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright AP - Associated Press This article tagged under: Super Bowl San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs <mark>Joe Montana</mark> 0"}, {"articleID": "2011101015_00112924_W", "names": {"Jim Price": ["Q1458383", "Q14950845", "Q14950988", "Q3512293", "Q6197608"]}, "date": "2011-10-10", "url": "http://sys-con.com/node/2013794", "content": "dell & vmware deliver the enterprise hybrid cloud are financial services organizations risking security by avoiding cloud computing?
