When added to $7.85 million settlement paid by the State Bureau of Investigation and its insurers, <mark>Brown</mark> has been compensated a total of $9.325 million for the 14 years he spent locked in Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh. <mark>Brown</mark> had been charged with the 1993 murder of Katherine Lynch, a retired Anson County school teacher. The only piece of evidence against <mark>Brown</mark> was a six-page confession that SBI Agent Mark Isley claims to have written down verbatim during a 1993 interrogation. Anson County sheriff's deputy Robert Poplin assisted during the interrogation. <mark>Brown</mark>'s attorneys called the confession a work of fiction. Doctors and psychologists agreed that its elaborate details were far too advanced for <mark>Brown</mark>, 49, who has an IQ around 50 and the mental capacity of a 7 year old. The Anson County settlement was struck in December. <mark>Brown</mark>'s attorney, David Rudolf of Charlotte, asked a federal judge to seal the settlement agreement to protect <mark>Brown</mark> from being \"manipulated and taken advantage of by ill-disposed individuals\" if the amount of the settlement were known. A federal judge agreed. Following the Anson settlement, Rudolf set up a special trust, which will manage the proceeds from both settlements on <mark>Brown</mark>'s behalf. The trust will receive about $5 million; the lawyers receive 40 percent of the award plus expenses. State law requires that all settlements by public agencies be public records. After being contacted by The News & Observer, a lawyer for the Anson County insurer asked that the settlement be opened. A federal judge unsealed it Wednesday afternoon. Anna Baucom, chairwoman of the Anson County Commissioners, said she had no idea that a settlement had been reached or its amount until contacted by a reporter. \"It's a sad situation all the way around,\" Baucom said. \"Nobody wins in this case.\" Anson County paid a $5,000 deductible in the case, according to Sean Perrin, the lawyer for the insurer. Insurance picked up the rest. In addition to SBI Agent Isley, two Anson County deputies worked the case; Lt. Bud Hutchinson and Poplin. No other evidence connected <mark>Brown</mark> to the scene. None of the evidence tested at the SBI crime lab linked <mark>Brown</mark> to the crime scene. Subsequently, Anson sheriff's deputies lost virtually all of the physical evidence. According to evidence discovered during the lawsuits, neither Isley nor the deputies investigated alternative suspects, including men who had assaulted Lynch two years previously. And none of the deputies nor Isley developed evidence to corroborate <mark>Brown</mark>'s alleged confession. In 1998, Poplin and Hutchinson pled guilty to federal racketeering charges for soliciting and taking bribes from criminal suspects in return for dropping or reducing charges against the suspects. Soon after his arrest, <mark>Brown</mark> was declared incompetent to stand trial by doctors at Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh. <mark>Brown</mark> was jailed at Dix until 2007, when Durham County Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson freed him after determining that <mark>Brown</mark> had been unlawfully held and that the confession wasn't enough to prove he had committed murder. <mark>Brown</mark> was never brought to trial because he did not have the mental competency necessary to stand trial. <mark>Brown</mark> is living fulltime with a caretaker, learning life skills at programs for the mentally disabled and dealing with health problems.

The new polymer \u00a3 20 note will replace the paper \u00a3 20 note featuring economist <mark>Adam Smith</mark> and has been hailed by the Bank of England as its most secure banknote yet. It includes two see-through windows and a two colour foil to help thwart counterfeiters. The Bank expects half of all ATMs across the UK to be dispensing polymer \u00a3 20 banknotes in just two weeks' time. The son of a barber and a wig maker, Joseph Mallord <mark>William Turner</mark> (1775-1851) became renowned as one of the great masters of painting. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790 aged just 15. (PA Graphics) <mark>Turner</mark> produced more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 sketches and drawings. He became known as \"the painter of light\" and had a keen interest in depicting nature such as extreme weather conditions and the violent power of the sea. Features on the new <mark>Turner</mark> note include:--A large see-through window with a blue and gold foil on the front depicting Margate lighthouse and <mark>Turner</mark> Contemporary. The foil is silver on the back. The shape of the large window is based on the shape of the fountains in Trafalgar Square. Just 2 days to go until the launch of the new \u00a3 20 note and we have another fact for you: all together, the \u00a3 20 notes currently in circulation weigh 1,780 tons.

Laid end to end, two billion polymer \u00a3 20 notes would stretch around the world almost seven times and weigh the equivalent of more than 141 double decker buses, the Bank said. The note will join the Sir Winston Churchill \u00a3 5 and the Jane Austen \u00a3 10 in the Bank of England's first series of polymer notes. A new polymer \u00a3 50 featuring Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing will be issued next year. Speaking at Tate Britain, which houses the <mark>Turner</mark> Bequest, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: \"Our banknotes celebrate the UK's extraordinarily rich and diverse heritage and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens. <mark>Turner</mark>'s art was transformative.\" I am delighted that the work of arguably the single most influential British artist of all time will now appear on another two billion works of art--the new \u00a3 20 notes that people can start using today. \"<mark>Turner</mark>'s self-portrait, as featured on the new \u00a3 20 note, is on display at Tate Britain alongside the banknote. Home to the <mark>Turner</mark> Bequest which includes 300 oil paintings and many thousands of sketches and watercolours, Tate Britain will present a major new exhibition dedicated to <mark>Turner</mark> later this year--<mark>Turner</mark>'s Modern World. The new \u00a3 20 note is the first to feature the signature of Sarah John, the Bank's chief cashier. She said:\" Moving the \u00a3 20 note to polymer marks a major step forward in our fight against counterfeiting. I am very grateful to everyone across the cash industry who has made this transition possible and I hope the public enjoy using their new <mark>Turner</mark> \u00a3 20s. \"The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has been working with the Bank to make money accessible for people with sight loss. The new note has tactile markings on it with three separate clusters of dots along the short edge to differentiate it from the \u00a3 10 note, which has two clusters of dots. It is larger than both the \u00a3 10 and \u00a3 5 notes. <mark>David Clarke</mark>, RNIB director of services, said:\" Handling cash can often be a challenge if you're blind or partially sighted, because it can be difficult to tell the difference between the different notes and coins. We hope the creation of these notes will help enable people with sight loss to use money more easily and with confidence. \"By incorporating tactile features on money, we are closer to creating a more inclusive society; it's the small changes that can make a big difference to independent living.\" The Bank has said that polymer notes last longer than paper notes and remain in better condition. But a previous freedom of information request by the PA news agency found that nearly 50 million plastic \u00a3 5 and \u00a3 10 notes have had to be replaced since they were launched by the Bank of England due to wear and damage. Around 20 million of the Bank's new polymer \u00a3 5 notes were replaced in the first three years since they were introduced. And about another 26 million \u00a3 10 notes were replaced in the two years since they were launched in September 2017. Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, said: \"We are thrilled that <mark>Turner</mark> is featured on the new \u00a3 20 banknote.\" As one of Britain's greatest artists--perhaps even the greatest--<mark>Turner</mark> is a key figure in the history of art. \"0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2018022015_00085296_W", "names": {"Rick Gates": ["Q42429771", "Q92901"]}, "date": "2018-02-20", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/mueller-probe-london-based-son-of-russian-businessman-to-plead-guilty-to-false-statements/2018/02/20/142f4d2e-164b-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921_story.html?tid=pm_local_pop", "content": "The London-based son-in-law of a Russian businessman is set to plead guilty Tuesday afternoon in Washington to making false statements in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to a new court filing. Alex Van der Zwaan was charged with one count of making false statements, a felony, about his work as an attorney employed by a law firm engaged in 2012 by the Ukraine Ministry of Justice to prepare a report on the trial of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko was imprisoned by former president Viktor Yanukovych for signing in 2009 a controversial gas supply deal with Russia. Van der Zwaan is the son-in-Russian oligarch German Khan. U.S. prosecutors in Mueller's office said the case was related to former Trump 2016 presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was an adviser to Yanukovych. Manafort and his longtime employee, <mark>Rick Gates</mark>, have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, fraud and money laundering charges arising from the allegedly secret lobbying work for a Russian-friendly political party in Ukraine.

In a two-page information document, prosecutors alleged that Van der Zwaan falsely told the FBI and Mueller's office that his last communication with <mark>Gates</mark> was in mid-August 2016 in an innocuous text message and his last communication with another, unnamed person was in 2014 when Van der Zwaan discussed that person's family. Van der Zwaan also allegedly falsely said he did not know why a September 2016 email between him and the other person, identified in court documents only as\" person A \"was not produced to prosecutors. In fact, prosecutors alleged, Van der Zwaan spoke with both <mark>Gates</mark> and Person A regarding the report on Tymoshenko and recorded the calls. Van der Zwaan also allegedly\" deleted and otherwise did not produce emails \"sought by prosecutors and an unnamed law firm. A criminal information is a type of charging document that can be filed only with a defendant's permission and usually indicates the person is cooperating with investigators. A judge does not have to accept a plea deal, and a defendant can change his mind before making a plea. U.S. authorities in 2016 asked the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm for information and documents related to its work on behalf of Yanukovych's government, including Manafort's work arranging the report that was used by the former president's allies to justify his rival Tymoshenko's arrest.

They share a love of dogs and a career in the spotlight. Both are blonde singers, born into German Catholic families. They both - in Schneider's words - have \"chosen a few shockers of men\" in their time. It's fitting that Schneider has co-written (with <mark>David Mitchell</mark> of Dusty and Shout! fame) a stage show tribute to pay tribute to the iconic actress and singer, who is now in her 90s.

Schneider was seven or eight years old when she first saw Day on screen, starring in the film Calamity Jane. \"I just fell in love with her in that role,\" she said. \"I just loved her as a personality - she was a great singer, great dancer, wonderful comedian.\" Being born into a country music family, that film resonated with me because of the Western theme. \"What Schneider loves best about Day is that she is a\" survivor \".\" She's survived four tumultuous marriages, her third husband lost all of her money so she went bankrupt, \"she said.\" She even had a brush with Charles Manson. \"In researching the show, Schneider read many biographies and got to know some of Day's friends, who live in Sydney. Schneider said the Melinda Does Doris show she was bringing to Mackay next month was a smaller,\" more intimate \"version of her full theatre show of the same name.\" That version of the show was like a mini-musical, with big sets, an eight-piece band, horns and two dancing boys, \"she said.

Nick Matthews on <mark>Brown</mark>'s legacy As <mark>Gordon Brown</mark> disappears into the dustbin of history as the man who saved the Union, it is appropriate to take a look at his significance. There is no doubt that he was both the architect and builder of new Labour's economic policy which has been so difficult for Ed Miliband to shake off. This is probably because he has persisted in dragging the dead weight of Ed Balls around with him. Balls not only represents the <mark>Brown</mark> legacy but offers little hope that Labour has learned anything from those years. My own view is that history will be much kinder to <mark>Brown</mark> the prime minister than to <mark>Brown</mark> the chancellor. This is probably the exact opposite of the popular perception. <mark>Brown</mark> the prime minister may have offered up a Freudian slip in the Commons when he said he had \"saved the world\" but to a large extent he had. When the banks teetered on the edge of collapse in 2008 he bailed them out and put up taxes. <mark>Brown</mark>'s bank nationalisation and bailout was the right thing to do. The alternative would have been catastrophic. However at a greater distance one can see that in effect the banks nationalised the government and socialised their losses. Did <mark>Brown</mark> extract enough from the state's newfound role as the owner or part owner of these banks? The answer is no. That bargain could only have been struck at the moment of disaster when - for a moment - the power moved to the state. But <mark>Brown</mark> asked for little or nothing for underwriting the banks to the tune of \u00a3 1,162 billion. On the plus side, <mark>Brown</mark>'s Keynesian efforts to counteract the crisis meant the economy was returning to growth - before <mark>George Osborne</mark> put the brakes on with his first emergency budget and derailed the whole process, costing billions in lost output. However that is only a small part of <mark>Brown</mark>'s record. As chancellor he was a slavish supporter of Alan Greenspan who for 18 years was boss of the US Federal Reserve. The same Greenspan who finally admitted when the banks were collapsing that he had found a flaw in the theory of \"perfect markets\" - a flaw that had been obvious to most of us for years. Having pursued policies of deregulation and liberalisation, Greenspan had now found \"he made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.\" In pursuing the same policies and making London a safe haven for rogue global capital, <mark>Brown</mark> turned the City in to the world's largest tax haven. One of his daftest ideas and one the Establishment continues to praise him for was making the Bank of England \"independent.\" One of the greatest triumphs of the post-war Labour government was the nationalisation of the Bank of England. The idea that the policies pursued by the bank can somehow be depoliticised is fatuous. At this level economics is politics. What's more, an independent bank for years kept UK interest rates higher than those in mainland Europe, doing untold damage to Britain's manufacturing sector. <mark>Brown</mark> managed to destroy one-and-a-half million manufacturing jobs in the process. As well as liberating the City and the financial services sector to do their worst, his next crime was the way he structured the welfare state to create a set of subsidies to the private sector. His complex web of in-work benefits kept workers trapped on low pay and subsidised bad employers. Simultaneously housing benefit grew as private-sector landlords had a field day ratcheting up rents to milk the subsidy. What's more, because ordinary people received little benefit from his largesse they did not thank him at the ballot box for this spending. There are other examples, including the way that private-sector provision of care for children and the elderly has fallen in quality and risen in cost. A week does not go by without some scandal in these private services. He was truly naive in thinking ownership did not matter and you could use regulated markets to achieve better services for the public. Clearly Blair and <mark>Brown</mark> both had a malign influence in the Labour Party. <mark>Brown</mark> was ruthless in rooting out any opposition to his policies and spent an inordinate amount of time jousting with Blair in placing his cronies in safe parliamentary constituencies. It is clear now that the golden years of <mark>Brown</mark>'s chancellorship can be seen as being funded by fool's gold.
