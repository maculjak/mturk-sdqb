county legislature held a special session to vote on a pilot agreement to continue negotiations on the hardscrabble wind project. the project has been in the planning stage for five years already and on friday, the proposal passed with 14 votes in favor and only one abstention from bruce weakley of poland. two legislators were absent from the vote - helen rose of herkimer and jeffrey stone of ilion. last month, the fairfield town board unanimously voted to issue a permit to build wind turbines on hardscrabble road. the council of norway has also expressed its approval in the project. <mark>raymond smith</mark>, chairman of the herkimer county legislature, believes the project is in everyone's interest. \"so, we're not standing in the way of progress,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. \"the legislature feels it's the right thing to move forward with the project .\" the next step is for the industrial development agency (ida) to hold a public hearing for final arrangements. after the ida makes the final agreements, the legislature will need to approve it before the project is officially started. \"i think it's a good thing for the county,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. \"it's going to bring quite a bit of new money into the county .\" <mark>smith</mark> expects nearly $17 million into the county from payments alone, saying construction workers working on the project will

sunday, vs. carolina college park, md.--it's been a long time since the maryland men's basketball team found itself contending for the top spot in the atlantic coast conference, a distinction duke typically is in the running for every season. it's also been a long time since the terps played a game. athletics department and conference officials postponed the team's contest wednesday against virginia because of the area's second major snowstorm in a week. that game will be made up monday at the comcast center. the terps last played sunday, a victory against north carolina. today against the no. 8 blue devils at cameron indoor stadium, the terps will have to reconcile the longer-than-usual layoff with the magnitude of the game. the winner will claim first place in the conference with just a month remaining before selection sunday. \"we tried to keep them busy with video and practice, but you know, you can't practice eight hours,\" maryland coach <mark>gary williams</mark> said of his players' activities this week. because of the blizzard-like conditions and difficulty clearing campus roads and parking lots, university of maryland students haven't had classes since feb. 4. at the terps' 92-71 victory against the tar heels on sunday, administrators allowed between 2,000 and 3,000 students without tickets into the comcast center, knowing many season-ticket holders would be unable to make the treacherous drive to college park. <mark>williams</mark> said the team prepared monday and tuesday as if it were going to play the cavaliers on wednesday. that game was officially postponed tuesday afternoon. \"then that switched to duke. that was good in terms of not having six days to get ready,\" <mark>williams</mark> said. \"in other words, we were in a game situation--we were gonna play wednesday night. we were getting ready for that. then when that switched, you have that little comedown, maybe emotionally, but you can switch teams .\" this duke team, while ranked in the top 10, has shown that it's vulnerable inside and on the bench in losses to wisconsin, north carolina state and georgetown. but the blue devils (20-4, 8-2 acc) have easily handled conference opponents at home. their average margin of victory in acc play in front of the cameron crazies is 18.8 points per game. guards jon scheyer and nolan smith, along with forward kyle singler, account for nearly 66 percent of the team's scoring. still, <mark>williams</mark> said facing that potent trio--and playing before what should be a frenzied crowd--shouldn't faze his team. \"you can't go picking out one game and say,\" this game's really gonna be tough,' \"<mark>williams</mark> said .\" well that just means you can't win, and we've won down there before. we've won by playing our game. \"the terps' game lately has been stellar defensive play inside, efficient 3-point shooting, and the ability to play either an up-tempo or more halfcourt-oriented style. maryland (16-6, 6-2 acc) hasn't been in serious contention for the acc's no. 1 spot since the 2002-2003 season, a year after the terps' only national championship. you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment.

officials with northwood health systems now have the option to file their lawsuit against gov. joe manchin for alleged political retaliation because the required 30-day notice has passed. northwood chairman of the board <mark>patrick casey</mark>, however, said the company would like to resolve the matter without going to trial in federal court. manchin's general counsel, jonathan deem, said the governor also wants to reach an agreement with northwood outside of court. northwood continues operating on its original license - it expired sept. 30 - because the office of health facility licensure and certification, a division of the west virginia department of health and human resources, has declined to renew the company's license. \"we will wait (to file the lawsuit), as long as we are making progress,\" <mark>casey</mark> said of the company's ongoing negotiations with state officials to acquire a new license. \"it is a long process and there are many issues to work through. but i am cautiously optimistic .\" <mark>casey</mark>, however, added, \"we are fully prepared to proceed with the suit\" when discussing northwood's options in the event the negotiations do not yield the company a new operating license. deem said manchin \"is hopeful that northwood reconsiders filing a lawsuit .\" \"the lawsuit is frivolous and would not advance the interests of northwood or its patients ....northwood has options outside of spurious litigation to address the health and safety issues that led to the loss of its provider's license,\" he said. northwood - an organization with about 450 employees serving more than 3,000 mental health patients in ohio, marshall and wetzel counties - in january filed its intention to sue manchin in wheeling's u.s. district court for the northern district of west virginia. the company alleges in its complaint that ohflac targeted the company because northwood supported a bill manchin opposed during the regular 2009 legislative session. ohflac found only five total violations at the 27 northwood facilities in all of 2007 and 2008, combined, but cited northwood for 175 deficiencies from february to november 2009. <mark>casey</mark> cites this increase as evidence manchin wants to shut down the company. northwood acknowledges ohflac's findings that three patients died in the company's care during a two month period last year. <mark>casey</mark>, however, believes those patients died from natural causes. manchin has flatly denied any involvement in the proceedings regarding northwood's license renewal. \"this is an absolutely irresponsible action by northwood and its attorneys. northwood should focus on what is truly important: the health, safety and welfare of its patients. their allegations against me are completely false and this lawsuit is an obvious attempt to divert attention from the serious health and safety concerns identified at some of northwood's facilities,\" the governor said in a statement. <mark>casey</mark>, however, believes the company's claims have merit. \"as a lawyer, i would never sign a document without believing i could support it,\" he said. northwood alleges manchin targeted them for supporting west virginia senate bill 672 - which would have provided more money for behavioral health care - during the 2009 legislative session. though the bill passed unanimously in both the senate and house of delegates, manchin vetoed the legislation. manchin, however, disputes such notions. \"northwood's suggestion that i would abuse government services to settle a political score is irresponsible,\" he said. while northwood continues negotiating with state officials to gain a new license, the company continues to operate. if ohflac does not renew northwood's license, the company's 3,000 mental health patients and 450 employees will need somewhere to go. \"if any center like northwood shuts down, the dhhr is responsible for working with the center on finding placement for their clients,\" dhhr spokesman <mark>john law</mark> said. <mark>law</mark>, however, declined to say if he believed the state could find placements for all of the clients, citing the fact that the matter is \"in litigation .\" <mark>casey</mark> hopes ohflac will grant the company a new license. \"it would be devastating for the northern panhandle,\" <mark>casey</mark> said of a possible northwood shutdown in the event the company cannot acquire a new license. west virginia delegate orphy klempa, d-ohio, said that he and other northern panhandle legislators \"have spoken to the governor about northwood .\" \"it is a huge concern for us, not only because of the service that northwood provides, but because of the 450 people who work there,\" klempa said. \"we need to hold onto all of these jobs .\" regarding how he believed the negotiations with state officials would go, <mark>casey</mark> said, \"i will have a better feel for it in two weeks .\" according to its \"prayer for relief\" in the court complaint, northwood wants to have its licenses fully restored; to ensure that \"retaliatory behavior by government officials\" stops; and to ensure that northwood is held to the same standards as those of similar health care providers. the intelligencer / wheeling news-register 1500 main st. | wheeling, wv 26003", "articleID": "2010021405_00026102_W", "names": {"John Law": ["Q16731294", "Q16866581", "Q16866744", "Q29643115", "Q6244134", "Q6244136", "Q6244142", "Q6244146", "Q645685"], "Patrick Casey": ["Q19877723", "Q7146214", "Q7146216"]}}, {"date": "2010-02-15", "url": "http://blog.taragana.com/health/2010/02/14/indian-data-on-swine-flu-shamefully-inadequate-virologist-19406/", "content": "0 indian data on swine flu shamefully inadequate: virologist bangalore - warning that india should brace for more deaths from the swine flu (h1n1) pandemic, a leading virologist has described as \"shameful\" the lack of scientific data on its outbreak in the country. \"even though india has over 28,000 confirmed cases and 1,152 deaths - which would translate into manifold more - no epidemiological analysis of the indian outbreak is found in the public domain,\" says shahid jameel of the international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology (icgeb), new delhi. \"we do not know the risk factors for the indian population, the reasons for a mortality rate that is about three to four times the global average, or any epidemiological details of the terrifying spread in cities like pune,\" jameel wrote in the latest issue of the journal \"current science'. there are also no genomic sequences from india uploaded in public databases, making it difficult to analyze the virus circulating in india, he said .\" considering that icmr (indian council of medical research, new delhi) has an entire national institute dedicated to disease epidemiology (national institute of epidemiology, chennai), it is shameful that no epidemiological analysis of the outbreak is available, \"the scientist who heads the virology group in icgeb noted with surprise. he said it is imperative that such information be in the public domain for all stakeholders to analyse it and participate in the vaccination strategy. reacting to statements by icmr and the health ministry that a vaccine against the h1n1 pandemic virus will soon undergo bridge trials in the country, jameel wonders who will receive it .\" have we identified the risk groups? \", he asks pointing out that in the absence of any epidemiological analysis of the indian outbreak it is difficult to select the recipients .\" even in the presence of a public health preparedness plan, an early initiative to screen for the pandemic virus, and the government's generous spending on the testing initiatives, experts believe that a poor healthcare infrastructure has failed the country, \"jameel said .\" there is a clear need to strengthen that. \"jameel said the government's aggressive screening of passengers at ports of entry did help delay the spread of the virus in india by two to three weeks, but it eventually followed an expected pattern of spread - first in large urban centres followed by small towns .\" we do not even know the situation in rural areas, \"jameel said. according to jameel, daily updates being released by the health ministry since aug 1, 2009, remains the only source of information on h1n1 spread in india. based on the analysis of this limited data - updated till jan 20, 2010, - jameel has concluded that h1n1 cases did increase in what appeared to be a second wave .\" since the \"mortality curve' runs almost parallel to the\" cases curve,' and as the number of cases increase, we should be prepared for more deaths, \"he warns. according to jameel, an over-zealous media coupled with the government's perceived lack of transparency and an inherent mistrust of the government system created widespread panic and knee-jerk reactions. this is not good for dealing with any pandemic, he said. jameel predicted there will be more cases and more deaths, but calm and sustained response (and not panic) is the only way to overcome it. at the same time, he said, there is a need for more transparency from government institutions and the media should be considered partners in disseminating the message .\" and the message is that this pandemic is serious but we have the tools to manage it. \"thankfully, the mortality is still low, said jameel, the question remains if this virus will return in a more virulent form in the next wave .\" the 1918 pandemic started that summer as a mild disease, but in the next wave during winter, the virus came back in a highly virulent form, eventually infecting about a third of the world population and killing an estimated 40-50 million people. \"according to the icgeb scientist,\" this history of pandemic flu is reason enough to exercise caution and limit virus transmission in the human population \". cdc: swine flu has made more than 57 million americans ill, but cases remain down lately february 12th, 2010 new delhi -
