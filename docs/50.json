[{"date": "2009-12-24", "url": "http://northcarolina.scout.com/2/931907.html", "content": "by the end of 2009, it is estimated that nearly 47,000 households in north carolina and over 2 million nationally will lose their homes due to foreclosure. that's a staggering level of human pain to contemplate. and it's pain that <mark>roy williams</mark> can identify with. at one point during his elementary school years, <mark>williams</mark>, his mother, and his sister were forced out of their house in asheville after his often-absent and eventually separated father failed to keep up with the mortgage payments. to this day, <mark>williams</mark> says he dreads people in dark sportcoats like the kind the men who informed his family they would have to leave within three days. much media attention to <mark>roy williams</mark>' autobiography, hard work, has focused on relatively current events - the period since about 1998 - and the specifics of what <mark>roy</mark> has to say about various people and events during that time period. fans who have not read the book may assume this is just another self-serving memoir by a coach who wants a neat recruiting tool, or that <mark>williams</mark> is setting himself up as a paragon of virtue. all biographies are representations of the self, all books by coaches are recruiting tools, and any book called \"hard work\" makes the implicit claim that the author is a good exemplar of that virtue. but the essential purpose of the book, as <mark>williams</mark> says in his preface, is to help readers understand him a little better. in that task, the book succeeds spectacularly - not because of what <mark>williams</mark> has to say about his success and tenure as a big-time basketball coach, but because of the remarkable opening 50 pages where he describes his childhood, teen years, and early adulthood. getting kicked out of his house as a kid was just one of the stresses <mark>williams</mark> faced. his father was an alcoholic who was often absent, and when present and drunk, often unpleasant. his mother struggled to get by with less than a high school education, supporting the family through factory work supplemented by rare child support payments. <mark>roy</mark>'s older sister started work at an early age too, meaning that by age 11 or 12 <mark>williams</mark> often was an unsupervised child. how did an 11-year-old boy from a broken, poor family who had never even heard of the idea of college until high school grow up to become the outstanding college basketball coach in america? five factors explaining that remarkable arc emerge from <mark>williams</mark>' narrative, each building upon one another. the first is <mark>williams</mark>' love of basketball, the activity that freed his mind from other worries and provided a badly needed outlet and a way to spend the time alone. the second was unquestionably his mother along with his sister. <mark>williams</mark> was fully indulged in his love for the game by his mother, who never complained about his bouncing the ball at home and later recorded <mark>roy</mark>'s scoring statistics during all his high school games. and, famously, she always left a dime for young <mark>roy</mark> to get a coke after his daily pickup basketball games. third, and perhaps least well known by tar heel fans, is the role of the local asheville community, particularly high school coach buddy baldwin. <mark>williams</mark> gives many large and small examples of the way people in the community looked after him, but baldwin played the key role, starting with words of encouragement he offered to <mark>roy</mark> after his 9th grade season on the junior varsity, suggesting he could be a varsity player. that inspired <mark>williams</mark> to bust his butt all summer so he could make that team (and indeed be a starter). more importantly, it inspired <mark>williams</mark> to want to be a coach. it felt good to be appreciated as a player and to be motivated to succeed by the words from baldwin. <mark>williams</mark> recognized (unusually early in life) how great it must feel to be able to make that kind of difference in someone else's life. fourth, there is the university of north carolina and everything that comes with it. <mark>williams</mark> turned down basketball scholarships and numerous small schools to come to chapel hill, knowing he would only ever be a junior varsity player for carolina - if he made that team. but, encouraged by baldwin, he reasoned that his best chance of becoming a basketball coach was to hook on to the carolina program and learn from <mark>dean smith</mark>. through a series of events whose common thread is <mark>williams</mark>' own persistence and passion for the game, he did get that opportunity in chapel hill despite never being a varsity player. but it was the existence of a large scale public university committed to providing opportunities to talented students from all over the state that made <mark>williams</mark>' career trajectory possible. this brings us to the fifth factor explaining how <mark>williams</mark> eventually become a magnificently successful head coach at kansas and north carolina: <mark>williams</mark> himself. <mark>williams</mark> does not blow his horn too much in this department, but one thing that comes through in the book is what a good student he was in high school - he was even offered an academic scholarship to georgia tech. the second obvious thing that comes out is just how driven <mark>williams</mark> was from a very early age, and his capacity for, yes, \"hard work,\" a drive that is inseparable from his love of competition. intelligence, passion and work ethic are generally a powerful combination. but they are more powerful still when connected to particular sense about what one wants to do with one's life. <mark>roy williams</mark> recognized that it was basketball and a basketball coach that kept his difficult and stressful childhood from translating into an aimless life marked by no goals and no serious aspirations. <mark>williams</mark> coaches now to win games and satisfy his own competitive drive, no doubt. but he also recognizes that the fundamental purpose of coaching is to inspire others, and that what is most important about basketball and sports in general is its capacity to shape young people's lives. <mark>williams</mark> quotes an inscription given to him by a former unc jv player stating, \"the true measure of a man's greatness is not in the number of his accomplishments, but in the number of people's lives he inspired while achieving those accomplishments .\" corny as all get out? maybe, but that doesn't make it wrong. that phrase sums up as well as any how <mark>williams</mark> sees his vocation. what the first fifty pages of this book does is show exactly how and why <mark>williams</mark> thought pursuing that vocation was the most valuable thing he could do with his life. *** i was surprised at how moved i was by this book. as someone who's followed <mark>williams</mark>' career every step of the way from his initial hire by <mark>smith</mark> in 1978 - my brother attended one of the unc faculty/staff kids clinics <mark>williams</mark> recalls in the book - and as someone who even had <mark>williams</mark> as a coach for one memorable week of carolina basketball school, i assumed i knew pretty well what <mark>williams</mark> is about. but this book rounds out and adds to the picture in important and at times surprising ways. yes, you will understand <mark>roy williams</mark> \"a little better\" by reading this book. i'll go further and say that the time was right for a book like this. at a similar point in <mark>dean smith</mark>'s career, the journalist thad mumau wrote an informative biography of <mark>smith</mark> called \"more than a coach\" that recounted his kansas childhood, drawing on interviews with <mark>smith</mark>'s family members, including his parents. the book had a lot of insight into <mark>smith</mark> and where he got his values and aspirations from. <mark>williams</mark> had a very different childhood than <mark>smith</mark> and in some respects is a very different person as well. one measure of that difference is the fact that only <mark>williams</mark> could have told his own story: he dedicates the book to his mother, father, and sister, saying he wish they could read his words. even if a journalist had had access to his family members before they passed away, they wouldn't have been able to convey what exactly it feels like to be an 11-year-old from a family having a difficult time, dribbling a basketball for hours and hours on a muddy court - an essential part of this story. another measure of that difference is that one senses that, at some level, <mark>williams</mark> needed to tell some of these stories - some quite painful, others simply poignant. these aren't the kind of stories you casually mention in an interview. the autobiography format gives him an opportunity to share parts of his life and indeed parts of his soul that otherwise might never have found public expression. economic stress and borderline poverty are still difficult topics for many americans to face or talk about. <mark>williams</mark>' childhood was difficult in many ways, but in other ways he was quite blessed - in particular, blessed to be part of a community that cared about him and encouraged him to develop himself, and not allow himself to be constrained by his circumstances. it is not a clich\u00e9 but simply truth that millions of kids in america today, december 2009, face economic and family circumstances as tough or tougher than those young <mark>roy williams</mark> faced. some of those kids, thousands and thousands, are probably still finding a measure of solace and comfort from shooting baskets, for hours and hours. i hope those kids are also lucky enough to get the kind of support and inspiration <mark>roy williams</mark> got from his family, his coaches, his teachers, his friends' parents, and the community at large. and i hope that readers of <mark>williams</mark>' book will take to heart the deepest underlying message of the book - <mark>williams</mark>' gratitude and appreciation towards those who gave him the love, guidance and encouragement required to make great things possible. <mark>williams</mark>' book recollects a community that didn't let him fall through the cracks. as those cracks get wider with every passing month, <mark>roy williams</mark>' life story serves as a quiet but moving reminder of the need to restore those kinds of communities again, in north carolina and everywhere else.", "articleID":

"http://triplepundit.com/2009/04/virgance-and-the-business-of-activism/", "content": "has managed to do something completely unusual: attach a business model to activism. how? by starting anti-boycotts. by fostering collective bargaining for alternative energy buys. by letting ordinary citizens dip into huge corporate philanthropy funds. what started last year as one novel idea - that maybe consumers should try to buy their way into making a business more sustainable - has grown into a venture-funded startup that calls itself a platform supporting activism 2.0. if the web 2.0 movement showed that the internet could be monetized, activism 2.0 might prove that do-gooders can turn a profit. brent schulkin is an energetic 28-year-old who always seems to have a group of people around him. he certainly did when i met him at the k & d market in san francisco's mission district one saturday morning in late march last year. in fact, there were hundreds of people, lined up nearly around the block waiting to get into a completely unremarkable bodega. schulkin, by using email, facebook and bevy of other social media tools, had managed to entice the crowd to arrive and shop en masse, forming what he called a carrotmob (oh, that's carrotmob \u2122 now). to earn such patronage, k & d agreed to use a 22 percent cut of sales made during the buying frenzy to make efficiency improvements in the store. an incredible $9400 in wine, soap, cheerios and other corner-store fare was rung up that day, and after subtracting all the taxes and crv (california refund value), the store put $1,840 toward green renovations. but the bigger success was the buzz this carrotmob generated. consumers are drawn to the notion that they can influence a business to become more sustainable, and not by boycotting the business but by patronizing it - essentially giving it the funds to make sustainability improvements. after that first mob, schulkin hoped he'd parlay the effort into a thriving non-profit that stages carrotmobs regularly and at all kinds of businesses. instead, he co-founded virgance with steve newcomb, a 39-year-old entrepreneur and political advisor who has been involved in nine other startups, which collectively generated more than $3 billion in market value (he founded powerset and loudfire). the two of them have pulled together a growing team of other fresh-faced upstarts and added a number of other campaigns to the agenda. last fall, virgance acquired 1 block off the grid (1bog), an effort that was started by a san francisco couple who decided that if they banded together, homeowners could make the process of installing solar panels cheaper and less arduous. 1bog forms groups of potential solar buyers within cities - it's up to four now (sf, san diego, la and new orleans) - and then uses collective bargaining to get discounts on the panels and installation costs. in exchange for generating so much new business for the solar installer, 1bog gets a cut of the profits. partnered with sunrun, a well-funded solar purchasing program that installs panels on homes but retains ownership of the panels and in return the homeowner pays a reduced rate for power. other projects are in the works, including a facebook campaign called lend me some sugar, wherein virgance will act as an agent for managing and distributing a company's corporate social responsibility funds (a process for which it will be paid) and then facebook members will get to choose how the funds are spent. another project to come is a green investment portfolio in which facebook members will invest small amounts ($100 range) and virgance will get a cut of investment profits. schulkin says the next carrotmob in san francisco is in the making, and that this time he'll be crowdsourcing the business selection process - look for video pitches by three bay area business owners to appear on the carrotmob site and you'll be able to vote for the one most deserving of a mob. green options media. its founder <mark>david anderson</mark> says that what attracted him to the virgance platform is the scalability it offers the green options sites (it published blogs aimed at a number of sustainability-related topics, from transportation to food). \"before, whenever yahoo would pick up one of our stories, the traffic would crash our servers,\" he says. indeed, it's the bandwidth and web development power that virgance offers that adds the real business power to the projects it supports. raised $750,000 in funding and has noted that it's already seen profits through the 1bog venture. \"we are excited about any idea that causes positive social change,\" schulkin told me last fall, \"and we are really excited that 1bog is the first sign that this will work .\" great story - totally inspirational and another good example that folks can do good and do well at the same time. i hadn't heard about virgance, but will certainly spread the word, and would love to see them in the boston area. blog comments powered by disqus", "articleID": "2009122523_00059305_W", "names": {"David Anderson": ["Q1175128", "Q16150074", "Q18572352",

face manchester united on wednesday night with manager roberto martinez insisting his side have improved immeasurably since they last met. on that occasion, back on august 22, the latics conceded five having held the defending premier league champions at bay for 56 minutes. martinez always stressed the result did not do his side justice and believes they are much better equipped to cope with united. \"we all know the 5-0 defeat was not a clear reflection of the performance, when i was very pleased for 60 minutes,\" said the spaniard. \"we are a different team to the one in the first half of the season .\" physically we are a lot stronger, the partnerships are there, the players have a clearer understanding and we can change things around a bit. \"tactically we are more multi-dimensional and in every aspect we have improved .\" there is still a long way to go because we are very thin on numbers and the way we want to play we need to have that extra support. \"but we hope we can make our fans proud .\" boxing day's 1-1 draw at home to blackburn saw martinez keep the same 11 players on the field for the full 90 minutes - mainly to give those who had been so poor in the first half chance to redeem themselves. even with a couple of days' extra rest compared to most sides he is considering making changes, although he will not follow the controversial move of wolves manager <mark>mick mccarthy</mark> who made 10 changes for their recent trip to old trafford. \"we cannot afford to do it because we are quite thin in numbers in that respect but we go into every game trying to win,\" said martinez. \"what happened in the first half (against blackburn) had certain needs and we changed things around but had to keep those players on the pitch .\" manchester united are completely different opposition with different demands and tempo in the game so everyone should be ready. \"the players that were on the bench could have a good chance to be involved because we need absolutely everyone and everyone has an opportunity to play .\" every club has a different agenda but where we are now we want to go anywhere in the premier league and try to win a football game. \"we approach the game at old trafford with a big smile, praying and hoping the christmas spirit will be with us. you need to try to get some positives out of it .\" martinez can at least expect a warm welcome from counterpart sir alex ferguson after the spaniard revealed they have been able to \"laugh off\" the media storm which they were caught up in recently. a spanish newspaper, in late october, attributed comments to the latics boss which claimed the football association were afraid to punish ferguson. the comments, which martinez categorically denies making, also suggested the likes of blackburn and everton managers sam allardyce and david moyes were staunch defenders of the united boss and that liverpool boss rafael benitez was being targeted with constant sniping. however, martinez had a pre-christmas meal with ferguson, allardyce, moyes and stoke assistant <mark>peter reid</mark> and the wigan boss said the incident was not an issue. \"it has happened to many managers in the past and it will happen in the future,\" said martinez. \"what is important is to put the record straight and make sure the names that are involved have a clear understanding of what has happened .\" once that is done it is quite simple to understand because we have all been in a situation when we know how exposed we are and how easy it is for it to happen. \"i think we have got a good relationship, good enough to laugh off these situations .\" it is not an issue and it does not put any strain on our relationship at all. \"hull city 20.00 dec 30th 2009 2 - 2 sunderland chelsea

hong kong - if not for his \"bad\" family background, mo shaoping might be a senior military officer now. instead, he has become one of china's leading human rights lawyers, representing prominent political dissidents, journalists and even practitioners of the banned falun gong sect. skip to next paragraph related verdict in trial of chinese dissident could come friday (december 23, 2009) his clients have included <mark>huang qi</mark>, who recently was sentenced to three years in prison after demanding an investigation of school collapses in last year's sichuan earthquake; <mark>zhao yan</mark>, a researcher for the new york times who was accused of revealing state secrets; and <mark>liu xiaobo</mark>, who was jailed three times before his current detention, charged with \"inciting subversion\" for his work on the charter 08 democracy manifesto. at the trial, which started wednesday, mr. <mark>liu</mark> will be represented by other lawyers from mr. mo's firm. mr. mo has been barred from representing mr. <mark>liu</mark> directly, because he also signed charter 08, which calls for political reforms and the rule of law. \"i don't agree that he should be convicted,\" mr. mo said of mr. <mark>liu</mark>. \"these things can be debated over, but you can't just send people to prison .\" taking on politically sensitive cases can be hazardous for chinese lawyers, but mr. mo has made this his mission for more than a decade. he began defending dissidents in 1995, when the wife of <mark>liu</mark> nianchun, a veteran democracy advocate, could not find any other lawyer to defend her husband. \"my position is that whatever crime someone has committed, he should always have the right to a lawyer. that is one of the most basic human rights,\" mr. mo, 51, said in an interview in hong kong, where he was attending his daughter's university graduation. \"i believe it is for posterity to judge who is right or wrong .\" perhaps fortunately for his clients, mr. mo was thwarted in his original career ambitions. he joined the army at the age of 18 in 1976, just as the cultural revolution ended. but when he tried to enter a military college a year later, he was told he did not qualify because of his \"complex family background .\" he later learned what that meant. his paternal grandfather had been a landlord and a delegate to the national legislature under the kuomintang government, before the communists took power in 1949. his maternal grandfather had been a professor of philosophy and religion, with a doctorate from the university of chicago. both men had died during the cultural revolution, one tortured by red guards, the other driven to suicide. mr. mo, born in beijing, had never met either grandfather, both of whom had lived in southern china; he had not even known of their deaths, or the circumstances. because of the political climate of the time, his parents - both doctors who were sent to labor in the countryside along with other intellectuals during the cultural revolution - had never discussed his grandfathers' undesirably \"bourgeois\" backgrounds with him. asked whether his grandfathers' sufferings had given him a sense of solidarity with those who face political persecution, the mild-mannered, bespectacled lawyer laughed. \"i suppose it might be in my genes,\" he said. after he left the army in 1980, he was assigned to work at the beijing municipal procuratorate and later studied law at the beijing college of politics and law and the prestigious chinese academy of social sciences. while the new york-based organization human rights watch praises mr. mo as having handled more high-profile human rights cases than any other lawyer in china, he notes that these are also the riskiest and most time-consuming cases and bring the least monetary reward. and he has yet to win one. his clients all have been jailed or exiled for promoting democracy or daring to challenge the communist party's monopoly on power. \"it's impossible to win these cases,\" he said. \"the best you can hope for is a compromise .\" \"compromise\" means the defendant might be given a suspended sentence or be permitted to go into exile, as was xu wenli, a founder of the banned china democracy party. fighting cases that you never win could be demoralizing, but mr. mo insists his efforts eventually will be vindicated. \"if you don't even speak for them, no one will hear their voices,\" he said of his clients. \"but history will prove whether they were right or wrong .\" mr. mo says recent years have been particularly difficult for lawyers. he cited the example of the beijing-based legal aid center open constitution initiative, which has challenged china's so-called \"black jails\" and campaigned for the rights of death-row inmates. recently it was shut down, ostensibly for tax evasion. and more than a dozen rights lawyers were disbarred after failing a mandatory annual review, widely criticized as a vetting system to disqualify lawyers disliked by the authorities. \"if this is used to crack down on or to target those who are not obedient,\" mr. mo said, \"then it isn't right .\" given such harsh conditions, and the publicity his career has attracted - time magazine named him an \"asian hero\" in 2003, and he received the french government's human rights prize in 2007 - is mr. mo worried that he might be a target? he said his wife, who also is a lawyer, worries about him. his phone is monitored, and the authorities often summon him over cases he is handling. still, mr. mo believes he has been allowed to continue his practice and travel freely because he focuses on the legal technicalities of his cases and avoids emotive political statements. \"i do my bit to push forward democracy and rule of law,\" he said, \"but writing essays is not my thing .\" nicholas bequelin, a senior asia researcher at human rights watch, said few lawyers had mr. mo's ability to handle political cases in a strictly professional, depoliticized way. \"not many lawyers have been able to emulate his example,\" mr. bequelin said, \"because they lacked the tactical skills needed to know when to back down and when to push forward, but also because beijing was not ready to tolerate many more prominent defenders for high-profile dissidents .\" mr. mo remains hopeful about his country's future. democracy, he said, is never a straightforward road. \"it's a historical trend. china will move towards democracy, rule of law and constitutional governance,\" he said. \"and no one can stand in its way .\" more articles in world \"a version of this article appeared in print on december 23, 2009, in the international herald tribune.", "articleID": "2010010200_00111078_W",

cup is january priority for blackburn rovers, says allardyce (from lancashire telegraph) blackburn rovers this month as boss sam allardyce admits reaching the carling cup final is january's priority. rovers travel to <mark>martin o'neill</mark>'s aston villa this afternoon for an fa cup third round tie but allardyce admits he already has more than half an eye on tuesday's villa visit in the carling cup semi final first leg. allardyce's men also face a trip to manchester city and a home game against fulham in their battle for premier league points in the coming weeks but, for the moment, the rovers boss is dreaming of glory. he said: \"this month becomes one thing and one thing only first and that is trying to get to wembley .\" alright, premier league is what we are all about and definitely the most important for the football club but not this month. \"we will deal with the premier league when it comes around .\" this month is going to determine whether we slip into a battle for premier league survival only or whether we are top of the tree in terms of going relatively well in the premier league and looking forward to a wembley final and even possibly getting through to the next round of the fa cup. \"this is the biggest month of the season for us and every player will have to give more than they have given all year, and they have given a lot, but they will have to give a whole lot more if they want to achieve something special and we are on the brink of achieving something special .\" they have to take it by the horns and make sure they are not miserable by the end of it. \"rovers fans can expect a number of changes to be made for today's clash as allardyce uses his squad to the limit to ensure freshness for the games ahead. <mark>steven reid</mark> could be set for a rare start, after returning from a loan spell at qpr, while young defender <mark>phil jones</mark> is also expected to be handed another senior chance. villa are also expected to name a weakened line-up, for a match <mark>martin o'neill</mark> has at the bottom of his list of priorities, as both managers look to limit the effects of a busy month .\" it doesn't happen very often in life does it?, \"said allardyce .\" i had to chuckle when the draw came out, i thought what have we got here. \"from my point of view seven games in january and we have built of squad of players that are there to be used in times like this .\" we now begin to use the squad to its full potential because of the amount of games we have got and the size of the games we have got. \"first we have the fa cup third round, which is always a glitzy thing but in the month term is not the top priority so we have to manage as best we can to get the golden prize .\" if we beat villa on saturday that would be fantastic but it won't be as important as beating them on tuesday night. \"then going on from there we have manchester city and we have to pick up more premier league points because we have let too many slip and then going to next semi final. morst the 88th min heartbreaker of dingles!, accrington says...great to hear it bs - days like wembley are what its all about! miracles do happen! just look at the team that started the 2002 final against spurs all-stars. we have already beaten villa in the league with 10 men so ant rovers fan giving up already is plain daft - come on you blues!. for the older rovers fans on here you may like to know the 2002 final dvd also has a section that looks back at 1960 and 1987 wembley trips - bring a tear to tha eye! well worth the \u00a3 6.67 in the 3 for \u00a3 20 offer. . now lets do it again - get down to ewood tuesday night. . security - east-ride - well i suppose wembley is slightly east of us! paolowhite, oswaldtwistle says...11:55 am sat 2 jan 10 think i would make the league more priority...can play the carling cup every season...dont take were eye off the prem completely bed and breakfast man _!, the riverside says...while i welcome what sam says about going to wembley, i also think he should also start putting a bit more effort into our position in the premiership. good chance's missed over christmas, but i think i will be saying the same, at the end of the season. kevin e, portugal says...12:49 pm sat 2 jan 10 the premiership should be the number one priority in my opinion. . how gutted will we all be if we can look back at having won the carling cup but have still been relegated?. as long as those squad members coming in give of their best we can maybe do both - let's hope so. villa will be approaching the tie in the same way so we should have a decent chance of matching them. . it's good to hear that reidy is in contention and that dunny is nearing fitness once again. we will need a fully-functioning midfield if we are to come through january in good style. woody riversider, blackburn says...2:11 pm sat 2 jan 10 1:56 pm sat 2 jan 10 oh i'll be there no matter what the weather or climate at the moment down ewood:) the chelsea game was pulsating & i don't see this game being any different? we all know what\" dirge' is being surved up at ewood at present in the main but, this isn't about sa this is about our football club' y' know the one that is pushing all the boundary's. the one that as seen finals, semi finals, top 6 finishes in the last 5/6 years. tough? course it's chuffin tough, well what do they say?: \"when the going gets tough the tough get going'!! their will be 20,000 brfc on tues or thats what i would expect along with villa, so 25/26000? come on you\" blues' this isn't the prem this is a chance to go to: wembleeee!! this is any-ones game & do you want to miss it for \u00a3 15 dabs? just think crappy luke warm bovril & cardboard chips & seconds pie's!! you'll soon be

woody and morst. we are all feeling a bit underwhelmed with the fare offered at the mo - but lets not let this semi final pass us by. this is a chance for glory and lifetime memories. lets not deny ourselves to spite sa. if sa is too stubborn to change his style then he will fall on his sword eventually regardless of his record in the cup. this one is for us. we have done well in the cups recently but you never know this could be our last chance for years? lets get ourselves down and roar on the lads - and while we are at it lets force some humble pie down the throats of messrs freidel
