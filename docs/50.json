Duration | time}} SAN ANTONIO--The NBA is paying tribute to the wife of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. Erin Popovich died Wednesday at 67, the team said. Her death came after a long illness, the San Antonio Express-News reported. LeBron James, who was playing Game 2 of Cleveland's first-round series against Indiana, was visibly upset when told after the game. \"Obviously, I'm a huge Pop fan. I love Pop. That's such a tragedy,\" James said during his postgame interview on TNT. \"My best wishes go out to Pop and his family. That's devastating news .\" The NBA family, we all stick together. I know we compete every night. But something like this happens, it puts everything in perspective. \"Popovich is the current Olympic men's basketball coach. James calls him a\" mastermind of the game \"and has said he'd consider playing for the U.S. team under Popovich at the 2020 Tokyo Games after skipping the Rio Olympics. Popovich has coached San Antonio since 1996, leading the Spurs to five NBA titles. San Antonio trails Golden State 2-0 in their first-round playoff series. The 69-year-old Popovich ran practice Wednesday, but there was no immediate word on his status for Game 3 on Thursday night. Assistant coach Ettore Messina likely would lead the team if Popovich were to miss it. When told of Erin Popovich's death, Golden State's Kevin Durant said from San Antonio:\" Seriously? Man. Prayers and condolences go out to his family. \"The Popovichs have two daughters and two grandchildren. They met at the Air Force Academy in the 1970s when he was an assistant coach for the Falcons. Erin's father, Jim Conboy, was Air Force's head athletic trainer. Spurs general manager RC Buford called Erin Popovich a\" strong, wonderful, kind, intelligent woman who provided love, support and humour to all of us. \"Former Spurs assistant and current Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said he has known her a long time .\" Their family is wonderful, \"he said .\" Their family has been incredibly kind to my family. And she was a star, like a real star. A very strong woman, and somebody that will be missed. \"<mark>Bill Russell</mark>, <mark>Magic Johnson</mark> and Kobe Bryant were among those expressing condolences on Twitter. <mark>Steve Nash</mark> wrote on Twitter,\" Knowing Pop, it's fair to assume Erin Popovich was an absolute legend. My deepest sympathies to Pop and his daughters. \""}, {"articleID": "2014070905_00043802_W", "names": {"Greg Wilson": ["Q18159211", "Q19880107", "Q27924954", "Q42363410", "Q51936191", "Q5606441", "Q5607217"]}, "date": "2014-07-08", "url": "http://www.kezi.com/drive-less-save-more-in-corvallis/", "content": "CORVALLIS, Ore. - A new program in South Corvallis is encouraging residents to use alternative modes of transportation.

The city is hosting several free events throughout the month in both English and Spanish. \"We're trying to encourage people to not drive alone,\" said <mark>Greg Wilson</mark>, Transportation Program Specialist with the City of Corvallis. \"To save energy, and to not pollute the environment by using a different transportation option. It's in everyone's best interest to save energy .\" The program is targeting South Corvallis because the Willamette River geographically isolates it from the rest of the city. <mark>Wilson</mark> says the program is informing residents about walking and biking paths in the area, as well as transit and ride share opportunities. On Tuesday from 7:30 - 8:00 p.m., the program is hosting a free bike repair class in English and Spanish at the Tunison Community Center. Child care and snacks will be provided. Residents can also get free bags with gear for biking and walking, including maps, water bottles, umbrellas, and bike lights. The city will also host a free ice cream walk later this month.

He urged the judge to impose a sentence short enough to permit Manning to someday return to society. \"The defence requests a sentence that allows him to have a life,\" he said. There may be no soldier in the history of the army who displayed such an extreme disregard. At least 60 years is justified. Pfc. Manning is young. He deserves to spend the majority of his remaining life in prison The maximum term that army judge Colonel Denise Lind said she could give Manning is 90 years, without the ability to apply for parole until he has served a third of his sentence. She will announce the sentence today. The judge acquitted Manning of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, but convicted him on others, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act.

or at least spent money before it became necessary. \"a change in the date could engender skepticism, confusion and distrust the next time government asks them to undertake specific actions in anticipation of a major event,\" <mark>shapiro</mark> writes. additionally, <mark>shapiro</mark> offers the obama team and congress five alternatives to pushing back the date: a fix of the accounting issues such as the anti-deficiency rules that are preventing ntia from sending out coupons despite available funding. only 19 million of the 33.5 million available coupons have been redeemed. examine total funding for the coupon program and explore any need for additional funding, for example, to send coupons out via first class mail to eliminate three week delivery delays. elimination of the 90-day expiration date on coupons, which would put more coupons into use. explore additional funding for government call centers and funding to local grassroots groups to answer questions about the dtv transition. should the government determine that the supply of converter boxes will not meet demand, examine permitting use of converter box coupons to purchase access to digital television either through pay service (cable, satellite or fiber) or credit toward purchase of a limited feature or low cost digital television. subscribe to the ce pro newsletter cea's <mark>gary shapiro</mark> assails govt. regulations, certain union activities allied manufactures of motorized products announces electric shade company, inc. as newest founding find the it and ce pros you need, where and when you need them. free trial"}, {"articleID": "2018123005_00222107_W", "names": {"Timothy Parker": ["Q7804094", "Q7807451"]}, "date": "2018-12-30", "url": "http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/slippery-business-plagiarism", "content": "A blog from the Center for International Higher Education Title The Slippery Business of Plagiarism Students, especially those who come from corrupt environments where plagiarism is prevalent, but ignored, or seen as a trivial offense, need better guidance. By Plagiarism is a widespread problem around the world. It can take various forms--copying and pasting text without acknowledging its source, \"recycling\" or self-plagiarism (presenting the same paper several times as original), purchasing papers from an agency or a ghostwriter and submitting them as one's own. With the benefit of new technologies, cheating is booming, such that some countries are describing a \"plagiarism epidemic'. [1] In the United Kingdom, for example, almost 50,000 university students were caught cheating from 2012 to 2015. This is only the reported cases--how many more cases remain undetected? Students, especially those who come from corrupt environments where plagiarism is prevalent but ignored or seen as a trivial offense, need better guidance about the consequences of violating the rules of academic integrity. For example, during the academic year 2014-2015, the Department of Immigration in Australia cancelled 9,250 international student visas--plagiarism was one of the reasons cited in addition to other forms of academic misconduct [2]. Students need to understand that plagiarism during the course of their university studies could have significant repercussions--not only in the short-term, but also for their future careers. Some famous politicians have been implicated in plagiarism scandals. Following the public scandal revolving around plagiarism identified in their dissertations, German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg resigned in 2011 and German Education Minister Annette Schavan in 2013. Evidence of plagiarism was found in the dissertation of Ursula von der Leyen, the current German Defense Minister. Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy, scholars at the Brookings Institute, found extensive plagiarism in the dissertation of Russian President, Vladimir Putin,\" Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Mineral Resource Base of a Region under Conditions of the Formation of Market Relations (St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast), \"which he'd successfully defended at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute in 1997. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was thwarted by a plagiarism scandal that dated back to his law school years and that ended his 1988 presidential campaign. Can undetected plagiarism during a person's studies embolden the inclination to cheat in a future profession? High profile personalities including <mark>Timothy Parker</mark>, the crossword puzzle editor for USA Today, and Fareed Zakaria, CNN anchor, have been caught in recent plagiarism scandals. Are more students cheating now than before? Not according to the recent study by Curtis and Vardanega (2016) [3], who actually observed a downward trend among students at Australian universities in 2004-2014. At least since some forms of plagiarism can now be detected. Scholars have raised the alarm, however, indicating that about 70% of students do not consider all types of plagiarism (see Table) to be wrong. In another study, Curtis et al. (2013) [4] found that only 25% of first-year students at Murdoch University recognize all practices considered to be plagiarism; this number increased to 50% after completing courses on academic integrity. Curtis and Vardanega (2013) argue that text-matching software and educational interventions help to protect standards of academic integrity and are among the most successful mechanisms for positively change. Denisova-Schmidt et al. (2016) [5] discovered that the frequency of use of some forms of cheating might increase significantly during university studies. Comparing first-year students with more advanced students at selected Russian universities, the scholars found that copying off during exams or tests increases by 25%; downloading term papers (or other papers) from the internet by 15%; and purchasing term papers (or other papers) from special agencies or from other students by 12.5%. The scholars also voiced concern about the students' lack of awareness of what constitutes cheating. Copying and pasting from the Internet without any acknowledgement of source seems to be business as usual for many students at Russian universities. Many unprepared students are sent to universities all around the world. If secondary school education is failing to address this problem, then higher education institutions must acknowledge this issue by developing a better understanding of why students resort to plagiarism and addressing these motivations specifically. In addition to various anti-plagiarism policies and procedures, incorporating the use of special software programs like Turnitin or Unicheck, and developing ratings of universities based on their tolerance of plagiarism, [6] the faculty should present assignments and expectations more clearly to students. All of these remedies might still be insufficient when plagiarism is the only way that some students feel they can succeed or when plagiarism is a plea for help [7].

The previously unknown, flu-like coronavirus strain is believed to have emerged from an animal market in central Wuhan city, with cases now detected as far away as the United States. Contrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, China's communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year. \"The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading,\" National Health Commission vice-minister <mark>Li Bin</mark> said. The World Health Organization (WHO) was meeting to rule if the outbreak was a global health emergency. After official appeals to stay calm, many Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks, avoiding public places such as cinemas and shopping centres, and even turning to an online plague simulation game or watching disaster movie \"The Flu\" as a way to cope. \"The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,\" said one commentator on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The virus has spread from Wuhan around China to population centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong. The latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose from nine to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying. Official newspaper China Daily said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country. Abroad, Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one. President Donald Trump said the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a good containment plan. \"We think it is going to be handled very well,\" he said at Davos in Switzerland. RESPIRATORY THREAT <mark>Li</mark> said the virus, which can cause pneumonia and has no effective vaccine, was being spread via breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. \"I believe the government for sure, but I still feel fearful. Because there's no cure for the virus,\" said <mark>Fu Ning</mark>, a 36-year-old woman in Beijing. \"You have to rely on your immunity if you get an infection. It sounds very scary .\" Fears of a pandemic initially spooked markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit and the yuan falling, but they regained their footing on Wednesday in approval of China's containment response. Canadian public health agencies ramping up in response to new virus Macau confirms first new coronavirus case: News agency Officials confirm first U.S. case of China coronavirus Across China, companies from Foxconn to Huawei Technologies and HSBC Holdings were warning staff to avoid Wuhan and handing out masks. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said he was advising employees not to visit China. With more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China's main industrial and commercial centre and an important transport hub, home to the country's largest inland port and gateway to its giant Three Gorges hydroelectric dam. Chinese officials believe wildlife trafficked at a market there was the source of the coronavirus. Two sources said provincial and city officials in Wuhan had been ordered to remain in the city, while those who had already left were instructed to report their whereabouts. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring. But <mark>Li</mark> said there was no evidence of \"super-spreaders\" capable of disseminating the virus more widely, as happened during the SARS outbreak. SARS was thought to have crossed to humans from civet cats sold for food. GLOBAL PRECAUTIONS Airports round the world stepped up screening from China. Russia said it had strengthened its sanitary and quarantine control, Britain said it would start enhanced monitoring of passengers from Wuhan, and Singapore started screening all passengers from China. The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus and tightened body-temperature screening measures. A first case emerged in Hong Kong on Wednesday, media reported, with the patient arriving via high-speed railway from the mainland. \"The whole world is watching,\" the city's commerce secretary, Edward Yau, told Reuters. Mexico was investigating a potential case. North Korea banned foreign tourists from Wednesday due to the virus, several foreign tour operators said, losing one of its main sources of foreign currency. Sport too was affected, with some qualifying boxing matches for the 2020 Olympics set for Wuhan canceled and women's football qualifiers shifted to Nanjing. China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the top legal authority, posted on Tuesday that anyone failing to report virus cases \"will be forever nailed to the pillar of historical shame .\" But despite such openness, some experts were skeptical. \"We have reason to doubt whether surv (surveillance) is adequate as cases mount,\" tweeted Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington.

Critics booed and chanted \"lock him up\" outside the courthouse, while supporters told <mark>Stone</mark> they were behind him. \"As I have always said, the only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about,\" <mark>Stone</mark> quipped. <mark>Stone</mark> and his attorney said <mark>Stone</mark> was innocent of the charges, which they called politically motivated, and said <mark>Stone</mark> would win in the end. \"I am falsely accused of making false statements to the House Intelligence Committee, that is incorrect,\" <mark>Stone</mark> said. \"Any error I made in my testimony would be both immaterial, and without intent .\" A grand jury indicted <mark>Stone</mark> on a total of seven counts. The 24-page indictment by the Special Counsel's Office accuses <mark>Stone</mark> of communicating with Wikileaks, at the direction of senior Trump campaign officials, on information Wikileaks might have that was potentially damaging to the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election. According to the indictment: \"After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1 [WikiLeaks], a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact <mark>STONE</mark> about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign .\" The indictment also claims that <mark>Stone</mark> had knowledge of Wikileaks email releases in October and communicated about them with a high-ranking member of the Trump campaign. The document also accuses <mark>Stone</mark> of trying to keep New York radio host Randy Credico from contradicting <mark>Stone</mark>'s testimony to the House intelligence committee, even repeatedly telling Credico to \"do a Frank Pentangeli,\" a reference to a character that lies to a Congressional committee in \"The Godfather: Part II .\" The indictment says <mark>Stone</mark> also threatened Credico, called him a \"rat\" or a \"stoolie\" and accused him of backstabbing his friends. <mark>Stone</mark> was arrested by the FBI in a raid early Friday morning at his Fort Lauderdale home. In video that aired on CNN, agents can be heard banging on the door and shouting \"FBI, open the door!\" <mark>Stone</mark>'s attorney railed against the FBI for the raid. \"The spectacle this morning with a SWAT team breaking into the house, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs, completely unnecessary. A telephone call would have done the job, and Mr. <mark>Stone</mark> would have appeared .\" <mark>Stone</mark>'s indictment and arrest culminates months of speculation about whether <mark>Stone</mark> would be impacted by the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. <mark>Stone</mark> has long denied he did anything wrong, has publicly criticized the Mueller investigation and said he would never turn on President Trump. <mark>Stone</mark>, a lawyer and self-proclaimed \"dirty trickster\" who has been involved with Republican politics since the Nixon administration, has known President Trump since 1979. In 2017, he told Spectrum News anchor Ybeth Bruzual that his discussions with a Wikileaks intermediary, now identified by the FBI as Guccifer 2.0, were innocuous. \"It's a fraud, there is nothing there,\" <mark>Stone</mark> said. \"There have never been any meaningful contacts between me, the Russian state, Russian intelligence, or anyone fronting for them, and I'm anxious to say that under oath .\" In February 2018, an indictment by the Special Counsel's Office found Guccifer 2.0 to be a persona operated by Russian intelligence. The Russian government denies this.
