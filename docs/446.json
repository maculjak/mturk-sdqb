Then Williams pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Charles in the chest, she said. Officers found Charles, 25, lying in the street outside his home on the 700 Block of Lincoln Street in the early hours of Aug. 28. He died at the scene. Williams, 40, who lives in an apartment in the 9500 block of 19th Bay Street, is charged with second degree murder and a related gun count. Based on Johnson's testimony, District Judge Clark Daugherty determined there was enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury and on a track toward trial. Williams is the father of Johnson's child, and he'd come to her place earlier that night to visit them, she told Daugherty. While he was over there, Johnson's new boyfriend--who was not Charles--stopped by. Johnson asked her boyfriend to get his stuff and leave, telling him their relationship was over. He left but refused to take his things with him. Later, Williams confronted Johnson's boyfriend on the street about not getting his stuff. Charles came down from his front lawn to tell them to take their argument elsewhere, Johnson said. Williams put his hands in the air. He backed up a few steps and Charles advanced. Then Williams pulled his gun and shot Charles, who fell to the ground, Johnson said. Williams then pistol-whipped Charles in the face. Johnson, who said she was standing next to Williams when he shot Charles, intervened to prevent him from shooting her boyfriend, who ran away. \"Get...off me!\" Williams told her before fleeing, Johnson said. Johnson said Williams didn't know any of the men who were out there, including Charles. Charles died from the gunshot, which hit him in the center chest, medical examiner Wendy Gunther said in her autopsy report. The bullet hit him in the heart, right lung and spine before coming out of his back. The blow above his left eyebrow broke his eye socket and cut a 1-inch gash in his head that went to the bone, Gunther said. Defense attorney <mark>Robert Smith</mark> III asked Johnson if Charles, her boyfriend or their friends jumped at or in any way hit Williams. \"They didn't put a hand on him,\" she said. <mark>Jonathan Edwards</mark>, 757-598-3453, jonathan.edwards @ pilotonline.com", "articleID": "2018032820_00048522_W", "names": {"Jonathan Edwards": ["Q16213939", "Q18719387", "Q19957695", "Q20656891", "Q22018231", "Q221648", "Q302892", "Q6273021", "Q629737"], "Robert Smith": ["Q16292920", "Q1632228", "Q19664222", "Q2158832", "Q23883691", "Q24006774", "Q25189961", "Q25189963", "Q27835064", "Q28803422", "Q29643608", "Q33996143", "Q3938426", "Q47127399", "Q491252", "Q54321482", "Q56528034", "Q59196504", "Q7348241", "Q7349869", "Q7349871", "Q7349872", "Q7349876", "Q7349878", "Q7349879", "Q7349881", "Q7349884", "Q7349886", "Q7349887", "Q7349888", "Q7349890"]}}, {"date": "2018-03-28", "url": "https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/former-drag-racer-panicked-sped-1396835", "content": "News Former drag racer panicked and sped off when he was caught speeding \"The next time the probation service says:\" Jump' you don't ask why, you say: \"How high?' .\" Share Comments By <mark>Jon Lewis</mark> Head of social media 21:28, 28 MAR 2018 News Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Share Comments Get Daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The population of Lake Michigan's top predator fish was well balanced with its primary food source in 2017, according to an annual estimate released last week by fisheries scientists. The news helped boost confidence in the future of the chinook salmon fishery even as the species' key forage, the alewife, is historically low. The predator-prey ratio (PPR) on Lake Michigan was 0.058 in 2017, according to a report presented March 22 at the Upper Lake Committees Meeting of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The PPR expresses the balance between chinook and alewife. Higher numbers indicate more predators than desired for the available prey. The target is 0.05, with 0.10 the upper limit. From 2013 to 2016, the values were 0.09, 0.06, 0.51 and 0.56, respectively. \"Overall, it's somewhat positive and encouraging to see the PPR come down from levels of five years ago,\" said Nick Legler, fisheries biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and chairman of the Lake Michigan Committee's Salmonid Working Group. Legler presented the latest chinook information on behalf of the group, which includes fisheries personnel with state agencies in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, American Indian tribes, Michigan State University, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Geological Survey. The data included creel survey information, annual forage assessments by acoustic and bottom trawls and fish examined at weirs.

In 2016, the Lake Michigan Committee of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission recommended a 62% chinook stocking reduction to help stave off a potentially serious imbalance. In the five years preceding a collapse of the chinook fishery in Lake Huron, the PPR averaged 0.11. Chinook stocking has been reduced multiple times over the decades in response to disease issues and declines in the forage base. The most recent cut was in 2013. But many anglers, including charter captains and members of the Wisconsin Lakeshore Business Association, pushed back in 2016 and convinced the Wisconsin DNR to keep chinook stocking level. Cuts were made instead to plants of brown trout and lake trout. The 2017 assessment of one annual benchmark--weight of a 3-year-old female chinook salmon--made it clear the fish were in good condition last year in Lake Michigan.

Visit on Facebook The data were obtained from 931 chinook gathered at seven spots around Lake Michigan, including the Root River in Racine and Strawberry Creek in Sturgeon Bay. . The 2017 lakewide average weight of a 3-year-old female chinook was 17.8 pounds, a 0.6 pound decrease from 2016 but 5.8 pounds higher than 2015. Significantly, the 2017 weight was 2.3 pounds higher than the long-term (1986-2017) average of 15.5 pounds. The most recent PPR and average chinook weight information validated observations of many Lake Michigan charter captains. \"That's the kind of the data I was expecting based on what I see on a day-to-day basis on the lake,\" said Jason Woda, 43, of Oak Creek, who owns and operates Reel Sensation Charters in Milwaukee. \"Many of us feel like there is more bait out there than the surveys have shown and that the fish are in good shape .\" Woda also serves as secretary of the Wisconsin Lakeshore Business Association, \"There was talk about cutting 500,000 chinook just a couple years ago,\" Woda said. \"That would have put a lot of ports out of business. We said we didn't want an increase, but let's put the brakes on any plans to cut chinook. This recent data shows that was a good decision .\" Chinook are not native to the Great Lakes but were introduced to Lake Michigan in the 1960s to help control nuisance levels of alewife, also a non-native species. Chinook are highly valued by anglers for their sport and table value. In Wisconsin, annual chinook stocking peaked at 2.7 million in 1989 and in recent years was 1.5 million in 2004, 1.17 million in 2006, 724,545 in 2008, 1.23 million in 2010, 1.18 million in 2012 and 823,222 in 2014, according to DNR records. A freshly caught Chinook salmon hauled in by Wendy Morris flops around on the dock in Port Washington. (Photo: <mark>Mark Hoffman</mark>, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) The most recent plans call for keeping chinook stocking in the 800,000 s. Managing the lake's trout and salmon fishery is complicated by natural reproduction of chinook, primarily in streams in Michigan. In recent years, about two-thirds of chinook sampled lake-wide were wild, or naturally reproduced, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Chinook are watched closely since they consume the most prey fish in the lake and rely most heavily on alewife. In 2017, chinook consumed 47 kilotonnes of forage fish, compared to 21 for steelhead, 19 for lake trout, 8 for brown trout and 4 for coho, according to the report. The recent data and estimates have helped allay fears that a Lake Huron-like collapse was imminent on Lake Michigan. Fisheries scientists will continue to keep a close eye on the lake, however, and caution that year-to-year swings can be substantial. Legler pointed out that the lake's alewife biomass is at a record low, PPR is slightly above target and there has been a slight upward trend over the last three years. \"The goal is to sustain the great fishery that's out there,\" said Brad Eggold, WDNR Lake Michigan fisheries manager. \"It's clear management actions have helped in the past and we're committed to working with our partners and stakeholders around the lake to continue that into the future, too .\" Top Headlines from Sports: Ji-Man Choi is a surprise on the Brewers' opening day roster Bevy of topics on minds of Packers' <mark>Mark Murphy</mark>, NFL Chase Anderson evolved into complete starter CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "articleID": "2018032903_00138570_W", "names": {"Mark Hoffman": ["Q26935179", "Q56636102"], "Mark Murphy": ["Q1900301", "Q2340169", "Q3294194", "Q6768972", "Q6768973", "Q6768974", "Q933550"]}}, {"date": "2018-03-29", "url": "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/la-me-ln-essential-california-20180329-story.html#nt=oft11aH-15li2", "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter.

Now he campaigns for Butler County Commission, running against incumbent Commissioner Cindy Carpenter for the GOP nomination in the May 8 primary. He has since upgraded from his bike to a small Segway which allows him to go door-to-door faster. And that one-on-one contact with voters is at the heart of his campaign. \"People see this as shoe-leather politics, going door-to-door, and people see that you are hard-working and honest,\" said Wong. But being a politician, and in campaigning, Wong said he has developed a thick skin. \"I've been to some houses, they've slammed the door on me,\" he said. \"It's life; you have to have thick skin .\" This month, this news organization is profiling the two candidates vying for the Republican nomination in the Butler County Commission race.

This area (in the Four Bridges neighborhood), they pay over $10,000 (a year).\" He said there needs to be some control on the levies because people are paying too much. \"In West Chester, we stretch the levies. Our police levy, we'll stretch a five-year levy for five or 10 more years,\" he said. \"You've got to stretch it .\" Some, including Carpenter, have questioned Wong for running for an office just months after winning an election. But Wong said as a probation officer with Butler County, he could not seek a partisan office. He's since retired, and also said, \"I have enough experience to do it for the larger office .\" But this is the largest office Wong said he intends to seek, saying, \"I want to stay local .\" \"This is where I would serve best,\" he said. \"I'm a people person. I get out and people know me. Most of the people have seen me before .\" Wong did unsuccessfully attempt to seek the Butler County GOP's recommendation to succeed former lawmaker Margy Conditt as the 52nd Ohio House District appointment this past September. The Ohio House appointed former West Chester Twp. Trustee <mark>George Lang</mark> to that seat.
