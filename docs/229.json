MORE Sure, a lot of people love \"Game of Thrones .\" But it wasn't that long ago that the whole swords-and-sorcery thing was a one-way ticket to social ostracism. Or maybe it was the only way out. Either way, it sure seems as though the geeks have inherited the earth. At the risk of making an epic overstatement, the redemptive power of geek culture is the heart of a new stage comedy called \"She Kills Monsters,\" which is getting its Arizona premiere from Glendale's Brelby Theatre Company. \"It's kind of about how nerds as a whole have gone on this journey from being underdogs to now being kind of cool,\" says company co-founder Shelby Maticic. Written by New York playwright and fight director <mark>Qui Nguyen</mark>, \"She Kills Monsters\" is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, the role-playing game from the 1970s that has spawned countless imitators, from old-school dice-and-paper play to mega-popular online RPGs such as World of Warcraft. It's a bittersweet comedy about a schoolteacher named Agnes who loses her family but comes to know her kid sister through the fantastical world she created within the game. \"Obviously the show speaks to nerds and has this incredible quest and really intense battle sequences and monsters that we get to play with onstage,\" says Brian Maticic, the show's director (and Shelby's husband). \"But what it comes down to is the theme of escapism, the chance to live that fantasy that you can't have in real life, but also mixed with the personal growth of the main character. It follows her through the grieving process but also her own self-discovery as she learns about who her sister was and who she is as a person .\" Shelby Maticic, who is also the company's artistic director, will play Agnes. \"It's this beautiful journey of her getting to know a sister that she never paid attention to,\" Shelby says. \"She ends up kind of building a new family along the way out of the characters that she meets through the Dungeons & Dragons world, who all actually have real-world counterparts. They were all members of Tilly's gaming circle .\" It's a really sweet, kind of sad show, but it's perfectly balanced with some seriously epic fight sequences as they play out the quest onstage \"- including a climax involving a five-headed dragon puppet. Quite literally a mom-and-pop operation, Brelby doesn't have the resources for a lot of fancy special effects, but the company does what it can to add pizzazz to its productions, as when it did up Oscar Wilde's\" The Importance of Being Earnest \"in steampunk style, complete with giant working cogwheels as part of the stage .\" We have a really intimate studio, but I think we've gotten pretty creative about finding ways to surprise the audience with tech elements, \"Shelby says. Founded in 2009, Brelby Theatre has cultivated a younger audience - college age to young parents - with an eclectic mix that includes the occasional classic drama or Broadway musical but also less-known works by contemporary playwrights, including local writers.

(AP Photo/Wally Santana, File) Wally Santana WASHINGTON (AP)--President Donald Trump says that electronics giant Foxconn will build a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin that's expected to initially create 3,000 jobs, the largest economic development project in state history. The announcement Wednesday comes at a critical juncture for a Trump administration that pledged to generate manufacturing jobs but has struggled to deliver results as quickly as the president promised. Trump's plans for health care and tax cuts face a murky future in Congress, while his administration is bogged down by an investigation into Russia's possible ties with his presidential campaign. In a White House speech, Trump said the financial commitment by Foxconn CEO Terry Gou was a direct result of his electoral win. \"If I didn't get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion,\" Trump said. \"We are going to have some very, very magnificent decades .\" But the decision to build the plant in Wisconsin also stemmed from $3 billion in state economic incentives over 15 years if Foxconn invests $10 billion in the state and ultimately adds 13,000 jobs. The incentives would only be awarded if Foxconn creates the jobs and pays an average salary of nearly $54,000. The Wisconsin factory, scheduled to be open by 2020, would be massive. The campus dubbed \"Wisconn Valley,\" would cover nearly 1.6 square miles and be three times the size of the Pentagon. Foxconn's plant will produce liquid-crystal display panels, or LCDs, that are used in televisions and computer screens. The factory will be located in the congressional district of House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>. It would mark a substantial gain for a state that currently has 472,000 manufacturing jobs and is still recovering from factory layoffs--including the closure of a General Motors plant in <mark>Ryan</mark>'s hometown--that hit after the 2008 financial crisis. Taiwan-based Foxconn is perhaps best known for assembling Apple iPhones in China. The company noted in a statement that having the Wisconsin factory would help it better serve the major U.S. technology companies that are its clients. Inside the White House, discussions with Foxconn about opening a U.S. plant were led over several months by Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and the president's son-in-law, and Reed Cordish, an assistant to the president on technology initiatives. The president had met personally with Gou, who on Wednesday complimented Trump's leadership at the event by saying, \"Mr. President, the eagle flies .\" Seven states had competed for the Foxconn plant. By awarding the plant to Wisconsin, Foxconn would appear to be giving a victory to both Trump and the state's Republican governor, <mark>Scott Walker</mark>, who is up for re-election next year. Other states that vied for the plant are Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Foxconn said in a release the announcement was just the first of several investments the company will be making in the U.S. <mark>Walker</mark> and several other Wisconsin officials, including <mark>Ryan</mark>, attended the White House announcement. Landing the multistate competition has been cast as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Foxconn is the biggest contract assembler of smartphones and other devices for Apple and other brands. It has been eyeing building the plant in a part of Wisconsin represented by <mark>Ryan</mark>, who said he has met with company officials at <mark>Walker</mark>'s request. Critics have cautioned that Foxconn has made promises before to invest in the U.S. and not followed through. Foxconn promised in 2013, for example, to invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new, high-tech factory in Pennsylvania that was never built. State Sen. Alberta Darling, co-chair of the Wisconsin Legislature's budget committee, said any deal would be examined with a \"fine-toothed comb\" and need to win approval by the Republican-controlled Legislature. <mark>Walker</mark> said he planned to call a special legislative session to consider the incentives. They include up to $1.5 billion in income tax credits for job creation, $1.35 billion in income tax credits for capital investment and up to $150 million in a sales tax exemption for the purchase of construction materials. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is from <mark>Ryan</mark>'s congressional district in southeast Wisconsin, told WTMJ-TV on Tuesday that Trump, when flying over the area in Kenosha County during a visit to Wisconsin in April, noticed vacant land where a former Chrysler Motors plant used to be. \"He said,\" That land should be used,' \"Priebus said .\" So when Foxconn came into the White House, into the Oval Office, the president said,' I know a good spot that you should go to, that place in Kenosha .' \"That part of the state is an attractive location for a large plant because of the area's proximity to Lake Michigan and its abundant water supply. To make flat-panel displays, the company will need access to great quantities of water to keep work spaces dust-free, among other things. The news sent a jolt of excitement across Wisconsin, even among longtime Democratic critics of <mark>Walker</mark>.\" It's an exciting opportunity, \"said Democratic state Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca. Barca, like many Democrats, voiced concern about how much taxpayers may have to contribute in tax breaks and other incentives .\" We want to make sure it's a fair deal for everybody, \"he said .\" We want a win-win-win. \"---- --"}, {"articleID": "2019092810_00067180_W", "names": {"Mohammed Ali": ["Q16002506", "Q6854083"]}, "date": "2019-09-28", "url": "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190928-sisi-hints-at-using-popular-mandate-to-deter-protesters/", "content": "Sisi hints at using popular mandate to deter protesters September 28, 2019 at 11:05 am | Published in: Africa, Egypt, News Egyptian President Abdel fattah Al-Sisi chairs the closing session of the first joint European Union and Arab League summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, on 25 February, 2019 [MOHAMED EL-SHAHED/AFP/Getty Images] September 28, 2019 at 11:05 am The Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi hinted on Friday that he is to use popular mandate to crackdown on the protesters calling for him to resign, AlKhaleejonline.com reported.
