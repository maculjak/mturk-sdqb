Health bosses from both the Western Sussex Hospital Trust and Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which awarded Bupa CSH Ltd a \u00a3 235m musculoskeletal (MSK) contract, were before West Sussex County Council's Health and Social Care committee on Friday December 5. An independent impact assessment into the decision was jointly commissioned by the Trust and CCG after Western bosses went public with fears that its accident and emergency units at Chichester's St Richard's Hospital and Worthing Hospital could suffer as a result of the deal. Both are used by South Downs residents. One question asked by GP and committee vice chairman Dr <mark>James Walsh</mark> was why private procurement was chosen over public bidders. Marie Dodd, the CCG's chief operations officer, said legal advice made it clear there was \"no other option' but to offer the services out to tender. She said:\" The CCG (sought legal guidance) and reluctantly had to accept the advice that procurement was going to be the best vehicle, and the required vehicle for us to use in those circumstances. \"Dr Katie Armstrong, chief officer at the CCG, said a summary of the assessment would be made public once both bodies had studied it in full. The results will be shared with committee members ahead of HASC's next meeting on January 21, 2015. Committee's chairman, <mark>Margaret Evans</mark>, said:\" We will look very closely at the impact assessment's results as the MSK contract has been a matter of significant concern to the committee and to the public. * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.

Now 21, Bieber recently underwent a dramatic transformation that changed his persona and the public's perception of the pop star. But reflecting on the past of his protegee and client, Scooter reveals that Justin could have died at one point, revealed the Mirror. Braun has managed Bieber for years, but only now is the pop idol's manager ready to share the struggles that, during one particularly dark period, were life-threatening. How serious were those past problems? Scooter shared that after a tidal wave of bad publicity that hit Justin hard, Braun would not allow his client to tour. That ban occurred in 2013, following the release of the Journals album. Scooter Braun and Justin Bieber are pals as well as manager and client. [Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images] \"I was not going to let him work. He wanted to tour, and I honestly at that time felt, if he toured, he could die,\" Braun said. Scooter admits that the outside world had no idea what was going on in Bieber's life. Braun also made it clear that he won't tell the full story because he's waiting for Bieber to share when he's ready. \"The outsiders don't really know what was happening. It was far worse than people realize. and when he is ready, he will tell what he was going through. But it's a hard thing to watch someone you care and genuinely love go through that. I'm really, really happy that's over,\" emphasized Scooter. Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun share a sense of humor. [Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Dolce & Gabbana] In addition, Braun recalled a turning point in the career of his client, crediting an intern in his office for coming up with the milestone event. It happened when Scooter held a staff meeting, encouraging his employees to suggest ideas for a thorough interview. Although Braun suggested famous talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey and Katie Couric, a 21-year-old Ava Coleman, then an intern, suggested something very different. \"I just think my generation doesn't care about that,\" said Ava in response to the suggestions of Oprah and Katie. \"I think if you want people to see that he's for real, he should do a Comedy Central roast.\" Scooter proclaimed it a genius concept, and just one day later engaged Comedy Central in a phone conversation. With <mark>Kevin Hart</mark> taking on the role of host and utilizing his comedic talents, the Comedy Central roast proposed by that intern and embraced as a great idea by Scooter proved to be the turning point that saved Bieber's career by revealing his humility and sense of humor.

Braun did not go into detail himself just yet, noted the Daily Mail. Just like his client, Scooter is modest. Braun admitted that he feels in some ways he failed when it came to helping the young pop star turn around his life. Scooter recognizes that the intense marketing program has made an impression, but he praises the 21-year-old for making the decision to undergo a life-changing--and potentially life-saving--transformation. \"I know people have seen the marketing and the A & R and everything we put together, and they're like,\" Wow, great job!' But I want to be really clear: I was trying to do that job for a year and a half, and I failed every single day. It wasn't until something happened that it clicked for him. He made the conscious decision as a young man: \"I need to make a change in my own life .'\" Braun also maintains an active Twitter account, sharing tidbits from his life as well as those of the clients he manages and, as shown with Bieber, genuinely cares about. And his mini-bio on Twitter reveals that Braun believes in the importance of family and friends. \"Family and friends are everything. I live life and try and smile as much as possible. Inspire the world to try!\" urges Scooter.

(AP) Cameroon has acknowledged that more than two dozen Boko Haram suspects died in custody late last year, but a government spokesman denied the country's army was carrying out regular human rights abuses in its crackdown on the extremist group. Ikea pulls magazine site in Russia Seven dead in Serb helicopter crash The 25 suspects were found dead in their cell a day after being arrested in December, communications minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. They were part of a group of 56 detainees and the cause of their deaths is still being determined, he said. \"I can already state here that at this stage of investigation no evidence has been established to corroborate that these persons were deliberately killed,\" Mr Bakary said. He added that a senior military official had been removed from his post and was being investigated over the deaths, though he did not identify the person by name. In January, the Network of Human Rights Defenders in Central Africa, based in the capital Yaounde, cited \"reliable sources\" in claiming that 50 Boko Haram suspects had suffocated to death in their cells before being buried in a mass grave. The group's report accused the army of engaging in rights violations including torture \"with impunity\" . Boko Haram has been fighting a near six-year insurgency against the Nigerian government, killing thousands and carrying out mass kidnappings, including of schoolgirls. The conflict has taken on an increasingly international dimension in recent months. Cameroon's northern region was repeatedly targeted by Boko Haram before the country signed up to participate in a multinational force that has dislodged the group from a score of north-eastern Nigerian towns in recent weeks. Nigeria has acknowledged it is getting help from regional security operatives amid reports that South Africa and other foreign contractors are involved in the fight against Boko Haram.

Austin M. Mitchener, 19, East North Street, made a court appearance before Circuit Judge Paul Mangieri Thursday afternoon on a motion to reduce bail. His bail was set at $500,000, $50,000 needed to get out of jail, in an arrest warrant on one count of Class X felony aggravated battery to a child. That charge says Mitchener allegedly bounced a child \"on his lap without supporting the (victim's) neck, causing blood and swelling on the brain and/or seizures and/or shaken baby syndrome.\" If Mitchener is convicted, the charge carries a sentence of between six and 30 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, which would be served at 85 percent. It is not eligible for probation. Mitchener is represented by defense attorney Jeremy Karlin. Knox County Assistant State's Attorney <mark>Brian Kerr</mark> successfully filed a motion to continue Mitchener's preliminary hearing one week to begin Thursday's court appearance. That led to the bond hearing, in which Karlin called Melania Mitchener to testify. She said she is Mitchener's stepmother. She has become a foster parent for the child in the case, who is now 2 1/2 months old, through the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. The child was released from an area hospital last Friday, July 7. Karlin requested bail be lowered to $10,000, and Melania Mitchener said she could post the $1,000 that would be needed to get Austin Mitchener out of the Knox County jail. Even if he were to get out of jail, she said she understood he was to have no contact with the victim while the child's mother has supervised visits with a DCFS representative present. <mark>Kerr</mark> read from the Galesburg police report related to the incident to make an argument against reducing bail. He said Galesburg police received a call for a suspicious injury report on June 23 involving a child with blood on her brain, which came from non-accidental head trauma. A doctor said it was shaken baby syndrome and that the child was suffering from seizures and the swelling on her brain caused her brain to shift, <mark>Kerr</mark> said. It was not initially expected that the baby would survive, but she has subsequently recovered. The doctor ruled there was \"no other possible explanation other than some form of child abuse\" that caused the injuries, <mark>Kerr</mark> said in court Thursday afternoon. He further said Mitchener said he had anger issues growing up and would get frustrated when the child would not calm down. In those instances, he would hand the baby off to her mother. Early June 21, he took care of the child and was attempting to calm her down while the child's mother slept. He reportedly bounced the baby on his knee and chest without supporting the baby's neck. \"Shortly after bouncing her is when she went limp,\" which Mitchener thought was her going to sleep, <mark>Kerr</mark> told Mangieri in court. At that point, he reportedly lay the girl down and then checked on her a few hours later and found her twitching. Later that morning, the child was taken to the emergency room, <mark>Kerr</mark> said. Mangieri elected to cut Mitchener's bail in half from $500,000 to $250,000, $25,000 needed to get out of jail. That amount was believed to be too high for him to be able to post, according to testimony heard Thursday afternoon. Mitchener will return to court at 2 p.m. Thursday for his preliminary hearing.

The World Cup winning captain played for Nice and Lyon before arriving at Spurs and has more than 100 caps under his belt. At the fairly ripe age of 31 Lloris has faced a wealth of attacking talent throughout his career, but the best forward he's come up against is neither of the five-time Ballon d'Or winners. Instead, the Spurs shot-stopper named Real Madrid and Spain legend Raul.

Back in the day, there was also Pauleta at Paris Saint-Germain. I played him a lot when I was at Nice. \"The Spain forward scored 323 goals in 741 appearances for Los Blancos and 44 in 102 caps for Spain.

Illinois Historic Preservation Agency Director Amy Martin said Wednesday that the agency is working on specifics and will attempt to maintain hours as much as possible at the most popular sites, including Abraham Lincoln sites. More than 1.3 million people visited eight state historic sites in Springfield and Petersburg in 2013, according to agency figures. \"We wanted to make it through the Labor Day holiday to accommodate people who have travel plans,\" Martin said after an Illinois Tourism Office event at Dana-Thomas House in Springfield. \"We're looking at trying to target it so that it's not all 26 sites.\" The agency budget for historic site operations was cut by $1.1 million for the fiscal year that started July 1, or 19 percent below the previous year. Martin said post-Labor Day hours also would take into account traditional fall visits by school groups. \"We have so many school groups coming in, and we don't want to affect those,\" Martin said. \"Teachers plan those so far in advance as well.\" Agency spokesman <mark>Chris Wills</mark> said discussions continue with legislative leaders for restoration of the $1.1 million early next year. \"That's what they cut, and that's what we would hope they'd put back,\" <mark>Wills</mark> said. \"It's not like we're going back to a level that would be an improvement.\" State Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, told The State Journal-Register editorial board last month that restoration of historic site funding should be a priority. <mark>Wills</mark> said lawmakers likely would not act on the restoration request until January. Lincoln's New Salem State Historic Site in Petersburg was the busiest local historic site in 2013 with more than 376,000 visitors, followed by a little more than 358,000 visitors at the Lincoln Tomb, and 321,000 at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. *** Historic site visits in 2013 * Lincoln's New Salem State Historic Site: 376,463 * Lincoln Tomb: 358,142 * Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum: 321,071 * War Memorials: 152,040 * Old State Capitol: 109,687 * Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices: 29,066 * Dana-Thomas House: 23,893 * Vachel Lindsay Home: 3,530 Source: Illinois Historic Preservation Agency Contact Tim Landis: 788-1536, tim.landis @ sj-r.com, twitter.com/timlandisSJR."}]
