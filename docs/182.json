sudden sex scandal, president barack obama said wednesday he's seen no evidence that national security was damaged by the revelations that ended his cia director's career and imperil that of his afghan war commander. but the president said he is reserving judgment about how the fbi has handled the investigation that began in the summer but didn't reach his desk until after last week's election. \"i have a lot of confidence, generally, in the fbi,\" obama said, qualifying his words of support for the agency and its actions in the case. as obama spoke about the scandal from the white house, legislators on capitol hill were grilling fbi and cia officials privately about the same issues: whether national security was jeopardized by the case and why they didn't know about the investigation sooner. \"i have no evidence at this point, from what i've seen, that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,\" obama said at his first postelection news conference. as for the fbi's handling of the matter, obama said: \"my expectation is that they follow the protocols that they've already established. one of the challenges here is that we're not supposed to meddle in criminal investigations, and that's been our practice .\" federal law enforcement officials have said the fbi didn't inform the white house and congress sooner about the original investigation because of rules set up after the watergate scandal to prevent interference in criminal investigations and that lawmakers weren't given notice of potential national security problems because the bureau had quickly resolved them. cia director david petraeus resigned friday, two days after the white house was notified that he'd acknowledged having an affair with his biographer, paula broadwell. the fbi's investigation of the matter began last summer when tampa, fla., socialite jill kelley turned over anonymous emails that had been sent to her and gen. <mark>john allen</mark>, the top u.s. commander in afghanistan. the first anonymous email was sent to <mark>allen</mark> in may, under the pseudonym \"kelleypatrol,\" and he forwarded it to kelley. that email warned <mark>allen</mark> to stay away from kelley, according to a person close to kelley who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the emails is ongoing. that same email - later traced to broadwell - said the writer knew about a future meeting <mark>allen</mark> and kelley had scheduled. <mark>allen</mark> thought the email was a joke or that it was possibly from kelley because he didn't know how anyone else would know about their planned meeting, the person close to kelley said. kelley was a friend of <mark>allen</mark> and petraeus, both of whom she had met in tampa when the men served there. one of the federal law enforcement officials confirmed wednesday that fbi agents were concerned that somebody was tracking the movements of <mark>allen</mark> and petraeus, raising the possibility of a national security breach. kelley's complaints about the threatening emails triggered the fbi investigation that led to the resignation of petraeus and the inquiry into her communications with <mark>allen</mark>. officials said broadwell apparently saw kelley as a rival for petraeus' affections. the official also said wednesday that broadwell sent emails to a couple of other senior military officials besides petraeus and <mark>allen</mark>. the official characterized the emails as an attempt to undermine kelley's reputation. the fbi found a substantial number of classified documents on broadwell's computer, and she has told agents that took classified documents out of secure government buildings, according to the official. on monday, the fbi also found classified documents in the search of broadwell's house in charlotte, n.c., the official said. broadwell had agreed to the search and had told agents in advance that there would be more of them there. a lawyer for <mark>allen</mark> released a statement promising the general would cooperate fully with the defense department inspector general's investigation. \"to the extent that there are questions about certain communications by general <mark>allen</mark>, he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible,\" said col. <mark>john baker</mark>, chief defense counsel of the marine corps. <mark>allen</mark> has denied any wrongdoing. in early june, kelley herself received the first of as many as five emails sent from different anonymous accounts alleging that she was up to no good, the person close to kelley said. one of those mentioned petraeus by name. by the end of june or early july, kelley contacted an fbi agent in tampa she had met at least a year earlier, which began the agency's investigation of the matter. the new york times identified the agent as frederick w. humphries, 47, a veteran counterterrorism investigator in the tampa office. kelley met humphries when she attended the bureau's citizens' academy, an fbi program aimed at showing members of the public at least some of what the fbi does and how it works, the person close to kelley said. officials who have seen the communications between <mark>allen</mark> and kelley on wednesday described some of the emails as \"suggestive,\" and said their release would be embarrassing for the general. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly. with broadwell and kelley suddenly in the center of the storm, small details suddenly became topics for discussion. word surfaced wednesday that kelley's pass to enter macdill air force base in florida had been indefinitely suspended, a decision made at the base level. pentagon spokesman lt. col. steven warren said kelley still can enter the base but must report to the visitor center and sign in like others without a pass. separately, a u.s. official said the army has suspended broadwell's security clearance. as a former army intelligence officer, she held a high security clearance. the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. broadwell, who lives in charlotte, n.c., was spotted in washington at her brother's home late tuesday. her listing in her high school yearbook in bismarck, n.d., as \"most likely to be remembered\" took on new meaning. fbi director robert mueller and deputy director sean joyce met privately with legislators on both sides of the capitol on wednesday to explain how the investigation unfolded. they met first with senate intelligence committee chairwoman dianne feinstein, d-calif., and ranking republican saxby chambliss of georgia, then crossed the capitol to meet with the house intelligence committee. acting cia director michael morell went before the house panel next, after meeting a day earlier with top senate intelligence officials to explain the cia's take on events that led to petraeus' resignation. the questioning on capitol hill will continue on thursday. rep. dutch ruppersberger, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said a hearing scheduled for thursday to explore the government's handling of the attacks on the u.s. consulate in benghazi, libya, also would touch on the petraeus affair, covering how and why the fbi investigation was started. he said mueller, joyce and morell only began to answer those questions wednesday. \"how did you get the information, what's the basis for the investigation, who did you talk to, were you working with prosecutors, all those issues have to be looked at,\" including why the intelligence committees weren't told of the investigation until just before petraeus' resignation, he said. petraeus will testify friday before the house intelligence committee about libya, panel spokeswoman susan phalen said. lawmakers are also concerned over reports that broadwell had classified information on her laptop, though fbi investigators say they concluded there was no security breach. fbi agents who contacted petraeus told him that sensitive, possibly classified documents related to afghanistan were found on her computer, the general's associates said. he assured investigators they did not come from him, and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there. one associate also said petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified, although they might have still been marked \"secret .\" feinstein, asked by reporters if there was a national security breach with the petraeus affair, said she had \"no evidence that there was at this time .\" feinstein said that petraeus himself would testify before congress - but not about the affair. she said he had agreed to appear to talk about the libya attack on sept. 11 that killed the u.s. ambassador and three other americans, but she said no date had been set. <mark>allen</mark> has been allowed to stay in his job as commander of the afghan war, providing a leading voice in white house discussions on how many troops will remain in afghanistan - and for what purposes - after the u.s.-led combat operation ends in 2014. but obama has put on hold <mark>allen</mark>'s nomination to become the next commander of u.s. european command as well as the nato supreme allied commander in europe until pentagon investigators are able to sift through the 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails that involve <mark>allen</mark> and kelley. defense secretary leon panetta, at a news conference in perth, australia, said, \"no one should leap to any conclusions\" about <mark>allen</mark>, and said he is fully confident in <mark>allen</mark>'s ability to continue to lead in afghanistan. he added that putting a hold on <mark>allen</mark>'s european command nomination was the \"prudent\" thing to do.", "articleID": "2012111501_00072203_W", "names": {"John Baker":

eurozone slips into recession bartholomeusz: myer eyes a christmas miracle greek protesters break into conference aap dozens of anti-austerity protesters have broken into a conference centre in northern greece and clashed with police. the protesting municipal workers pushed and threw coffee on a german diplomat who arrived to attend the conference of greek and german mayors being held in the city of thessaloniki. they later forced open shutters and entered the conference center, where they clashed with riot police. a german deputy labour minister who has been appointed special envoy to greece, hans-joachim fuchtel, was also attending the event. \"these people haven't come here to help us, but to announce our death sentence,\" said themis balasopoulos, leader of greece's municipal workers union, who was at thursday's demonstration. the protesters chanted \"nazis out\" and \"this will not pass\" as they tried to obstruct municipal officials from attending the conference. germany is the biggest contributor to greece's rescue loans and has been one of the most vocal advocates of the tough austerity measures demanded of athens. as a result, protesters in greece often target germany in their demonstrations. last month, around 50,000 people demonstrated in athens when german chancellor angela merkel paid her first official visit to greece since the country's massive debt crisis broke out. she expressed support for the conservative-led government's efforts to limit high budget deficits. the greek parliament last week passed a new austerity package that bailout creditors had demanded in exchange for paying out more rescue loans. the package raised the retirement age and cut pensions and raised taxes. it has also has eased restrictions on firing workers. in a chaotic scene on thursday, riot police chased protesters through the conference centre complex from building to building. there were no immediate reports of arrests. the protesters played nazi anthems over loud speakers, as well as greek radio recordings from world war two. left-wing german mp <mark>annette groth</mark> joined the protesters outside the conference centre, where clashes with riot police also occurred. to contribute your comments for possible publication, please list being compiled. please try again later. contact details business spectator 22 william street melbourne victoria

batch, who was far from elite but at least outplayed joe flacco in the steelers' win in baltimore. but no one was expecting greatness. batch just gave more of what he's offered these past 10 years as pittsburgh's backup (or third-string) quarterback: a steady, capable option under center, who'll give you a chance to win at least some of the games he's forced into starting. you can't ask for much more. he's really old, though. batch turns 38 on wednesday, making him the same age as long-gone signal callers like jake plummer, danny wuerffel, and jake delhomme. for a sense of perspective, batch's main safety valve as a rookie was throwing dump passes to a running back named <mark>barry sanders</mark>. 1998 was <mark>sanders</mark>'s last year in the league, and batch's first. after setting nearly every passing record at eastern michigan, he became an instant local favorite when he was drafted by the lions in the second round. after two games, <mark>scott mitchell</mark> couldn't get it done, so the lions turned the reins over to batch. and in his second career start-a monday night game against the buccaneers-batch recorded his first win, thanks in large part to <mark>sanders</mark>. this, despite tampa bay explicitly promising they were going to force batch to beat them. \"i think we're going to have to [focus on <mark>sanders</mark>],\" tony dungy said. \"the focus is always <mark>barry sanders</mark> when you play them, and we've got to really do a good job on him and not let him get going. if we can get ahead of them, get in a mode like minnesota was, where once they got up now you're just turning everything you've got loose at the quarterback, it's going to be tough on a rookie quarterback - whether it's charlie batch or ryan leaf. peyton manning, the same thing .\" so we've really got to concentrate on <mark>barry</mark> and make sure that we don't let him get going, and then make the quarterback throw. \"it didn't matter. watch some of the batch-to-sanders highlights above (all taken from this youtube video); even an inexperienced qb and a prepared defense couldn't stop <mark>sanders</mark> from doing his thing. <mark>sanders</mark> rushed 27 times and put up 175 all-purpose yards, while batch went 14-for-23 for 115 yards. batch added his first career score, running for a one-yard touchdown, as the lions won 27-6. <mark>sanders</mark> would unexpectedly retire after the season, and detroit's run game went in the tank. in response, batch was asked to become more of a running quarterback than he was comfortable being, and that led directly to a series of injuries. he missed multiple games each of his remaining three years in detroit, and wasn't re-signed after the 2001 season. the hybrid style he had adopted served him well-he was signed to the steelers by gm kevin colbert, who had scouted and drafted him for the lions. he was the ideal backup to then-pittsburgh qb kordell stewart-if\" slash \"went down, batch could enter as a scrambling qb without the team missing a beat. stewart's gone, as are tommy maddox and dennis dixon, but batch remains. ben roethlisberger's stand-up style of play is different, but he's just as prone to injury-in 2005, when roethlisberger went down midseason, batch stepped in and went 2-0. in a year in which 10-6 wasn't good enough to make the afc playoffs, the steelers finished 11-5 and went on to win super bowl xl.", "articleID": "2012120414_00029237_W", "names": {"Barry Sanders": ["Q809092", "Q809097"], "Scott Mitchell": ["Q7436881", "Q7436882",

of their daughter, ms. don and barb horan and another couple died when a small plane, piloted by don horan, crashed sunday near greensburg, ind., airport. / <mark>sean gallagher</mark>, the criterion/file by ryan sabalow and jill disis, the indianapolis star lifelong friends and their wives died over the weekend in a plane crash, a tragedy that has left this small community reeling as federal investigators try to determine why the single-engine plane went down at about 6:20 p.m. sunday. late monday, officials confirmed what family and friends feared when authorities found four bodies in wreckage strewn across nearly 3 acres of fog-covered farmland southeast of the airport here. donald horan, 46, a licensed pilot and businessman known for donating generously to his church and the state's catholic archdiocese, and his wife, barbara, 44, were killed. they had four daughters, now in their teens and 20s. the crash also killed stephen butz, 45, and his wife, denise, 42. they had two teenage sons .\" they leave behind six beautiful children who are hurting and grieving over the loss of their parents, \"brian wenning, a friend of the families, said monday at a news conference. the two men went to the same grade school together. they worshipped together at st. mary catholic church. their families vacationed together. they coached their children's sports teams together. the two couples had spent the weekend in destin, fla., on the gulf of mexico where the horans owned a five-bedroom home. they flew to florida from here friday evening. three other greensburg, ind., couples, including donald's brother, tom horan, and his wife, suzanne, also flew to florida in a separate plane, piloted by <mark>todd reed</mark> of greensburg. the two planes departed florida on sunday afternoon, and encountered a thick blanket of fog as they approached their small, home airport. the national transportation safety board is heading the investigation, which is likely to include a focus on weather conditions sunday .\" the conditions that night were horrible, \"said jon dooley, vice president of the greensburg board of aviation commissioners .\" it was such that an aircraft wouldn't have seen the runway unless they were very close. \"dooley said <mark>reed</mark> tried to land at the airport before horan's plane arrived about 45 minutes later. but <mark>reed</mark> missed his approach, dooley said. he said that normally means the pilot couldn't see the runway. the plane diverted to the airport in columbus, ind., a larger, better-equipped facility with a tower about 30 miles southwest. it landed safely. horan's plane continued on to the greensburg airport. the weather at that time\" would have been similar or, if anything, even worse \"than when <mark>reed</mark> decided to divert to columbus, dooley said. horan, who earlier this year earned an instrument rating that allowed him to fly at night and in low-visibility situations, had bought the plane he was flying in october, dooley said. greensburg police detective william meyerrose said federal crash investigators were expected to examine the crash site tuesday. he said it would be up to them to determine why the plane went down. meyerrose declined to say whether it's believed weather was a factor. but capt. lindsay shipps, a spokeswoman for the civil air patrol, said it was so foggy sunday night that weather conditions kept searchers grounded as they looked for wreckage. the fog was dense across the state that night and only pilots such as horan, licensed for instrument-only flying, could take off and land at airports, she said. as federal investigators headed to the crash monday afternoon, those who knew the victims shared stories of generosity and kindness - and loss. childhood friend mark burkert said the horans would host get-togethers at their house, not just for family friends but virtually for everyone .\" you never know who you're going to meet over there, from some highly influential people to common people, \"burkert said .\" he was always willing to have people over. don never met a stranger. \"burkert also said he never saw horan and butz without smiles on their faces .\" he could be having the worst day of his life, \"burkert said of horan,\" and you would never know it. \"mark schabel, the chief executive of the greensburg company that horan founded, receivables management partners, said horan loved to fly and often took his friends on trips. horan had bought the piper so he could fly at night, schabel said. in 2007, horan stepped down from day-to-day involvement at the company, which provides account and billing services to businesses involved in the health-care industry. that gave horan more time to support catholic causes, including for the archdiocese of indianapolis. his philanthropy also extended to his home parish, which he supported with a sizable contribution to the new st. mary catholic school here .\" don is a fantastic guy, \"said paul walston, 84, who lived near the horans .\" his whole family is great. \"greg otolski, a spokesman for the archdiocese of indianapolis, confirmed horan's generous contributions to the st. mary catholic school and other church causes .\" a year ago, st. mary's catholic school in greensburg built a new school, probably an $8 million project, \"otolski said .\" i don't know how much specifically don contributed to that, but he and his wife were significant donors and actively involved with efforts to raise funds there. \"the archdiocese's auxiliary bishop, <mark>christopher j. coyne</mark>, said the horans\" have been very active in serving their parish and the greater archdiocese over the years. \"\"they traveled to every corner of the archdiocese to raise funds for ministry needs,\" <mark>coyne</mark> said. horan also was a member of the board of directors of the catholic community foundation and served as president of the foundation in 2011. the foundation oversees 407 endowments with nearly $138 million in assets. u.s. rep. <mark>mike rogers</mark>' no-tax pledge is in line with his voters' wishes ind. plane crash
