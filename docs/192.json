other end zone. the band is loud, the crowd is enthusiastic, and, perhaps more than anything, the panthers are accustomed to winning there. in the previous 199 games at the petersen events center, the pittsburgh had won 178 and lost 21. although their home invincibility had wavered since last season, a game against the irish in the petersen events center looked to be just what the panthers needed. pittsburgh was returning home from a double-digit loss at marquette saturday. the panthers were looking forward to some home cooking against an irish team that was blown out by 17 points at providence. two years ago, notre dame came into petersen events center and recorded a 56-51 victory. monday night, for the first 14 minutes of the game, it looked as if the irish wouldn't reach double figures by halftime. then, over the final 27:08, the irish out-scored pittsburgh, 48-23, and out-rebounded the panthers, 40-25, for the game. \"we are a mature team,\" said jerian grant, who missed all seven field-goal attempts in the first half, but converted 4-of-8 in the second half - including three three-pointers - in notre dame's 51-42 victory. \"we moved on from the providence game. in the big east, once you take a loss, you have to bounce back. i think we did that pretty well tonight .\" notre dame missed its first 12 shots and 17 of its first 18 to fall behind 19-3 with 7:08 left in the first half after tray woodall converted two free throws as a result of a mike brey technical. brey was willing to try anything, including irrationality, during the second-to-last tv timeout of the first half. \"i didn't talk to (the team) much because i was a raving lunatic through most of the timeout after the technical,\" brey said. but the impact of brey's emotion was not lost on the players. \"we just knew coach had our back,\" grant said. \"we always knew that he knew we had a chance. down 19-3, we still could play defense and get back in the game .\" the panthers would score just three more points the rest of the half, and then a mere 20 in the second half, which was just one more point than notre dame scored during it's star-crossed first half. \"the one thing i kept telling them was,\" look, we are defending pretty well. just hang in there. we're only giving them one shot. we're going to get a spurt here,' \"brey said. the irish needed a jump-start offensively, and pat connaughton provided it. back-to-back threes within 31 seconds of one another suddenly made it a 19-9 game .\" once pat knocked in those two threes, we knew we were going to be able to get back in this game, \"said <mark>jack cooley</mark>, who finished with 13 points and nine rebounds .\" it was late in the half and they only had 19. we were 1-for-18 and that's just dismal shooting. we weren't going to keep shooting that poorly. we knew we had a run in us. \"the atmosphere in the petersen events center began to shift. with each panther miss - they were just 8-of-23 (.348) from the field in the first half themselves - the angst in the home crowd's moans became evident .\" i was just trying to keep our guys fired up because that felt like we tied it quite frankly, \"said brey of his emotion following connaughton's rapid-fire three-pointers to pull the irish to within 10 .\" the climate changed in the building. the vibe changed. our body language changed, and we were able to get a few things offensively that kind of set a tone for us in the second half to have some offensive confidence. \"the irish would take the lead at the 14:41 mark of the second half when a three-point attempt by grant from the left of the circle hit the front of the rim and then slid through the rim for a 29-28 notre dame lead. pittsburgh would regain the lead moments later. but when eric atkins scored on a drive to the bucket with 10:53 left, the irish had the lead for good .\" you just keep playing, \"said atkins of notre dame's 1-of-18 shooting start .\" we were getting some good looks. we missed some easy lay-ups. we just kept saying that we've got to keep guarding them. we just really started to buckle down. i think our defense gave us confidence. \"the more the irish struggled offensively in the first half, the better their defense on the panthers .? pittsburgh's shooting in the second half didn't improve. in fact, they duplicated their 8-of-23 shooting in the second half while the irish shot a sizzling 12-of-20 (.600), including 4-of-6 from three-point range. three were by grant .\" once i hit that three, my confidence was back and the team was really hyped because we finally got a lead, \"grant said .? atkins' driving lay-up put the irish up, 33-32. <mark>tom knight</mark> hit a 17-foot jumper from the corner. after <mark>james robinson</mark> connected on a jump shot, the irish would score the next eight points on a three-pointer by grant, a <mark>cooley</mark> basket with an assist from grant, and another three-pointer by grant at the 4:46 mark that suddenly gave the irish a nine-point bulge .\" we got some stuff in transition, \"brey said .\" once we got a couple in transition, you got a deep breath. and then jerian was really able to get off ball screens and do stuff. \"jerian and eric, after the first 10 minutes, were fabulous. in the second half, they controlled the tempo. then in the last seven minutes we were burning and getting great stuff at the end of the clock .\" the fact that the panthers missed all eight of their three-point attempts was no coincidence. beyond woodall and lamar patterson, the panthers don't have consistent outside firepower, and woodall missed all four of his attempts and patterson didn't attempt one. \"we did a good job scouting them, knowing who we could help off of,\" atkins said. \"i always had the guy that wasn't the best three-point shooter, so i could dig around a little bit. i stayed in the lane when woodall would get in there. we never left woodall or patterson, but everybody else (we could), and we could really pack the lane in and make it tough for their bigs to get an easy look .\" it was really hard for them to score after they got to 19, and that really gave us confidence to get on a run. \"<mark>cooley</mark> said the irish wiped the slate clean after the loss to providence .\" once you lose the first one, there's nothing you can do but turn to the second one, \"<mark>cooley</mark> philosophized .\" to handle it the way we did and with that much adversity is huge. \"one shot at a time, one possession at a time, one victory snatched from the jaws of defeat.", "articleID": "2013022022_00036337_W", "names": {"Jack Cooley": ["Q21546487", "Q6111803"], "James Robinson": ["Q1635374", "Q16875103", "Q19325049", "Q21176869", "Q25415496", "Q28528705",

trading after it released its results, following a nearly 2% slip in the regular session. the company should be \"slightly profitable\" in the current quarter amid higher gross profit margins and lower r & d expenses, tesla ceo elon musk said in a letter to shareholders. this excludes noncash option and warrant expenses. analysts didn't expect the company to hit the black until q3. tesla ceo elon musk, here in a media session last year, has been out front in defending the firm's model s. kyodo view enlarged image \"tesla-powered cars have now been driven more than 40 million miles,\" musk said in the earnings announcement. he also said production is \"now reliably at an annualized rate of 20,000 units per year .\" in a conference call with analysts, he says the rate could top that later this year, and the wait time for car buyers is usually about five months. tesla said it lost 65 cents per share minus items, vs. a 69-cent loss in q4 2011. revenue soared to $306.3 million from $39.4 million. analysts polled by thomson reuters expected a 53-cent loss on revenue of $298.9 million. tesla says it produced more than 2,750 vehicles in q4 and more than 3,100 in 2012. it topped its projected run rate of more than 400 vehicles a week for three weeks in december and says it's maintained that pace into q1. that beat tesla's 2012 target of 2,500-3,000 vehicles, which jefferies & co. analyst elaine kwei said pre-earnings she expected. one of \"the most important things will be the pace of production .\" she said. tesla has targeted a better-than - 25% gross margin once production efficiencies are in place. pacific crest securities estimates 20% for q1, slightly shy of consensus. tesla guided below pacific crest's number but might have stayed close enough. \"for me, the most important reporting metric is going to be gross margin guidance for the first quarter,\" pacific crest analyst ben schuman told ibd ahead of the report. schuman says anything under 15% would \"raise

sandy baruah: business leaders\" ready to accept' efm what it would mean for detroit: questions, answers on emergency financial managers detroit's fiscal crisis is \"solvable, in my view,\" gov. rick snyder insisted today. but how, when the city's population and tax base keep shrinking, can detroit possibly stabilize and improve services to its citizens anytime soon? snyder's answer was sketchy when i asked him about how to reverse the city's plunging revenues. he talked about growing the city, about quicken loans adding jobs, about chrysler and blue cross blue shield of michigan moving workers to downtown from the suburbs. ok, there are some bright spots, but snyder, the nerdy numbers guy, knows full well that city tax revenues lag a few years behind any recovery in jobs or property values that might be germinating. here's what the state's detroit financial review team reported about the money flowing into city coffers in the last five fiscal years: incoming revenue to the city's general fund from taxes, fees, fines and other sources was $1.49 billion in fiscal 2006-07. five years later it was $1.1 billion. that's a decline of 26%, or nearly $400 million, in the funding available for police, fire, streetlights, parks and other services. going forward, any rescue plan for detroit must include more cost-cutting, a serious restructuring of long-term debt and retiree obligations, and - in snyder's own words - \"growing the city .\" the financial review team has produced reams of data on the expense issues, but virtually nothing in terms of a credible scenario for growing detroit's revenue base. snyder told me that he and state treasurer andy dillon have studied the fiscal rescues of new york in the 1970s and washington, d.c., in the late 1990s, as well as the bailouts and bankruptcies of general motors and chrysler in recent years. no single one of those cases is a perfect model for detroit's challenge, he said, but there are instructive lessons in all of them. perhaps the most impressive tough love during the auto bailouts was the federal government's rejection of a series of so-called \"viability plans\" from gm and chrysler, until the companies came up with realistic projections for what brands and products they could save and grow. today gm and chrysler are stable and profitable as a result. snyder repeated thursday that he has not yet decided to install an emergency manager, and said he would listen to mayor bing and the detroit city council's ideas during the next week or so. but after hearing the governor tick off a list of the delays, lawsuits and stumbles during the past year of dealing with the city, it's hard to imagine his settling now for a tweaking of the consent agreement. whoever's on the governor's short list to become detroit's fiscal taskmaster, they'd better be as forceful as the feds were with the auto companies; extremely sensitive to detroit's political and cultural fault lines; and thick-skinned as

floyd landis - a former <mark>armstrong</mark> teammate who was stripped of the 2006 tour de france crown for doping to which he admitted - alleging <mark>armstrong</mark> defrauded us taxpayers by claiming he was winning tour de france titles without taking performance-enhancing substances. \"<mark>lance armstrong</mark> and his cycling team took more than $30m from the us postal service based on their contractual promise to play fair and abide by the rules - including the rules against doping,\" ronald machen, us attorney for the district of columbia, said on friday. robert luskin, <mark>armstrong</mark> attorney, said in a statement that talks with federal lawyers collapsed over how to measure damages, with <mark>armstrong</mark>'s side saying the postal service reaped huge benefits from its cycling sponsor deal. \"those talks failed because we disagree about whether the postal service was damaged,\" luskin said. \"the postal's service's own studies show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship - benefits totalling more than $100 million .\" sponsorship evaluations to support the claim, <mark>armstrong</mark>'s camp released sponsorship evaluations from 2001, 2002 and 2004 that attempted to place a monetary value on the exposure benefits to us postal at that time. the studies claimed that for $32.276 m spent by us postal from 2001-2004, there was $103.636 m in publicity benefits with never less than a 300 percent return in investment in any year of the sponsorship. there was no study to show any potential fallout in negative publicity from being attached to <mark>armstrong</mark>'s now-tainted era in the wake of his confession to being a dope cheat in a television interview with oprah winfrey last month. links to the greatest doping scandal in cycling history could have provided damaging publicity and a more-recent negative payback for us postal, already forced to stop saturday delivery later this year because of financial woes. <mark>armstrong</mark> was deprived of his tour de france titles last year after the us anti-doping agency (usada) uncovered overwhelming evidence, included testimony from 26 witnesses, that he was at the heart of a major doping conspiracy. equivalent costs fcb sports marketing's evaluation of us postal's 2001 benefits said that $6.138 m in sponsorship investment brought us postal $18.539 m in exposure and global publicity could boost the value as high as $40m. the studies used equivalent costs of advertising time on television coverage of the tour or print advertising in newspapers or on websites where mentions of us postal or photos with its logo were shown. also measured was the value of <mark>armstrong</mark>'s image with the us postal logo in such areas as magazine covers, television talk shows, commercials for other sponsors such as nike and other appearances and marketing opportunities. studies also recognised \"intangible benefits\" from <mark>armstrong</mark>'s popularity at the time, but noted \"there are no standards and the value lies with the individual corporation and their objectives\" .", "articleID": "2013022223_00065208_W", "names": {"Lance

quarter-finals. goals from kevin mirallas, leighton baines and leon osman took david moyes' side into the last eight, where they will face wigan athletic, with oldham's cup talisman <mark>matt smith</mark> replying for the visitors. \"we've been close a couple of times and that whets your appetite. we want to go further, but we've got a tough tie next,\" baines told itv. \"we're at home so we'll be favourites, but we've had tough games against them the last couple of seasons and they're coming off the back of a good win (over reading) at the weekend, so they'll be confident .\" beaten semi-finalists in last season's competition, everton were without the injured marouane fellaini but made a purposeful start and took the lead in the 15th minute. after a patient build-up, darron gibson shaped a beautiful cross into the box from deep on the right and mirallas stole in to finish with an adroit half-volley from eight yards. oldham almost drew level immediately through former everton youngster jose baxter, who seized on a loose ball on the edge of the box but saw his curling shot bounce back off the right-hand upright. the visitors then had a penalty appeal turned down when phil jagielka's clearance struck gibson on the arm. their resurgence proved short-lived, however, as baines helped everton stamp their authority on the tie. having seen a vicious strike saved by

they would investigate, test samples of suspicious product last updated: feb 27, 2013 10:24 am nt police in newfoundland and labrador agree that synthetic marijuana is illegal, and if there was suspicion of it being sold over the counter in local stores, they would launch an investigation. cbc news bought herbal incense from two local stores - <mark>mary</mark> janes smoke shop in downtown st. john's and the chad smoke shop 420 in mount pearl. the product was sold under brand names like fusion warped, fusion fission, zap \"r, and kick ass white rabbit. the zap' r herbal incense blend has this label on the back of the package. (cbc) the foil packaging clearly states the product is not meant for human consumption. the vast majority of u.s. states have tried to ban similar products sold as marijuana substitutes. but the herbal incense - which may be sprayed with a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol, or thc, the active chemical in marijuana - seems to exist in a regulatory grey area in canada. a cbc news investigation has sparked police forces across the country to have a look at the product. unfamiliar with synthetic weed royal newfoundland constabulary const. garry crocker said he wasn't very familiar with synthetic weed .\" i haven't had any experience with it, and our drug section, as far as i know, haven't seized any, \"he said. crocker, the rnc's drug awareness co-ordinator, said it is covered under the controlled drugs and substances act (cdsa). const. garry crocker is the drug awareness co-ordinator with the royal newfoundland constabulary. (cbc)\" it is illegal to buy it, sell it, and produce it, \"he said. he said stores selling it would be investigated, and have their product sent to a laboratory for testing .\" it is man-made, and the chemicals in it are unknown until they are tested with the lab, \"he said. but not all synthetic cannabinoids are declared as being banned substances, putting them in a legal grey area. health canada, however, considers anything a controlled substance if it gives the same effect as marijuana. rcmp sgt. steve conohan said it can be a difficult issue to address .\" there are some that are just what they say - there are some that are just potpourri, \"said conohan, the rcmp's co-ordinator of drugs and organized crime awareness .\" because of the varying number of names and whatnot that they put on them, sometimes it's difficult to determine whether or not they have synthetic cannabinoids in them. \"sgt. steve conohan is the rcmp's co-ordinator of drugs and organized crime awareness. (cbc) conohan noted that there are some 140 different varieties of synthetic cannabinoids. while such chemicals have been prevalent in north america for several years, conohan said they haven't had much of an impact in newfoundland and labrador. but conohan said if the rcmp did receive any information on these products being available,\" it would definitely warrant some checking into if it was happening in rcmp jurisdiction. \"the federal force covers most of the province, except for the northeast avalon, corner brook and western labrador regions .\" if we received information, then we would have to do a thorough investigation to determine if in fact it were synthetic cannabinoids that were being sold, \"conohan said. adverse health effects both officers agreed such drugs can be dangerous. conohan said they can produce adverse health effects such as elevated heart rates, paranoia, vomiting, hallucinations, and even renal failure .\" it's man-made, and you don't know what you're taking, what chemicals are in it, what's being used, and the effects that it's going to have on you .' - rnc const. garry crocker crocker said it's also worrisome because people aren't aware of what they're smoking. \"it's man-made, and you don't know what you're taking, what chemicals are in it, what's being used, and the effects that it's going to have on you,\" he said. the manager at <mark>mary</mark> janes smoke shop told cbc news the store only sells the herbal incense for \"a relaxing aroma in your home,\" and not for any kind of human consumption. the owner of the chad smoke shop 420 declined to comment. cbc news is taking steps to securely destroy the packages it purchased during this investigation. \"putting your life at risk' paul daeninck is an oncologist and palliative care physician at st. boniface hospital for cancercare manitoba. one of his interests is the use of cannabinoids in the management of symptoms for cancer patients. he is warning the public to stay away from synthetic weed products. daeninck said synthetic cannabinoids were primarily developed for scientific research purposes, and carry a much stronger concentration than the levels of thc found in marijuana cigarettes. winnipeg oncologist paul daeninck is warning people to stay away from synthetic cannabinoids. (cbc) he says it can be 50 to hundreds of times more potent .\" they have not gone through any sort of toxicology, they haven't gone through any sort of testing to look at human consumption, \"daeninck said .\" from a health point of view, it's extremely dangerous, incredibly dangerous to be playing with any of this stuff. \"daeninck said people who use synthetic weed may experience psychosis, and there have even been documented cases of people committing suicide .\" these people literally are putting their life at risk by taking this stuff, \"he said. research in the united states suggests that the 12 - to 17-year-old demographic are the primary users of these products. as a parent, daeninck said he's concerned about synthetic weed being marketed to kids. a vehicle slid into a school bus in the cowan heights area of st. john's on wednesday morning. seniors looking for affordable housing in springdale now have more options, with the opening of new two-bedroom apartments. after 50 years, horse racing in newfoundland and labrador appears to be coming to an end. if you're planning on travelling to or through toronto from newfoundland and labrador today, you might want to check your flight schedule. the greater toronto area is being hit with a mix of snow and rain, creating a sloppy mess throughout the region for the morning commute. with only three days to go until the rrsp deadline for the 2012 tax year, many people are scrambling to scrape together a last-minute contribution, but recent statistics suggest many more are not bothering. canadians save only four per cent of their disposable income and owe $1.65 for every $1 in after-tax household income. we break down the numbers. will annie opsquotch find her true love? sports hardly swept away with brad gushue's success don power writes on the expected lift that local curling never got on the park's 40th anniversary, land & sea looks back at the park's early years burton winters: one year later improvements have been made to search and rescue, but concerns remain your photos download the 2013 your photos calendar your favourite your photos images are featured in this year's calendar our great geography quiz check out our recent group chat and quiz on geography in a guest column, don power says repulsive acts have no place in the game video misses enid and eulalia pitch in for a park <mark>mary walsh</mark> and cathy jones help with bannerman park fundraiser tweeting an astronaut lee pitts writes on the experience of catching chris hadfield's attention bologna behind our love affair with a processed meat heather barrett presents a documentary on a deep-rooted love for bologna interactive test your memory with our annual news quiz we have 20 questions on some of the stories of 2012 santa reunited with mount cashel survivors decades later, orphans reunite with american who brought them hope rnc surveillance footage and interviews about one of n.l.'s biggest drug busts our coverage of the new neighbourhoods expanding across the northeast avalon why should i give a dam? click here for full coverage of muskrat falls - stories, opinions, and video enjoy cecil haire's driving tutorials with expert rudy singleton", "articleID": "2013022714_00054404_W", "names": {"Mary Walsh": ["Q3296255", "Q58120228", "Q6780910", "Q6780911", "Q6780914"]}}]
