(in october, he would become the first foreign minister to visit the tripoli compound of the toppled dictator .) on sept. 26, the house once again approved the extension of the mission, this time over the opposition of the ndp. but by then, tripoli had fallen and col. gadhafi's end was in sight. canada was one of the first countries to re-open its embassy in tripoli. by the end of the campaign, canadian jets had flown 446 missions over iraq, 10 per cent of the nato total, and used up 14.5-million pounds of fuel. the conservative government and nato leaders believe they have drawn valuable lessons from libya. the first is that regimes change only when the people are willing to change them. by limiting its mandate to air strikes, a sea blockade, intelligence and selective use of special forces, the alliance helped make possible a revolution that the libyan people fought themselves. disclaimer? copyright 2011 the globe and mail inc. all rights reserved. m5v 2s9 phillip crawley, publisher", "articleID": "2011102201_00064695_W", "names": {"John Baird": ["Q16154590", "Q19043052", "Q27831227", "Q365736", "Q43911239", "Q6220326", "Q6220331", "Q6220342"], "Stephen Harper": ["Q206", "Q7609425"]}}, {"date": "2011-10-24", "url": "http://sent-trib.com/ap-news/local-bodies-say-ohio-state-cuts-leading-to-levies", "content": "local bodies say ohio state cuts leading to levies columbus, ohio (ap) -

when local civil rights activist rudy langford was charged in early october with entering the home of a man killed during a police raid at his home in june, police announced the news the next day. rudy langford, 78 - the president of the coalition for justice for civil rights and a frequent critic of hampton police over the years - was charged on oct. 8 with entering <mark>william cooper</mark>'s home without permission on june 30. he faces a misdemeanor count of unlawful entry. but two other men were arrested in early august, without fanfare, in a separate case involving <mark>cooper</mark>'s home. they're each charged with breaking and entering and grand larceny, both felonies. daily press introduces daily savvy deals. sign up now to receive offers that are 50% off or more! the arrests of joseph e. woodward, 30, and david k. ezzell, 35, both of hampton, came after the woman serving as the executor of <mark>cooper</mark>'s estate said she arrived at the home on aug. 9 and caught them stealing <mark>cooper</mark>'s riding lawn mower, and trying to take a tv and a suitcase full of items from his house. but unlike with langford - whose arrest led to a rare police press release announcing a misdemeanor arrest - police didn't tout the news when woodward and ezzell were arrested on the felony counts. part of the reason for the difference, police say, is that langford is a \"public figure .\" \"rudy langford is a public figure who publicly interjected himself into the circumstances that surrounded clifton street,\" said police spokeswoman cpl. allison quinones. \"that is why a release was done on his arrest .\" clifton street was where <mark>cooper</mark> lived. <mark>cooper</mark>, 69, was shot dead just after 10 a.m. on june 18 when police - investigating <mark>cooper</mark> for alleged sales of prescription painkillers - burst into his home under a search warrant. <mark>cooper</mark> opened fire on the incoming officers, with officers shooting back. after the shooting, langford has championed <mark>cooper</mark>'s cause, holding several rallies outside <mark>cooper</mark>'s home and marching a group into police headquarters attempting to speak with police chief <mark>charles jordan</mark>, who has backed the officers. langford has called the police action \"a rush to kill\" and called for federal and state reviews of the case. quinones said a press release wasn't issued after the arrest of woodward and ezzell in august for two reasons. first, because police rarely issue press releases for breaking and entering cases. and second, she contended that publicizing their arrests could have compromised the still-pending investigation into the june burglary case. but <mark>ron smith</mark>, a hampton attorney representing langford, asserts that langford's arrest - as well as his questioning by police for several hours, and the press release issued afterward - was retribution for langford's outspoken criticism over the years. \"there's only one explanation,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. \"you do a press release with implications for a misdemeanor, and you don't do a press release for people arrested for a felony? you don't have to be rocket scientist to see that they're trying to shut up their biggest critic. that's not the right way to do things .\" attorney kevin shea, who is representing the executor of <mark>cooper</mark>'s estate and is planning a wrongful death suit against the city, also weighed in. \"it's remarkable,\" he said. \"i can't put myself in their minds, but i would think they're trying to discredit langford because he's an activist .\" crystal keithley, of hampton, the executor of <mark>cooper</mark>'s estate, said she agreed with shea. \"that's just a given that people would think that,\" she said, adding that it's probably true. hampton mayor molly ward was asked whether she agreed with the attorneys that the different treatment between the two cases points to an effort by police to retaliate on langford. \"it is not appropriate for me to comment on an ongoing criminal investigation,\" she said in a text message from wednesday's hampton city council meeting. city manager mary bunting did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment wednesday. the evidence police used to charge langford hasn't yet been revealed. he has said publicly several times in recent months that he went into the <mark>cooper</mark>'s home to better understand the site of the police-involved shooting. since his arrest, however, langford has said he's innocent of the charges and did not actually go into <mark>cooper</mark>'s home. he has not publicly explained his prior statements. aside from the difference between the two cases, <mark>smith</mark> also asserts that the press release police put out in the langford case was intentionally misleading. \"hampton police arrested a suspect in connection with a burglary that occurred in the 100 block of clifton street,\" the oct. 9 release started out. the statement went on to say that an unknown suspect stole an undisclosed amount of currency from <mark>cooper</mark>'s home, that langford was charged with one count of unlawful entry, and that the burglary investigation is ongoing. <mark>smith</mark> said the wording of the press release \"makes it seem like (langford) had something to do with the stolen currency .\" \"if you don't know the true facts, it leads you to believe that he either did the breaking and entering or was involved,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. \"that's ludicrous .\" in response, quinones, who wrote the release, said the statement's language says clearly that langford was charged with unlawful entry - and not burglary - and called the lawyer's assertions ludicrous. \"the release is self-explanatory,\" quinones said. \"nowhere do i indicate that he stole the money. nowhere in there do i link him to the stolen currency .\" she also stood by her statement that langford was arrested \"in connection\" with the burglary - because, she said, it was while investigating the burglary that police learned that langford had been inside the home. \"that's in connection with the burglary,\" she said. keithley, the executor of <mark>cooper</mark>'s estate - and the aunt of the 15-year-old boy to whom <mark>cooper</mark> left nearly his entire estate in his will - called police on june 30 after noticing that someone had been inside <mark>cooper</mark>'s house. a garbage can had been turned over, its contents sifted through, she said. two bags of coins were missing from a bedroom dresser, and a souvenir budweiser box was gone. at the time, she told police she \"wanted to press charges\" against the intruder. the only mention she made to police of langford was that shea told her he got a call from <mark>cooper</mark>'s son, who relayed that langford had called to say a window to the house was open. keithley said she has never met langford. she said she appreciates him working on the case, and said she doesn't believe he went into the home to try to steal anything. instead, she said, she thinks he went into the home to \"look over what happened\" during the shooting. but keithley said that, if asked by police, she would testify for them that she never gave langford permission to go into the home. hampton university click here for news about hampton university. hrtownsquare.com share your photos, thoughts and more with others from in and around hampton. viewing this on your phone? go to mobile.dailypress.com for a compact version of our site. teel time: notre dame considering full conference membership, says former irish ad, acc commissioner corrigan", "articleID": "2011102711_00105203_W", "names": {"Charles Jordan": ["Q16730426", "Q3666422", "Q5079592", "Q5079596"], "Ron Smith": ["Q15429434", "Q16151519", "Q16214918", "Q20640642", "Q20732311", "Q21598352", "Q28455021", "Q30069157", "Q3441453", "Q7364400", "Q7364401", "Q7364402", "Q7364403", "Q7364404", "Q7364405", "Q7364406", "Q7364407", "Q7364409"], "William Cooper": ["Q16864835", "Q19325787", "Q21464510", "Q22907485", "Q43914985"]}}, {"date": "2011-10-27", "url": "http://entertainment.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=678465&affid=100055", "content": "lindsay lohan's father arrested again in tampa oct. 27, 2011, 8:02 am est tampa, fla.
