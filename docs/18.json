behind aaron rodgers by tom fanning, packers.com posted 08/14/2008 brian brohm will once again be the second quarterback to enter the game again this week when the packers travel to san francisco, but fellow rookie <mark>matt flynn</mark>'s strong play of late has put him in position to compete for the backup quarterback job behind aaron rodgers. even though brohm was a second-round pick and <mark>flynn</mark> was selected in the seventh round of the 2008 nfl draft, head coach <mark>mike mccarthy</mark> said <mark>flynn</mark> is in the mix for the no. 2 job. \"i think <mark>matt</mark>'s definitely closing the gap, there's no doubt about it,\" <mark>mccarthy</mark> said. \"i think he's really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days .\" i think <mark>matt</mark> is getting more comfortable. brian was more comfortable quicker in the earlier part as far as the otas, understanding what we're doing. i think they're both good young prospects. \"neither player put up numbers that jumped off the stat sheet on monday night, but <mark>mccarthy</mark> said both brohm and <mark>flynn</mark> showed some signs of progress .\" just looking at their grades, they did a number of positive things in the game, \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said .\" they did not have winning performances is the way we look at it, and it's just a number of things we need to clean up. \"i've said it time and time again; (those) guys need to play. we knew this was going to take probably the full preseason to get those two guys ready, and we feel like we're on course to get that done .\" <mark>flynn</mark> entered monday night's game with a 5:27 to go in the third quarter and played five series, and finished the night 12-of-21 for 97 yards and a touchdown. with the packers trailing 20-10 with a little over six minutes remaining in the game, <mark>flynn</mark> led the offense on a 12-play, 62-yard drive that was capped off with an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back kregg lumpkin. <mark>flynn</mark>'s debut included some rough moments, beginning with a sack on his very first play, which he said could have been avoided. \"the things that always stick out in my mind are mistakes,\" <mark>flynn</mark> said. \"i could have made a couple of adjustments on protections. that would have helped out and not got me sacked on the first play. just the little things, reads, being quicker with decisions and things like that .\" despite entering camp as the third quarterback as a late-round pick, <mark>flynn</mark> said his focus has remained on getting better each practice and learning the offense. \"i really don't assume anything,\" <mark>flynn</mark> said. \"i came in here and i didn't really know what the situation was going to be or what it's going to be like at the end of camp. it's one of those things that i am going to go out and play as hard as i can and just let the coaches do their job .\" i look at it like i have an opportunity to come in here and learn how to play the game, learn from some great coaches, learn from aaron, and do the best i can and take advantage of the opportunity. \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said earlier during camp that brohm has picked up the mental aspect of the game better than any other young quarterback that he has worked with, but against the bengals, brohm wasn't able to put any points on the board monday night in his five series directing the offense. brohm's evening got off to an inauspicious start as well, as he threw an interception on his very first play on as pass intended for wide receiver <mark>james jones</mark>. he finished the night 8-of-17 for 70 yards, but did make a nice throw at the end of the first half when he hooked up with fellow rookie jordy nelson for a 22-yard gain .\" overall i felt like i did a pretty good job of just the mechanics of the offense, getting in and out of the huddle, \"brohm said after the game on monday night .\" most of the time i felt like i went to the right place with the ball. obviously there were a few times where i made mistakes and went to the wrong place, forced one in there on the first play. \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said the quarterback rotation will remain the same at san francisco on saturday night, and that as of now the number of repetitions that brohm and <mark>flynn</mark> will each receive will stay the same as well .\" we've kept them the same, as far as going through the installation phase, \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said .\" brian took the reps of the no. 2 and <mark>matt</mark> took the reps of the no. 3. based on the period, 3-2-1 is the ratio, sometimes it was 4-2-1 as far as the starter. now, once we got into this in-season schedule, they split the opponent reps, and brian is still getting a little more work than <mark>matt</mark>. \"on wednesday, general manager ted thompson said even though it is unusual to have two rookies backing up the starter at quarterback, the team is pleased with the tandem's development up to this point .\" i don't know if you drew it up like this is the way you would do it, but this is the way it is, \"thompson said .\" we like our two young guys, and we think they are on a steady path here. quite frankly, our coaching staff likes working with them, so we feel pretty good. \"despite the inexperience at the position, thompson added that the team won't close the door on the possibility of bringing in a veteran at the position, but that it isn't more of a priority than any other spot on the roster. this makes me sad i hope broum gets a better feel for the game thats who i want to see backing up rogers", "articleID": "2009031702_00048794_W", "names": {"Mike Mccarthy": ["Q1933317", "Q21062541", "Q22279122", "Q506866", "Q6847875", "Q6847876",

september 4, 2008 6:24 pm comments (1) for a vice presidential candidate who didn't own a passport until last year, sarah palin's brief passages on national security thursday night were perfectly tailored to her lack of expertise or experience in foreign affairs. but it hit the spot--the oil spot, to be precise--in a rollicking acceptance speech spent mostly ridiculing the democratic ticket and extolling the expertise hockey moms bring to high office. the alaska governor's office floats in a sea of oil politics. during her 20 months in office, palin threw herself into ramping up exports of north slope supplies to the lower 48. in fact, she accelerated the construction of infrastructure to deliver fuel. it's hard to imagine an alaska governor not knowing at least something about what's going on in the rest of world's energy markets. but it's a sure bet that the average alaskan is as familiar with the intricacies of crude futures as ordinary iowans are with the price of ethanol or, for that matter, third worlders with the price of kerosene. but otherwise, palin has shown little interest in the world outside the united states. her first, and apparently only, foreign travel came last year, to visit members of the alaska national guard stationed in kuwait, and wounded troops in germany, according to her deputy communications director, sharon leighow. that was roughly equal to the travels of george w. bush when he entered the white house in 2001. the erstwhile texas governor had visited china when his father was ambassador to beijing in the 1980s, and israel, and there were the famous \"lost weekends\" in mexico during his drinking years--all of which, critics say, left him woefully unprepared for the rigors of the post-9 / 11 world. historians will have the final call on that. palin sounded authoritative when she mentioned \"russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the caucasus and to divide and intimidate our european allies by using energy as a weapon...\"critics have credited speechwriter matthew scully, late of the bush white house, with writing the words palin merely sang. but as tidy a line as that was, it's likely palin had at least as much a hand in drafting it as scully, considering her involvement with oil infrastructure during her term as governor, no matter how brief. she went on to talk about the scary what-ifs: to confront the threat that iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of the world's energy supplies, or that terrorists might strike again at the abqaiq facility in saudi arabia, or that venezuela might shut off its oil discoveries and its deliveries of that source, americans, we need to produce more of our own oil and gas...big applause. and take it from a gal who knows the north slope of alaska: we've got lots of both. more big applause. if palin didn't write that line, she sure had obvious fun delivering it. the next lines, though, came right out of the republican boilerplate for the past eight years. starting in january, in a mccain-palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines, and build more nuclear plants, and create jobs with clean coal, and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal, and other alternative sources...the problem is, it's a script grounded more in the kind of kitchen-table, hockey-mom talk that makes so much sense to so many people, until it's tested against the complicated real world. washington has shown only fitful interest in alternative energy supplies (the technology for which, most energy economists say, doesn't exist yet to generate meaningful amounts of power). and nuclear is a non-starter, unless she and mccain win the election and the republicans take both houses of congress - not--unless we want to buy them from france; u.s. companies deserted the business years ago. nor is there's going to be any explosion of offshore drilling, which all the republicans, except those who actually would have to look at them from their patios, seem to be for. (likewise, look up <mark>ted kennedy</mark>'s position on windmills in nantucket sound .) al gore-like pronouncements that natural gas, not oil, is only a temporary solution to our energy problem. so, like it or not--and nobody outside saudi arabia does--we'll be mired in global oil politics for decades to come, particularly in the middle east so when palin falls back on right-wing red-meat rather than thoughtful alternatives, as she did thursday night, she sounds like nothing more than an echo of harry and louise on the republican ticket--not a serious contender for the second highest post in the land .\" victory in iraq is finally in sight, and he wants to forfeit, \"she said of barrack obama, in a disturbing slander. (has anyone noticed that the iraqis themselves have forced the bush administration into adopting obama's position?) terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay; he wants to meet them without preconditions. and: al qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on america, and he's worried that someone won't read them their rights. yes, they do believe it. don't you have a euro to be chasing away to any minute now? while you are at it, get me a canadian with some furry boots and a thick accent. i'll aboot her immediately. seriously, yes, this whole convention was about lying the fuck out of everything. that's the way it is and i don't hold much hope. this country is on it's last legs and you see it everyday. we will become third world, because all business will be ran by the eu and their land ties will be with asia. we continue to ignore our greatest resource of our neighbors to the south. you know, it's sick as fuck but if chavez declared war on us tomorrow we'd go there and give him the attention and get this economy going again, but our deep prejudices towards those that live amongst us is more overpowering than the hatred that exists on the other side of the world. they have the oil down south and we ignore them, because they do our lawns and those in office don't have good relations with them, because they rebel against us legally. it's much easier to punch an asshole than sign treaties with those organized. corporate america. latin america is our future. it has always been, but they are peaceful and we hate them for giving us cocaine, so we will never pay attention to them. yeh, that whole drug bullshit that reagan got us in. canadians just jump around with a huge oil supply and act like silly americans and i want to join their party. i agree, but reverend wright is not the issue. just my lack of eating. bocc kob on friday, september 05, 2008 -

despite a plea from quad niagara atv president gerry stull and a 130-signature petition, township council will continue to forge ahead with the sale of an abandoned rail line. during a march 10 council meeting, there was discussion of setting aside the abandoned rail line for an atv trail instead of selling it to abutting land owners. council voted 3-2 in favour of the latter. after hearing of that discussion, stull and members of the atv group went door to door and collected 130 signatures hoping to encourage council to rescind its decision and to have a public meeting about the rail line. \"i am still a believer...that town councils are supposed to work for its people and what they want as a whole .\" he said the old east-west rail line that runs north of forkes rd. starting just east of deek's rd. and ending close to the dunnville town line would encourage atvers to ride legally on a trail, instead of riding on private property. \"these lands are a corridor that can link several of our local communities together via a multiuse trail which would run though virtually the heart of our community,\" stull said. longtime club member dennis zierle said he was saddened to hear of council's decision to sell the land without holding a public meeting. ald. evan main said he remembered stull's first presentation to council to create a policed trail system where people could pay to ride. fees would be applied to providing abutting land owners with $5 million in insurance coverage. however, main noted more than 10 months ago council began the process to dispose of the land through sale to abutting land owners, a process he said would be unfair to overturn. \"i do have a problem with going back on my word,\" main said. \"somehow it doesn't seem fair to me to change policies on a whim .\" operations director greg wuisman said the township has three applications to purchase portions of the land where residents have paid a $1,000 application fee. another two applications are in the works and he's received numerous other inquiries. continued after advertisement below ald. rudy warkentin has taken time to speak to farmers and home owners whose property abuts the line. he said many would be opposed to the trail. although he was elected to represent wainfleet as a whole, his concern is for people who would be directly affected. \"it's almost impossible to police this 24/7,\" he said. \"liability still leaves me with unanswered questions .\" mayor barb henderson said although councillors are elected to make decisions, \"people don't always like them .\" she said councillors have been accused of not listening to taxpayers when making decisions, but in this case they are listening to people who would be most affected by change. \"i for one will not change my mind with a public meeting,\" she said. group a week 27 march 23, 2009 away team score home team score club lasalle 22 st. joseph's bakery federal justice minister and niagara falls mp <mark>rob nicholson</mark> will be the special guest speaker as the stamford kiwanis celebrate 50 years of service to is the recent economic turmoil a terrible crisis for investors, or a terrific opportunity? patrick baichoo and <mark>robert brooke</mark> will be at the centennial the library barrels towards one of the busiest weeks of the year! this year's march break features hands-on and entertainment activities for children from brock u -

zero winning seasons dp: mcdaniels kept referring to <mark>cutler</mark> as \"the player\" and not by name. too bad \"the coach\" didn't figure out this sooner. \"the coach\" could have been more proactive to maintain a good relationship from the get go. unless \"the coach\" never intended to keep \"the player\" in the first place. they better get 2 1st and a second, or 1st and second and donovan we dont need quinn, all the quaterbacks come out next year.and i'm sure we'll have a top 5 pick in 2010 it would be nice if \"the coach\" could form his own unique identity and personality. \"the coach\" doesn't need to be a clone of \"the cheater\" does he? personally, i like \"the player\" more than \"the coach\" don't you? <mark>jay</mark> will be back and the defense will be better. i can't wait til the draft and then the start of the season...go broncos...\"if <mark>cutler</mark> is told he is untouchable, wouldn't champ bailey have the right to expect the same designation\" most definitely. something like we want you to retire a bronco in the ring of fame. yes i would show <mark>jay</mark> the money and replace our overpriced longsnapper. it shows mcd can't use the talent already here. it also shows he cant manage the salary cap either. (or maybe he doesn't talk to the gm or maybe the gm doesn't know what the hell hes doing either) ah thats right xanders is learning on the job too. pat bowlen are you learning on the job too? thats right you're an absentee owner way to go mcdaniels. i knew you had it in you to suck it up and make amends. we will forgive your rookie mistake. now you better be a damn good coach in the playcalling arena or were gonna drag you back to new england behind maddens bus. \"{quoted text} right on milehigh_7. if <mark>jay cutler</mark> is simply\" the player \", then coach mcdingbat shall heretofore be referred to only as\" the mistake. \"can't even call him by his name? run <mark>jay</mark>. run. as far...\"john s 3 minutes ago\" {quoted text} uh no mcdaniels doesnt have more power. he isnt the vp of player personel. shanahan was. \"lax 65 6 minutes ago\" its peria jerry!! not jerry peria. he is listed between 290 and 295 pounds, thats a far cry from 325 or bigger. he is nowhere near the size that is required at the nt position. fili moala is 304 pounds and fit for the 4-3 tackle spot. its raji or ron...\"lax 65 13 minutes ago\" {quoted text} bingo! i got attacked by the bronco cheerleader myself today! i was going off about how i think <mark>cutler</mark> is great and that he has all of the bronco organization by the short ones and i was commenting my dislike and distr...\"", "articleID": "2009032517_00034426_W", "names": {"Jay Cutler": ["Q312811", "Q937778"]}}]
