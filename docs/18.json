September 03, 2018 09:22 PM A key opponent of high-tech, automated weapons known as\" killer robots \"is blaming countries like the U.S. and Russia for blocking consensus at a U.N.-backed conference, where most countries wanted to ensure that humans stay at the controls of lethal machines. Advertisement Coordinator Mary Wareham of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots spoke Monday after experts from dozens of countries agreed before dawn Saturday at the U.N. in Geneva on 10\" possible guiding principles \"about such\" Lethal Automated Weapons Systems. \"Point 2 said:\" Human responsibility for decisions on the use of weapons systems must be retained since accountability cannot be transferred to machines. \"Related Stories Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tells Newspaper He is Cracking Under Stress Wareham said such language wasn't binding, adding that\" it's time to start laying down some rules now. \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the principles and expressed hopes the countries who signed on\" can build upon this achievement, \"according to a statement from his spokesman. Wareham said delegates had just\" kicked the can down the road \"until the next meeting on LAWS in November. The\" usual suspects \"including the United States, Russia, Israel and South Korea--joined unexpectedly by Australia, she said--were behind an effort to keep the text from being more binding .\" The fact is that it's the majority that wants it, but you know, it's the Convention on Conventional Weapons--and this is where it's about consensus and...a small minority of states--or even a single one can hold back the desires of the majority, \"Wareham said. Amandeep Gill, an Indian diplomat who chaired last week's meeting of experts, expressed satisfaction about the outcome, while cautioning that such systems should not be\" anthropomorphized, \"or attributed with human qualities.

And when I'd protest at the seemingly never ending list of things to do - clean the house, mop and wax the floors, wash and iron the clothes - she would tell me, \"Idle hands are the Devil's workshop .\" In my young mind, I couldn't understand how my hands had anything to do with the Devil's workshop. I didn't even know him. Anyway, my mom could never sell that story to the ladies at Grace Lutheran Church and their friends from other churches in the area. They wouldn't buy it. That's because they never have \"idle hands .\" They keep busy sewing quilts that are used to bless people throughout the United States and even in other countries. On Jan. 26 at 10 a.m., the quilts, made by loving hands and put together from donated materials, will be dedicated during the service. In the past, quilts from Grace have been given to people and families in areas of disaster and trouble. For example, the quilts have blessed in places like Haiti and Peru and send a message of love and support to all who receive them. The blessing of the quilts is also a way of saying thanks to the dedicated women who made them. Grace Lutheran is at 254 Curtiss Parkway in Miami Springs. Organ recital Joanne Schulte is considered one of the finest organists in the world. So, when she tells you that someone is \"perhaps the finest young organist in America today,\" well, you believe her. Schulte is referring to Nathan Laube, who will appear in a recital at 4 p.m. Sunday in Florida International University's Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Performing Arts Center-Concert Hall at 10910 SW 17th St. Laube will perform on the Wertheim concert hall organ, which is according to Schulte, is the only concert hall organ in South Florida. The event is presented by the Miami Chapter of the American Guild of Organists, of which Schulte is sub dean. She also is director of organ studies at FIU. The recital is free and open to the community. A reception will follow the recital. Jewish history A program on the \"Forgotten Jews from Arab Lands\" will be at 2 p.m. Jan. 26 at the Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU, 3012 Washington St. in Miami Beach. According to a press release, little is still known about the nearly one million Jews of North African, Middle Eastern and Iranian decent, also known as Sephardic Jews, who were expelled or forced to flee their homes in the 1940s. <mark>Henry Green</mark>, a University of Miami religion studies professor, is spearheading a project to draw attention to Sephardic Jews, who became refugees after they were uprooted from their communities, lost their citizenship and within a half century, had all but disappeared from their ancestral homes. <mark>Green</mark> calls his audiovisual history project, which he started in 2009, \"Sephardi Voices .\" To date, some 250 testimonies have been collected by research teams in Miami, New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Jerusalem. His goal is to collect 5,000 testimonies over the next five years. However, he must work fast, as his subjects are elderly and their memories are fading, while others are passing on each day, he said in a press release. \"This project offers the last chance to save and document this irretrievable period of Jewish history that stretches back to the prophet Jeremiah, the writings of the Talmud and Maimonides,\" he said. The program is free and open to the public. For more information, call the museum at 786-972-3175 or email: info @ jewishmuseum.com. Free lectures Temple Judea at 550 Granada Blvd. in Coral Gables will present Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman, Ph.D. in two free lectures. Hoffman, who served for more than three decades as professor of liturgy at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York, will lecture at the Barocas Lecture on \"Judaism for the Next Generation\" at 10 a.m. Jan. 26. The lecture will explore Judaism's response to the frantic search for human meaning against the backdrop of science, art, the challenge to tradition and the \"re-religionization\" of America. At 7 p.m. Jan. 27, Hoffman will speak at the Eric B. Meyers Lecture on \"What's So Critical About Ritual?\" In his lecture Hoffman will explore what Jews get from engaging in ritual and how ritual can lead to a theology. He will also address how Jews respond to traditional critique of ritual from the great thinkers of psychology, sociology and economic theory. Both free lectures are open to the entire community.

he'd do whatever cornell thought would help the team. cornell said that willingness to switch positions says it all about driscoll, who is a great competitor and always puts the team first. conn college has posted wins over farmingdale state, amherst, clarkson, plymouth state, and trinity. the 10-8 win over amherst was the first victory over the lord jeffs since 2001. driscoll and freshman defenseman brogan o'connor of st. john's prep are the two local players on the squad. the camels know every team will be looking to end the unbeaten streak. they take on nescac rival bowdoin in a key game on the road this afternoon. driscoll was also just named to the nescac's winter all-academic team. students must be a varsity letterwinner and have a cumulative average of 3.35 or better. driscoll was a two-year hockey captain for the camels. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 the second annual charity flag football game at manning field in lynn last weekend was a huge success. the biggest winner was the make-a-wish foundation, which received $3,392 from the family-friendly event. police and fire departments from peabody, lynn, salem and beverly competed in the exciting games. the money raised came from ticket sales at the gate and at each department participating, donations from local businesses, raffle tickets and from the north shore flag football league. donations from local businesses paid for the t-shirts worn by the teams. roland james, a former new england patriot, handled the coin toss for the peabody vs. lynn fire department game, and stayed around to sign autographs for the kids. the boston militia women's pro football team was also on hand to raffle off team apparel and held a 50/50 raffle that raised over $200 for make-a-wish. pop warner ran a concession stand to raise money for the league. the make a wish foundation sent four volunteers to help out at the gate, and the flag football league donated the flags for the games. \"the weather was great, the games were great and everything ran smoothly,\" said nsffl founder austin bradshaw, who organized the event. \"this event will only get bigger and better every year .\" i have already been contacted by the departments to discus what we can work on for next year. the two new teams, salem and beverly, told me they are in for next year's event. we may move it to peabody or beverly and possibly have it before the football season opens in august, because the weather is so unpredictable this time of year. \"local businesses that helped sponsor the departments included murphy's restaurant and bar, engine house pizza, pickled onion, fibber mcgee's, <mark>paddy kelly</mark>'s, champions pub, lynn fire union and the police athletic club. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 new notre dame football coach <mark>brian kelly</mark>, the former st. john's prep football player, has been busy lately. he was the first speaker at the 14th annual key bank gridiron legends luncheon series at the college hall of fame in irving, texas. the series, which runs from march through june, is open to the general public, and <mark>kelly</mark> spoke to a sold out crowd last month. <mark>kelly</mark> will also receive the 2010 lee tressel ohio college coach of the year award later this month. he is being honored for his work as the highly successful head coach at the university of cincinnati prior to being hired at notre dame. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 after 41 years at the ipswich high helm, ken spellman has stepped down as the tigers' head spring track coach and indoor coach pat rich has taken over. the tigers also have a new girls coach in marty binette. he replaces micki mcvann, who had coached the team for six years .\" ken is the best assistant coach anybody could have, \"said rich .\" just because he's no longer the head coach doesn't mean he's not around;

After three sold-out shows at the fabled First Avenue nightclub (the setting of Prince's hit 1984 movie \"Purple Rain\" ) in September, The Revolution is back, preparing to kick off a tour Friday at Paisley Park in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen on the anniversary of Prince's death. The tour includes stops in Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco before ending in Seattle on July 15. Melvoin is joined by bassist BrownMark, keyboardists Matt Fink and <mark>Lisa Coleman</mark>, and drummer Bobby Z. The reunited Revolution plans to play Prince's synthesizer-heavy 1980s music through his lauded 1987 double album \"Sign o' the Times .\" \"We have the ability now to give people a glimpse of what we experienced with him,\" BrownMark said. \"And I think that's a powerful thing. I know it helped me heal .\" While Prince had a reputation as a perfectionist, members of The Revolution remember the good times goofing in the studio. \"We had fun. We had a lot of fun. Sometimes we would be rehearsing and we'd crack up, we'd just laugh for an hour, cracking jokes,\" BrownMark recalls. \"We'd go play softball,\" keyboardist Fink said. \"\"OK, we're not going to rehearse today, let's go play softball .'\" After years of recording and touring with The Revolution, Prince \"did what any boss would do and just put it (the band) to bed,\" Bobby Z. said. \"That intense run we had, all those years, it was starting to come apart at the seams, with personalities and under that kind of pressure, just like human beings do, and he just kind of made a decision,\" the drummer said. \"And he wanted to move on as basically a solo artist with a backing band, no disrespect. But this was a band he was a very critical member of .\" Whether The Revolution will continue beyond this tour is an open question. \"We'd love to be able to see if there are some legs with this,\" Melvoin said. ___ Follow Jeff Baenen on Twitter at https: //twitter.com/jeffbaenen.

Related Content Saturn's rings haven't always been there (CNN) - Early humans were still swinging from trees two million years ago, scientists have said, after confirming a set of contentious fossils represents a \"missing link\" in humanity's family tree. The fossils of Australopithecus sediba have fueled scientific debate since they were found at the Malapa Fossil Site in South Africa 10 years ago. And now researchers have established that they are closely linked to the Homo genus, representing a bridging species between early humans and their predecessors, proving that early humans were still swinging from trees 2 million years ago. The Malapa site, South Africa's \"Cradle of Humankind,\" was famously discovered by accident by nine-year-old Matthew Berger as he chased after his dog. That stroke of luck eventually led to this week's finding, detailed in the journal \"Paleoanthropology .\" The findings help fill a gap in humankind's history, sliding in between the famous 3-million-year-old skeleton of \"Lucy\" and the \"handy man\" Homo habilis, which was found to be using tools between 1.5 and 2.1 million years ago. They show that early humans of the period \"spent significant time climbing in trees, perhaps for foraging and protection from predators,\" according to the study in the journal \"Paleoanthropology .\" \"This larger picture sheds light on the lifeways of A. sediba and also on a major transition in hominin evolution,\" said lead researcher <mark>Scott Williams</mark> of New York University. \"Still so much to discover' Two partial australopith skeletons--a male and a female - were found in 2008 at a collapsed cave in Malapa, in South Africa's\" Cradle of Humankind. \"\"Australopithecus\" means \"southern ape,\" a genus of hominins which lived between around 4 and 2 million years ago. Their discovery set off years of debate in the scientific community, with some rejecting the idea that they were from a previously undiscovered species with close links to the homo genus and others floating the idea that they were from two different species altogether. But the new research has laid those suggestions to rest, and outlined \"numerous features\" the skeletons share with fossils from the homo genus. Australopithecus sediba's hands and feet, for instance, show it was spending a good amount of time climbing in trees. The hands have grasping capabilities, which are more advanced than those of Homo habilis, suggesting it, too, was an early tool-user. The researchers of the paper to highlight the remarkable story of how the fossils were found, pointing out that other dramatic clues to humanity's history are still waiting to see the light of day. \"The first fossil of Au. Sediba was discovered by Matthew Berger, then a nine-year-old, who happened to stop and examine the rock he tripped over while following his dog Tau away from the Malapa pit,\" they wrote. \"Imagine for a moment that Matthew stumbled over the rock and continued following his dog without noticing the fossil,\" they added. \"If those events had occurred instead, our science would not know about Au. sediba, but those fossils would still be there, still encased in calcified clastic sediments, still waiting to be discovered .\" \"The fortuitous discovery of the Malapa fossils and other similarly fortuitous recent finds should be reminders to us all that there is still so much to discover about our evolutionary past,\" the authors concluded.
