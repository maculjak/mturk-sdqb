greinke was gracious a day after losing the title of richest right-hander in baseball to <mark>felix hernandez</mark>. \"he's worth it,\" said greinke, whose six-year, $147 million deal was eclipsed by <mark>hernandez</mark>'s seven-year, $175 million contract with seattle. greinke, however, declined to publicly offer any negotiating advice to the left-hander two lockers over, clayton kershaw, who could become the richest pitcher in history if a contract extension is worked out this spring. the fact that the dodgers are willing to discuss an extension with kershaw after committing hundreds of millions to greinke, hyun-jin ryu and others helped sway greinke to pick the dodgers over other pursuers like the angels, rangers and brewers. greinke said he wanted a team that had the least chance of needing to rebuild during his tenure, which is why he studied the farm systems of some of the interested clubs. \"it wasn't just for the farm system,\" greinke said. \"some of it was the organization's ability to sustain a good team. the dodgers need a farm system less than if i signed with, say, the rays. every team may be able to sustain for a period of time with the current roster, but if something doesn't go right, do they have enough to go out and keep the team competitive? my preference is to be in the playoffs every year, and only a couple teams have a good chance at that .\" greinke said the dodgers were on his radar throughout his contract year and that he spoke with former teammates jerry hairston jr. and jamey wright during the season for a feel of the organization. greinke said that when the dodgers made their blockbuster trade with the red sox last summer--acquiring adrian gonzalez, <mark>josh beckett</mark>, <mark>carl crawford</mark> and nick punto for <mark>james loney</mark> and a package of prospects, picking up $280 million in salary commitment--he thought it was \"crazy .\" \"it was definitely bold,\" greinke said. \"it was a lot of money. but then you think about the talented guys; you can't get them without paying. but there was so much money involved, it sounded crazy. then i heard how much money they'll make with the tv deal, [roughly $7 billion].\" reliever elbert not expected back until may glendale, ariz.--dodgers left-handed reliever scott elbert, recovering from his second elbow operation in four months, said on wednesday that he won't resume throwing until next month and doesn't expect to return until may. \"they didn't give me a time frame, but it looks like may,\" said elbert, whose second surgery led to on sept. 19, elbert underwent a first procedure to remove scar tissue in the back of the elbow. but after beginning a throwing program, he developed pain in a different area that led to a jan. 23 arthroscopic procedure involving \"a new area of cartilage damage [that] was discovered and debrided\" by dr. neal elattrache, according to elbert. \"it feels a lot better now,\" elbert said of the elbow. \"after the first surgery, i tried throwing for two weeks but had to shut it down. it never calmed down; it just hurt .\" elbert went 1-1 with a 2.20 era over 43 appearances last year before being injured a second time at the end of august. his injury could provide an opening for lefty <mark>paco rodriguez</mark>, who was the first player from last year's draft to reach the major leagues; he posted a 1.35 era in 11 appearances. elbert said he won't allow himself to push too hard, too soon. \"i know i'm already behind, so there's no reason to force the issue now,\" elbert said. \"what's the difference if i miss four weeks or six? i just want to be sure that when i come back, i come back with a brand new arm .\" glendale, ariz.--korean sensation hyun-jin ryu was not sensational during the first conditioning run of spring training, huffing and puffing and cutting corners at the back of the pack that included pitchers and catchers. ryu then joked to the korean media that in america, they run too fast in spring training. having given up cheeseburgers on a diet that has seen him shed eight pounds, ryu might soon need to consider leaving cigarettes behind, too. \"he made it,\" said manager <mark>don mattingly</mark>, only to be told by a reporter that ryu actually didn't finish. \"no shortcuts in baseball. well, we told him,\" if you feel something, don't go too far .' he didn't. \"ryu is schedule to make his first bullpen session on thursday. it will be the first time general manager ned colletti or <mark>mattingly</mark> will see ryu pitch, other than on video. throwing their first official bullpen sessions of the spring on wednesday were <mark>josh beckett</mark>, chris capuano, chad billingsley, stephen fife, matt magill, matt guerrier, <mark>javy guerra</mark>, shawn tolleson, <mark>paco rodriguez</mark>, kelvin de la cruz, chris withrow, gregory infante and mark lowe. <mark>mattingly</mark>'s focus on team, not contract status glendale, ariz.--dodgers manager <mark>don mattingly</mark> said he won't let his contract status become a distraction .\" it can be part of the noise, but i'm not going to be a distraction to this club, \"<mark>mattingly</mark> said before his pitchers and catchers held their first workout of spring training on wednesday .\" i've always considered myself part of the solution, not part of the problem. i'm not going to be an issue. \"<mark>mattingly</mark> is entering the third and final season of his contract. his request at the end of last season that a 2014 option be guaranteed was declined .\" if it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, it doesn't, \"<mark>mattingly</mark> said about a new deal .\" i'm concerned about doing my job. \"in 2011 and '12--<mark>mattingly</mark>'s two seasons in charge--the dodgers finished in third place and second, respectively, in the national league west. both seasons were hampered by ownership turmoil and, as a result, a limited payroll. this year, new owners have given <mark>mattingly</mark> an expensive and talented roster, and they apparently want to see what he can do with it before committing to him for the long term .\" i'm always challenged to get the most out of my club, \"<mark>mattingly</mark> said .\" i want to put them in the right position to succeed, to flourish. that's my job. then you open the gates, let them run and you're at their mercy. if they don't do the job, then it's my fault. \"<mark>mattingly</mark> acknowledged that the dodgers--through what many consider their ostentatious spending--put a target on their backs .\" yeah, you feel like that, \"<mark>mattingly</mark> said .\" why deny it? why run away from it? be realistic, and hopefully, you kind of spell out what to expect and not to be surprised by the expectations and lay it out. it's something we have a pretty good sense for, and we can address it before it becomes an issue. \"hyun-jin ryu meets the media in los angeles 00:02:23

plans to tackle the issue in greenfield and other franklin county towns over the next few months or years. the task force, as mayor <mark>william martin</mark> calls it, which formed late last year, is hoping to find a way to eventually provide the housing needed to put an end to what it calls a \"growing problem .\" the group consists of the mayor and several heads of local social services agencies. it first met last november to start looking at the homeless problem in franklin county, especially in greenfield. <mark>martin</mark> said the reason for the focus on greenfield is that it is where most services to homeless are located, so that's where they congregate. <mark>clare higgins</mark>, executive director of community action and a member of the group, said she thinks it is a really good group of people working together on a common cause. \"i want to thank the mayor for coming to the table and wanting to be a part of this,\" said <mark>higgins</mark>, a former mayor herself, of northampton. \"this is a very important issue .\" pamela schwartz, director of western massachusetts network to end homelessness, which helps create collaboratives to end homelessness throughout the area through a \"housing first\" approach, said the homeless coalition will act as facilitator and provide support to the group. the group includes the mayor, community action, servicenet, franklin county regional housing and redevelopment authority, greenfield housing authority, franklin regional council of governments, and the interfaith council of franklin county. servicenet runs homeless shelters in the county as well as other social service programs with state and federal funding. schwartz said the task force will be looking at socio-economic and housing issues, as well as what the homeless need and where they need it. \"later, the group will develop a timeline and the strategies to get there,\" said schwartz. john counter, executive director of the greenfield housing authority, said the group has agreed to concentrate on three main areas. \"we'll look at whether housing authorities in franklin county can set aside a certain number of units for the homeless, do an assessment of how many more affordable units are needed in franklin county and where, and find out what state resources are being under-utilized,\" said counter. he said the homeless crisis in massachusetts is \"beyond any of us,\" but said that he's glad to see it is being addressed locally. \"one of the things we'll have to talk about is that with new affordable housing will have to come massive amounts of support for people,\" said counter. \"the bulk of homeless people are chronically homeless, and they need so much more assistance to become sustainable, even living in public housing units .\" schwartz said the forming of the group did not happen in response to the governor's recent announcements about the state eliminating its temporary placement of the homeless in hotels and motels within a couple of years, or his pledge for 10,000 new affordable dwellings across the state each year for the next 10 years. she said shelters and hotels, because of the limits to what they can provide people, are not the solution to homelessness. she said the group will not be talking about creating more shelters, but rather getting people out of them permanently. \"the group formed because there is a problem locally, and people want to find ways to fix that problem,\" she said. schwartz said most homeless people will relocate to the place in their area where there are the most services, because they have no way to get around. robin sherman, executive director of franklin county regional housing and redevelopment authority in turners falls, said the group will meet monthly. \"we've met three times,\" she said. \"we've been sharing our general concerns and will be working closely with each other to collect the information we need to move forward .\" sherman said that includes data, which will be collected by the frcog over the next several months. according to frcog executive director linda dunlavy, the council plans to gather data on how many homeless people there are in franklin county, and how many new or renovated units would be needed to accommodate them. \"we haven't even created the scope of work yet, because we are in the very early stages,\" said dunlavy. \"we're hoping eventually to come up with some sort of number, so the group has something to work with as it moves forward. we'll be educating each other on current conditions. that will help us understand where we are headed .\" she said frcog will pay for the assessment and analysis it is about to do with grant money from the department of housing and community development. \"we have a grant that we are supposed to use to focus on housing needs,\" said dunlavy. \"this is perfect timing .\" sherman said the group will also be looking at where the county's current homeless are getting services from, and what kind of services they are receiving. \"then, we'll be looking at short - and long-term solutions,\" she said. once the group has agreed on solutions, it will shift its focus to strategies and implementation, she said. miscellaneous: queen pillow top mattress set. new in plastic, serta made. $150. dan (413) 977-6144

and whether the village should even undertake the ambitious public works endeavor at all. but preliminary figures complied by village staff and consultants show it would cost winnetka about $48.2 million to build a \"comprehensive\" storm water drainage system to relieve chronic flooding problems in parts of the community. staff also said the $48.2 million figure would decrease if the village decided to move ahead on a less comprehensive storm water management system. winnetka, il, usa the $48.2 million price tag, however, does not include the immense cost of financing the project. during a recent \"rate and fee analysis workshop\" village staff and consultants told trustees that the total cost of the undertaking would ring in at slightly more than $74 million when including interest paid on bonds over a 30-year term. they also said the project would cost about $66 million if it was financed over a 20-year term. winnetka homeowner rick mcquet attended the feb. 12 workshop and he said he left the meeting with a lot of unanswered questions. \"i have not heard a reasonable explanation of why this proposed project is going to be so expensive on a per resident basis,\" said mcquet, who has lived in the village for five years. he also said his online research indicates that the proposed winnetka sewer water project would be the most expensive storm water utility in the country on a per resident basis. <mark>steven saunders</mark>, winnetka's director of public works, acknowledged that some residents may get sticker shock when then see the dollar amounts associated with the cost of the project, but he also said those figures are not carved in stone and could be significantly lower because the village has yet to decide on the scope of the project or how it will be paid for if it is eventually built. he also said the village is seeking residents input on all aspects of the proposal. \"as the concept gets further refined, we will want significant public discussion and engagement in terms of gauging public opinion and educating the public on the benefits and the costs of the project and the various ways (it) could be paid for,\" he said. \"questions come in from time to time, and we encourage those. we have a lot of information posted on our website .\" parts of winnetka have been facing a monster-flooding problem for years, and the issue came to forefront in a big way in 2011 following a severe summer rainstorm that caused widespread flooding. last year, the village started looking at building a new $35 million storm water sewer tunnel under a section of willow road and spending more than $8 million in six residential areas where there's been flooding. the workshop also included discussion of the possible creation of a \"storm water utility\" to help pay for the project and possibly tapping into village reserves to help defray the amount that would have to be borrowed. under one scenario illustrated by village staff and consultant municipal & financial services group, residents would pay a storm water utility tax based on the amount of \"impervious surface\" on their property, <mark>saunders</mark> said. \"the more impervious surface on a parcel, the more runoff that is generated,\" he said. \"it's essentially a user fee based on how much storm water a parcel would generate .\" typically \"impervious surfaces\" on residential properties include the driveway, patios, walkways and the area on which the house sits, so the more impervious surfaces on an individual property the higher rate they would pay, said <mark>saunders</mark>. he also said the same formula would be applied to commercial properties. \"basically what we're trying to achieve is a system of equity whereby folks that generate proportionally more storm water pay in proportion to the amount of storm water they generate,\" he said. according to information on the village website, proper storm water management is a general benefit to all property owners in that it helps to protect property from flooding, increases environmental protection and allows for safe travel in and around the village. according to the website, the goal of a storm water fee is to equitably assess the cost of providing storm water service to property owners based on their impact to the storm water system. \"i disagree that the storm water utility is a benefit to all property owners in the village,\" mcquet said. \"there are a large number of resident who have never experienced flooding. the bulk of the flooding problem is concentrated in a relatively small part of the village .\" <mark>saunders</mark> said the village is scheduled to discuss issue again during a march 12 workshop at the winnetka village hall.", "articleID": "2013021822_00035419_W", "names": {"Steven Saunders": ["Q2563521", "Q2647969"]}}]
