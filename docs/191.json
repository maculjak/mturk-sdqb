the next couple of years, clubs just don't want to commit risky money on older players or players with injury histories .\" next year, the yankees will probably feature an of of nick swisher and...uh,

said, and with the 2010 fa market a year away (from now and from the \"economic crisis\" ), if you're someone like adam dunn or dare i say bobby abreu, why not take your chances with a 1-year deal and hope for a better fa market next season? the yankees will need a cf and a corner of and probably a dh (contingent upon jorge posada's status). that alone could spark a better financial outcome for certain players. i know dunn would get a long look for the dh role. the yanks could use a player like him and if he signed with a team now, for about $8 million (a steal), he could get a better deal in 2010 from brian cashman and the steinbrenner boys. for him it makes particular sense. for someone like pat burrell, it would have made sense too, but he took what he could get with the rays. \"more

Slow down on that talk of Marquette King being the unquestioned replacement for departed punter Shane Lechler. For evidence, notice how the Raiders signed an undrafted free agent and recently worked out veterans Mat McBriar and Jason Baker. King has the benefit over the others of having been with the Raiders last season. He worked with the team through training camp before being placed on season-ending injured reserve. It's wise of the Raiders to bring in some competition for the vacancy created by Lechler signing with the Houston Texans, given King has yet to punt in a regular-season game. In other news, former Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson now sounds more open to signing with teams not viewed as legitimate Super Bowl contenders. In other words, that brings the Raiders into the mix. For more on what Woodson had to say, here's an excerpt from an interview on NFL Network: On his future as an NFL player: \"If it were left up to me, I will be in the NFL again this coming season. Right now, it is kind of slow out there, the options have dried up but I am still waiting for an opportunity to play for a team, help a team win. So I plan on playing in the future .\" On being one of the many free agent veterans currently available: \"It is kind of the process, but at the same time it is frustrating. You have guys that can flat out play football. You look at Dwight Freeney and what he is able to do. They had a system last year that is different than he is used to playing, but he can play football. <mark>John Abraham</mark>, he led his team in sacks and you say\" we don't have a spot for you on our roster?' I can't understand that. Myself, I am just a ball player. I need to be on a team. \"On if he wants to play for a contender:\" When this process first started out, that was my thing, I needed to go to a contender. I know I am towards the end of my career. At this point, I want to play football. So if it is a rebuilding stage, at this point if that is the circumstances I have to play under, then that is what I am going to do. \"On if he would return to the Green Bay Packers:\" I don't want to speculate on that because I have not heard anything from Green Bay. We parted our ways a couple months ago. They told me they were moving on. I guess I took that to mean there was no opportunity to go back so I am looking for a future with another organization. \"On how a team would react to an openly gay player in the NFL: 26 Responses to\" Raiders work out veteran punters; Woodson open to signing with any team \"May 9th, 2013 at 8:00 pm Slow down on that talk of Marquette King being the unquestioned replacement for departed punter Shane Lechler. ***************************** Only the fringe element thought that Steve = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Lechler is 36 and not getting any younger.

But he was electric his rookie season. And he is to valuable a WR to be a punt returner. Don't like that. May 9th, 2013 at 8:02 pm Of course we're bringing in punters. Can't just hand the keys to King. Prove you can be consistent.

Moore looked much better in 2011 than in 2012. May 9th, 2013 at 8:04 pm Unfortunetly, Reggie handed the keys to Flynn, however. May 9th, 2013 at 8:06 pm Moore\" looked \"better in 2011 because he was a rookie with no expectations upon him. Every pass thrown his way was house money. Throw some expectations on his plate, and even though he DID INCREASE HIS PRODUCTION it seemed as a down year to some. He could of, and should of played better, no doubt. But he is a better player now than he was in 2011. They will give it to a vet who can hold, and directional punt. May 9th, 2013 at 8:03 pm Just goes to show how stats can be misleading. Moore looked much better in 2011 than in 2012 .-------- - Yes he did. Especially that game vs SD on Thurs night with Palmer. May 9th, 2013 at 7:58 pm Moore did fumble more last year, and he looked awful in punt returns. 7 TD's for a crappy offense is a lot more impressive to me than his 2011 5 TD's with a good offense. = = = = = = = = = = Give me a break. He also average 4 more yards per catch his rookie year. He started 15 games as opposed to 10 his rookie year. So yeah I hope he was able to eclipse a couple meaningless stats. Go WATCH the film & tell me which Moore was better. Another playmaker Krapp destroyed. Great move Shreg! This is his third year. The third season is the breakout one historically for WRs The only knock against him is that he not that big and Reggie seems to love big receivers. But Reggie did refer to him last year as the #1 even though DHB had had a pretty solid year the year before (in his 3rd season!). May 9th, 2013 at 8:10 pm The Pryor Brigade sure are a bunch of whiny little b1tches. May 9th, 2013 at 8:04 pm Unfortunetly, Reggie handed the keys to Flynn, however. Competition...competition...competition...here's my guy who's never played in a Raider uni...he's our #1 .--------------- It's mind boggling. It is so baffling you have to wonder what the heck is really going on. Does Reggie want the number 1 pick next year? Just sayin. . May 9th, 2013 at 8:11 pm You guys don't remember Moore disappearing for months in 2011? I think he went like 6 games without eclipsng 20 yards receiving. May 9th, 2013 at 8:12 pm Just Fire Baby Says: May 9th, 2013 at 8:06 pm I don't think King makes the roster. They will give it to a vet who can hold, and directional punt. May 9th, 2013 at 8:12 pm Anyone who follows football would completely expect Flynn to be named the #1 guy. He was traded for. He's a vet. He actually looks like a passer. Only here do people think that Pryor should be the #1 due to being a raider longer. They said the other qbs can compete. Grow up and act like men. May 9th, 2013 at 8:12 pm He started 15 games as opposed to 10 his rookie year. So yeah I hope he was able to eclipse a couple meaningless stats. *********************** Yards PER game, catches PER game, were higher last year. They are bringing in vets for looks. Why? They can't kick it further than King, they don't have as big of legs. They will cost more as vets. Don't have as much upside. But as vets they will understand the nuances of the position, like holding and directional punting. May 9th, 2013 at 8:16 pm I would welcoe Woodson back. He would be a coach on the field as was Rod. It may be just what this young team needs to know how to approach this game. May 9th, 2013 at 8:17 pm Just Fire Baby Says: May 9th, 2013 at 8:14 pm What's so funny about that KK?

But as vets they will understand the nuances of the position, like holding and directional punting. Get it?-------- Reggie's prudent, so what? Oh yeah, I forgot King is black, he can't possibly directional punt. All he has is his natural gorilla like leg strength.

Mark will see to it TP6 gets a fair shot at the so-called open competition. By the sound of Marks' interviews, he's not gonna put up with any bull sh + t from Allen and if TP6 is the better QB, he'll start. Pryor is a favorite of Marks. May 9th, 2013 at 8:19 pm just like when he left here, woodson looking for whoever gives him the most $. can't blame him, but not the kinda player i'll root for I would welcoe Woodson back.

With the Prime Minister pushing for a snap general election the legislative programme presented at the State Opening of Parliament is being seen as a bid by Mr Johnson to set out his campaign agenda. As well as law and order issues, immigration and the environment were also major elements of the programme, which had already been extensively trailed. The package of 26 Bills include seven relating to crime and justice. These include legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse. The Queen said: \"New sentencing laws will see that the most serious offenders spend longer in custody to reflect better the severity of their crimes .\" A Sentencing Bill will change the automatic release point from halfway to two thirds for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violence or sexual offences. The Queen made the short trip to the Palace of Westminster from Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach accompanied by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Other measures outlined in the speech include strengthening environmental protections, improving the NHS, and raising living standards through increasing the national living wage to \u00a3 10.50 an hour. On adult social care, the Government has pledged to \"bring forward proposals\" for reform, but the lack of a specific Bill dealing with the situation is likely to draw fire from the opposition. At the same time ministers are preparing to rush through a Bill to ratify any Brexit deal Mr Johnson is able to agree this week in Brussels in time for Britain to leave on the EU on October 31. Ahead of the speech, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced he is planning to hold a Budget just six days after the UK's scheduled Brexit date. Mr Javid tweeted: \"On 6th November I'll deliver Britain's first Budget after Brexit and set out our plan to shape the economy and deliver our infrastructure revolution .\" With no Commons majority, it is questionable how much of the proposed legislation in the Queen's Speech ministers can get through Parliament before a general election. And there is a major question mark over whether MPs will pass the legislative programme, which will go to a vote after several days of debate. The law and order package includes a Bill to \"drastically\" increase the sentences for foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order, a move ministers say will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs. Proposed legislation will make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives who are the subject of an Interpol Red Notice without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant, a process that can take a minimum of six to eight hours. Initially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. However, the Government will be able to add other countries by statutory instrument. The programme includes a \"Helen's Law\" Bill, named after 22-year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in 1988, to deny parole to murderers who withhold information about their victims. The Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnson's unlawful suspension of Parliament last month. Mr Johnson said in a statement: \"People are rightly horrified by the spate of violent crime plaguing our streets, including the sickening rise in knife-related homicides .\" Other measures in the speech include:--Environment Bill setting legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and cut air pollution .--Immigration and Social Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill to end freedom of movement and introduce a points-based immigration system from 2021 .--Railway reform with a white paper setting out proposals to overhaul the current system of franchising and creating a new commercial model .--Action on building standards in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire with the establishment of a new regulator with powers to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of building regulations .--The NHS Health Investigations Bill will create a new independent body with legal powers to ensure patient safety .--Mental health reform to reduce the number of detentions under the Mental Health Act by ensuring more people get the treatment they need. Mr Johnson is promising to deliver on a pledge by his predecessor <mark>Theresa May</mark> to ensure all tips are paid to waiting staff following an outcry that some major restaurant chains--such as Giraffe and Prezzo--were keeping as much as 10% of tips paid by card. The Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill will put a legal obligation on restaurateurs to \"pass on all trips, gratuities and services charges to workers without deductions\". Labour has dismissed the decision to hold the speech before the Government goes to the country as a \"cynical stunt\". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \"This Queen's Speech is farcical .\" It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast. \"Meanwhile, ahead of the Queen's Speech Mr Johnson received a winter flu jab. 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2018010917_00305351_W", "names": {"Jimmy Kimmel": ["Q20793563", "Q4914"]}, "date": "2018-01-09", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/news/meryl-streep-confirms-mariah-carey-stole-her-seat-at-golden-globes/", "content": "by UPI 9 Jan 2018 0 9 Jan, 20189 Jan, 2018 Jan. 9 (UPI)--Meryl Streep says music superstar Mariah Carey \"stole\" her seat at the Golden Globes.
