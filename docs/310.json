The account of threatening behavior, not only toward Peterson Middle School Principal Susan Harris but also toward Superintendent <mark>Stan Rose</mark> and others, emerged in a hearing in Santa Clara County Superior Court. Harris is seeking to make permanent a temporary restraining order granted Sept. 24 against Stampolis, 48. \"He was angry and he was yelling and he was really pissed off,\" Harris said. As Stampolis moved closer, she said, \"I could feel his breath on my face ....I put my hands up.\" Santa Clara Unified School District's Board of Education board member Christopher Stampolis during a board meeting in the district board room in Santa Clara, Calif. on Thursday, May 30, 2013. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) (Nhat V. Meyer) She said she was afraid the visibly enraged Stampolis was going to hit or push her. Stampolis' gestures were caught by a campus security camera. Harris' attorney, Eugene Whitlock, introduced still photos from that recording. But Stampolis' attorney, Tomas Margain, suggested instead that his client had been signaling Harris to \"put it in writing\" by simulating a paper and pencil with his hands. \"People do it in restaurants,\" he said. More than 40 people, including former superintendents, principals, teachers and parents attended the hearing to support Harris, who said the interactions and lack of immediate direction from the Santa Clara Unified School District sent her to the emergency room in September with anxiety. Sunnyvale police Officer Todd Fekete and <mark>Brian Allen</mark>, a security guard hired by the school district, also talked with Stampolis, Harris testified. On Sept. 23, when Stampolis arrived on campus 40 minutes after school let out, the guard handed him a 14-day stay-away order from Peterson. During their conversation in the school office, Stampolis' son sat nearby, apparently doing his homework. Immediately afterward, Stampolis, an attorney, drove to the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety to try to have his son file a complaint against Harris, alleging false imprisonment. \"I felt this was another example of being harassed,\" Harris told the court. \"I felt like my job safety was at risk.\" Fekete testified that he told Stampolis that there was no merit to the false-imprisonment charge and would not take a report. Stampolis also filed a harassment claim against Harris. The school district hired an independent investigator, Thomas Newcomb, who cleared her of the accusation, she testified. Stampolis was elected to the Santa Clara Unified school board two years ago. To support Harris' request, Whitlock introduced documents indicating that Stampolis: Last month threatened <mark>Rose</mark>, telling him, \"I'm going to inflict as much pain as I can on you and your wife,\" Whitlock said. Threatened a parent who criticized his behavior at meetings of a school-site council. \"Stampolis got in her face and threatened to sue her,\" Whitlock said. Was the subject of a Peterson staff petition presented last month to the board to protest unsafe working conditions because of fear of Stampolis. Publicly accused another middle school principal of keeping a hidden bank account. A school district investigation cleared the principal and also showed a letter detailing the allegation was written by Stampolis but was signed by someone else. Followed home in his car a Santa Clara High junior who last year criticized Stampolis and other board members at a meeting. Whitlock also mentioned a 2006 case in Los Angeles. A clerk at a storage facility won a $35,000 settlement with Stampolis for aggressive, intimidating behavior. Judge Thomas E. Kuhnle refused to permit the playing of the 911 tape in that incident. Controversy has followed the public life of Stampolis, who previously served on the West Valley-Mission Community College District board. Last year, Santa Clara teachers angry at him staged a work slowdown. In 2012 former Santa Clara administrators and trustees who served with him took out ads opposing his candidacy. After his election, administrators who felt targeted by him left the district. In a telephone interview last month, Stampolis acknowledged that he may have been late a couple of times picking up his son since school started in August. Peterson requires that students leave campus or be picked up within 20 minutes of the end of the school day. But Stampolis also said that Newcomb's report will contradict the charges. \"All the staff concluded that I was cordial and pleasant to all staff,\" Stampolis said. The case was continued to Thursday afternoon with testimony from witnesses and with cross-examination."}, {"articleID": "2018120604_00325239_W", "names": {"Richard Tracey": ["Q7329532", "Q7329533"], "Brendan O'Connor": ["Q4961041", "Q4961043", "Q4961047"]}, "date": "2018-12-06", "url": "http://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/minister-slams-labor-protection-racket-after-union-high-court-failure-20181206-p50kmd.html", "content": "Minister slams Labor \"protection racket' after union High Court failure Minister slams Labor\" protection racket' after union High Court failure Larger text sizeVery large text size Federal Industrial Relations Minister Kelly O'Dwyer has accused the Labor Party of running a \"protection racket\" for union thugs, after the High Court threw out a CFMMEU appeal against a decision to impose maximum fines on the union and its law-breaking official. The militant Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union had sought leave to appeal a full Federal Court decision imposing a maximum $306,000 fine against the union, and $10,200 against the official who abused a site manager while breaching right-of-entry laws. Industrial Relations Minister Kelly O'Dwyer says Labor must distance itself from the militant CFMMEU. Alex Ellinghausen / Fairfax Media Credit: The High Court ordered the CFMMEU to pay the Australian Building and Construction Commission's legal costs of defending the application, which had sought to challenge the penalty imposed on the union and its former Queensland president Dave Hanna. Mr Hanna was found to have breached right of entry laws at a Brisbane construction site, squirting water in the face of the site manager and refusing to leave while firing off obscenities in the 2015 incident, saying: \"Take that phone away or I'll f--ing bury it down your throat.\" Advertisement Former CFMEU Queensland president Dave Hanna was hit with the maximum penalty for his \"abhorrent\" behaviour. ABCC Commissioner Stephen McBurney said the High Court's refusal to grant special leavevindicated the Commission, which Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has pledged to abolish if Labor wins the coming federal election. \"I will continue to seek the imposition of maximum penalties in appropriate cases to deter repeat offending by the CFMMEU and others,\" Mr McBurney said. Ms O'Dwyer agreed, saying the ABCC was \"a very important cop on the beat\" . \"It is very important that we have a regulator that is ensuring that we are putting an end to thuggery, bullying and intimidation on construction sites right across this country,\" she said. Ms O'Dwyer slammed Labor for its opposition to the ABCC, saying if elected it would \"want to run a protection racket for the CFMMEU who are engaged in what can only be described as thuggish behaviour. It shouldn't be tolerated.\" She said the courts had \"made very clear that the CFMMEU are one of the most recidivist unions in this country\" . \"They are up before the Federal Court time and time again,\" she said, repeating her call for Mr Shorten to distance himself from the CFMMEU. \"Even Bob Hawke, former leader of the union movement, has said that there needs to be a disassociation from the thuggish tactics involved,\" she said. Mr Hawke famously deregistered the Builders Labourers Federation when he was prime minister in 1986, a task the Coalition has been unable to achieve with the CFMMEU, which was known as the CFMEU before it merged with the Maritime Union in March. The vast majority of cases brought by the ABCC involve the CFMMEU, which paid $5.6 million in fines over the past financial year, as the main defendant. The government's Ensuring Integrity Bill, which would make it easier to deregister law-breaking unions, remains held up in the Senate and is not expected to pass, while employers have mounted a legal challenge against the CFMMEU merger. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, which supports the CFMMEU's tactics, is campaigning for a dramatic overhaul of the nation's industrial relations laws. Mr Shorten has promised to \"look closely\" at the union peak body's demands, including a return to industry-wide bargaining, ahead of Labor's national conference next weekend. Federal Circuit Court Judge Salvatore Vasta said while imposing the fines against Mr Hanna and the CFMMEU that it was \"the most recidivist corporate offender in Australian history\" . On appeal in the Full Federal Court, Justice <mark>Richard Tracey</mark> said the union had \"determined that its officials will not comply with the requirements of [the Fair Work Act] with which it disagrees\" and \"simply regards itself as free to disobey the law\" .

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told the Old Bailey on Monday that the alleged murder of the 28-year-old constable was\" a completely senseless killing \". Pc Harper died from multiple injuries when he was pulled along behind a car after responding to the reported theft of a quad bike from a home near the village of Sulhamstead in Berkshire. One witness mistakenly thought he had seen a bloodied deer attached to the car before realising it was a man being dragged along, the jury heard. Henry Long, 18, from Mortimer, Reading, and two 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all deny murdering the Thames Valley Police officer in August last year. Court artist sketch of Henry Long, 18 (left) (Elizabeth Cook/PA) Mr Altman told jurors:\" Late at night, on Thursday August 15 of last year, in Berkshire, 28-year-old Andrew Harper, a serving police constable of Thames Valley Police, was killed in truly shocking circumstances. \"With his ankles caught in a strap that was trailing behind a car being driven at speed along a country lane, he was dragged for over a mile along the road surface, swung from side to side like a pendulum in an effort to dislodge him, losing items of his police uniform along the way, with the rest of his uniform being quite literally ripped and stripped from his body.\" When, at last, he became disentangled, he was left with the most awful injuries, from which he died there on the road, surrounded by colleagues who tried in vain to save him. \"Mr Harper, left wearing only his socks and boots, suffered injuries that were unsurvivable, the court heard. The jury was told:\" This was a completely senseless killing of a young police officer in the line of duty. \"Long has admitted manslaughter, which the younger boys deny, and all three have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Several members of Pc Harper's family were in court as the prosecution case opened. Police and flowers left at the scene where Thames Valley Police officer Pc Andrew Harper, 28, died. (Dominic Lipinski/PA) Pc Harper, known as\" Harps \"to his colleagues, was part of Thames Valley's Roads Policing Unit, and had been due to work a 10am to 7pm shift that day. He was still on duty with crew mate Pc <mark>Andrew Shaw</mark> at 11.17 pm, and they were driving in an unmarked police BMW fitted with emergency lights. The pair, who were both wearing uniform, answered the call to the reported theft of the quad bike although it was past the end of their shift. Mr Altman said:\" Despite it being well beyond the end of their shift, because they were close and thought they could help, they responded to the call. It was a decision that was to cost Andrew Harper his life. \"Prosecutors claim that the three defendants had planned the theft, visiting the home of owner Peter Wallis earlier that day and taking steps to avoid being caught by police. It is alleged that having been challenged by Mr Wallis earlier in the day, they returned with items that could be used as weapons if they were challenged, including crowbars, an axe and a hammer. Mr Altman said:\" They were ready, as part of their planning, if necessary, to use the items they had brought with them as weapons if anyone stood in their way. \"Sensibly, Mr Wallis did not stand in their way this time.\" Pc Harper did try to stand in their way, and he paid the ultimate price for it. \"The court heard that the officers were driving along a country lane, Lambdens Hill, on their way to the call when they met a Seat Toledo, driven by Long, coming the other way. One of the 17-year-olds was in the passenger seat, and the other was riding the quad bike which was being towed behind the car, attached to the boot lid hinge with a crane strap that formed a loop. As the cars met, the teenager on the quad bike dismounted, disconnected the strap from the bike and tried unsuccessfully to get into the passenger door of the Seat, as Long began to drive off. Pc <mark>Shaw</mark> turned the BMW's emergency lights on, and the teenager ran to jump through the back passenger window of the Seat. As Pc Harper tried to stop him, the officer's feet were encircled in the crane strap, and he was dragged along as Long drove off. The court heard that Long drove at an average speed of 42.5 mph, leaving a snaking trail of tyre marks, blood and clothing as he swerved across the country lane. A driver who had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting the Seat as it crossed the A4 mistakenly thought Pc Harper was an injured deer. Mr Altman said:\" At first he thought there was a bloodied deer attached to the car, but quickly realised it was a person, trapped by both ankles, being dragged around the road and striking the kerb. \"Pc Harper was barely alive when he was found by his crew mate, and had suffered\" absolutely catastrophic, unsurvivable injuries \", the court heard."}, {"articleID": "2019012616_00021441_W", "names": {"Kevin Johnson": ["Q16197018", "Q1740182", "Q18630838", "Q18921997", "Q203286", "Q25413017", "Q28806784", "Q39070237", "Q448375", "Q6396616", "Q6396617", "Q6396618", "Q6396620", "Q6396621", "Q6396622", "Q6396623"]}, "date": "2019-01-26", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/26/heres-how-starbucks-is-driving-us-same-store-sales.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001", "content": "Here's How Starbucks Is Driving U.S. Same-Store Sales Growth The company has a three-pronged approach. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 26, 2019 at 10:46 AM Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has a three-step plan to drive same-store sales improvement in the United States. This includes enhancing the in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation, and driving digital relationships. Basically, the coffee chain wants to cut wait times in stores--especially during peak times--create new drinks or food items that entice consumers to either spend more or make an extra visit, and sign more people up for its loyalty programs. Those efforts are succeeding; the company is delivering 4% comparable-store sales growth in the U.S. \"We are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store transactions in the U.S., underpinned by our digital initiatives and improved execution of our in-store experience,\" said CEO <mark>Kevin Johnson</mark> on the first-quarter earnings release. Starbucks is working to take non-customer-facing work away from baristas. Image source: Starbucks. What is Starbucks doing? The chain's efforts to enhance the in-store experience focus on serving customers faster while continuing to build the connection between the consumer and in-store staff. To make that happen, Starbucks has been working to free up employee time to focus on customers. \"Our Starbucks store partners who proudly wear the green apron are at the center of connecting with customers and we are on a mission to support them by simplifying work and reducing some of the non-customer-facing tasks that historically have taken up to 40% of their time,\" said <mark>Johnson</mark> during the Q1 conference call. The changes made include shifting some cleaning tasks to after the stores have closed. in addition, Starbucks has automated \"product planning and replenishment which reduces store clutter and time away from customers.\" These changes will take multiple quarters to be fully implemented, but <mark>Johnson</mark> said that they are already paying off. \"Our customer connection scores continue to improve in Q1 on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. And importantly, across both, the morning and afternoon dayparts,\" he said. The company has also expanded its delivery pilot program. Ultimately, this should allow U.S. stores to increase comp sales, assuming the company can manage workflow to not impact in-store visitors. When it comes to beverage innovation, the company has focused on its cold drinks. <mark>Johnson</mark> said that cold beverages had gained momentum across multiple dayparts. \"The focus of our latest beverage innovation revolves around iced espresso, draft nitro beverages, and refreshers,\" he said. \"We have expanded the deployment of our nitro offering from about one-third of U.S. company-operated stores last quarter to 40% in just one quarter. And we remain on track to reach our goal of 100% penetration by the end of fiscal 2019.\" Digital relationships, the third growth driver, have been increasing as well. The company has collected 13 million customer registrations from people who use its WiFi but are not Rewards program members. The chain also added 1 million members to its Starbucks Rewards program, a 14% increase that brings total membership to 16.3 million. \"This result was driven by leveraging our increased digital reach, as well as a more seamless customer onboarding experience, greater mobile order and pay adoption, and enhanced personalization features,\" said <mark>Johnson</mark>. \"Between digitally registered and active reward customers, we are now approaching 30 million digital connections in the U.S.\" Steady as she goes <mark>Johnson</mark> has shown that Starbucks can continue to grow sales in a mature market. He also has a clear plan to continue doing that, though it's important to note that he has largely backed away from his predecessor's plans to add premium products to up to 20% of stores. That plan hasn't gone away, but it has been scaled back into more of a test. In theory, that leaves the company with another potential growth driver in its back pocket once it exhausts its current three-tiered approach. Daniel B. Kline has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Starbucks. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.
