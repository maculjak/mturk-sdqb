(AP)--Randall Royer grew up in the Midwest, a suburban St. Louis kid. By the time he was 21, he had converted to Islam and changed his name to Ismail Royer, fighting in Bosnia alongside fellow Muslims against Serbian ethnic cleansing. By the time he was 31, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping friends who wanted to join the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks. Now age 44 and out of prison, he remembers Bosnia as both a highlight of his life and the place that launched him on a disastrous path. \"There was so much meaning and purpose in what I was doing,\" he said of the Bosnian war. \"I spent so much time trying to recapture that feeling of Bosnia. It never came back .\" He remembers with pride the gratitude expressed by the Bosnian families whose homes he defended and says the war is one of those rare conflicts where there was a clear good guy and bad guy. Royer's search for the next Bosnia led him to Pakistan, where he joined the fight over Kashmir--a conflict that he said he viewed with ambivalence. Eventually, he came back to the U.S. and served as a spokesman for some of the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights groups. Royer was one of about a dozen young Muslims from the D.C. area who played paintball in the northern Virginia woods as a means of preparing for holy war. After the Sept. 11 attacks, a few members of the group traveled to Pakistan, and with Royer's help, got in touch with the militant group Lashkar-e-Taibi. Royer's friends' ultimate goal was to join the Taliban and help fight U.S. soldiers. Royer pleaded guilty in 2004 to aiding and abetting use of a firearm in a crime of violence and aiding and abetting the carrying of an explosive. He was never convicted of a terrorism-related charge--a distinction that is significant to Royer. \"When I look back at myself, I don't see myself as an extremist,\" he said. \"I see myself as being naive, romantic, a Don Quixote kind of guy .\" He points out that he has a long history of speaking out against al-Qaida, and he is equally critical of the Islamic State, which is now responsible for motivating and recruiting most of the lone-wolf terrorists who have popped up in the U.S. <mark>Michael Jensen</mark>, a researcher with the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, said he also sees a difference between Royer and the more modern iteration of Islamic extremists. He said Royer was drawn to localized conflicts like Bosnia and Kashmir, as opposed to the global jihadist vision espoused by al-Qaida or the Islamic State. Royer said what drew him to Islam in the first place was his view that it could be a vehicle for social justice. In the Muslim world, though, he said a quest for social justice gets twisted into a sense of victimization and even a persecution complex. \"If you're constantly blaming other people, you'll never change,\" he said. Tariq Nelson, a friend of Royer for more than 20 years, said Royer's desire to right wrongs on a global scale ultimately led him down the wrong path. \"He was an idealist who got caught--they all got in over their heads,\" Nelson said. \"To an outsider it sounds strange. Nobody wanted to be a terrorist. In fact they were anti-terrorist .\" More from this section Don't ask where Paula Vogel is. Ask where isn't she? 8:18 President Trump Participates in the White House Easter Egg Roll Man shot by law enforcement in West Virginia identified When the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, Royer said his Muslim identity led him to struggle with the question of whether being an American and Muslim were compatible. An Islamic scholar from northern Virginia, Ali Al-Timimi, advised the paintball group in the days after Sept. 11 that an apocalyptic clash of Muslim and Western civilizations was approaching, and that Muslim men should \"go be with the mujahedeen .\" It helped prompt Royer to return to Bosnia, and it prompted others in the group to seek Royer's help in joining Lashkar. In hindsight, Royer said, it was \"colossally bad advice .\" Al-Timimi was convicted of soliciting treason and sentenced to life in prison. While Royer was behind bars, he continued to do what he had always done. He debated philosophy and theology, and often found himself as the advocate for moderation and tolerance. He said he carried on debates with some of the most notorious criminals, including al-Qaida \"shoe bomber\" <mark>Richard Reid</mark>, passing notes from cell to cell because prisoners in his unit were kept in isolation. He plans to publish his correspondence with <mark>Reid</mark>, and wants to be a voice against Islamic extremism. He is learning social media and this week spoke to students at the University of Southern California about pathways to extremism. He figures that if he can get through to hardened criminals, he can get through to others. \"I think I was getting somewhere with <mark>Richard Reid</mark>,\" he said.", "articleID": "2017042008_00200863_W", "names": {"Michael Jensen": ["Q12326938", "Q25184073", "Q27613067", "Q290017", "Q38803509", "Q45319965", "Q58171472"], "Richard Reid": ["Q12067057", "Q16223393", "Q1930632", "Q42292599", "Q7328641", "Q7328645"]}}, {"date": "2017-04-20", "url": "http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a26100/women-in-technology/", "content": "Author Copy Created with Sketch.

Sara del Valle Molly Matalon Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Computational Epidemiologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory A program she learned to get there: C, C + +, Math Lab, Mathematica There are two pieces to my job. First, we use mathematical equations to describe how diseases spread. Then we use computer science to create simulations like what you see in computer and video games. We can ask, \"What happens if there's a virus in an airport? Or in a school?\" then simulate how the virus spreads. Usually we rely on code from existing packages, but sometimes we write our own from scratch. Even though I'm a mathematician, I lead a team of computer scientists, software developers, and statisticians. The software developers build the simulations and add new capabilities to the code. Once it's built, I run the code and analyze the results. It's a continuous back and forth. But the math itself is important, too: There are mathematical models that helped the nurse or physician come up with the vaccine you get or to determine when to administer shots. Mathematicians impact our daily life.

I knew then that was exactly what I wanted to do. In a regular live-action movie the director of photography does camera and lighting. In animation, I'm in charge of adding the lighting to the three-dimensional worlds we build movies in. It's the last creative step: The world is built, the characters are animated, and I add lights. I can make a scene look indoors or outdoors, overcast or sunny, fluorescent or candlelit. One important program we use at Pixar is called Maya. It helps our technical artists build models and do special effects and hair and cloth. It's great as a learning device because you can get a free student version that has essentially all the same tools we use as professionals. It's a highly capable piece of software.

We use images from satellites four hundred miles above Earth to look for changes in vegetation and soil. We classify pixels from the satellite images into groups--such as plants, soil, and buildings. The naked eye can identify things like compounds and pyramids, so we know where to send teams of archaeologists. It saves a lot of time and money over traditional digging. Eventually, I wanted to create a platform where anyone could discover ancient sites with satellite images. I created GlobalXplorer, which turns space archaeology into a game. Citizen explorers view a tile of land, then work to identify classifications. It connects people to places that are disappearing around the world. Leslie Ikemoto Molly Matalon Head of Machine Learning for Google Photos A program she learned to get there: C + +, Java To explain what I do in an example: We noticed that a lot of people accidentally take sideways photos, so we took a whole bunch of photos that we knew were right-side-up, and rotated them sideways or upside down. Then we showed millions of those examples to a machine-learning algorithm. Because we'd labeled all the data, the algorithm learned how to recognize a photo that was uploaded the wrong way and tell the user how to fix it. So my job, really, is knowing what algorithms are out there, and how to use them to solve problems. There's a diagram at the Computer History Museum near Google that shows the family tree of programming languages. There are so many, but if I were learning computer science today, the language that would be first on my list besides C + + and Java would be Swift. It's a new language that is very elegant. I think it will be the language of the future. You're gonna see it all over the place.

That foundation still matters, regardless of what technologies you use: Every car starts with a sketch on paper. From there a \"sculptor\" evolves it into math, and then into 3D. Designers coming out of school today can start with a sketch and render it in programs such as Alias, which can create a quick model, and Z-Red, which can apply textures, grains, and colors. We're also excited lately about virtual reality. It allows us to sit inside the environment of a car that doesn't exist yet. We can sit in the front seats, the rear seats. We can look up and see the headliner or out the windows to the road. We can simulate driving to assess visibility. If you're interested in VR, in sketching things, in gaming or animation, there's a place for you here. Erin Barra Molly Matalon Associate Professor of Songwriting at Berklee College of Music A program she learned to get there: ProTools, Ableton, Logic Technology has changed everything about the music industry. Until ten or fifteen years ago, the technology that was required to record and distribute music was expensive, and only a few select people had it. These days, everybody can be a producer. I was a musician for years, but I often felt like I didn't have the resources to make the music I wanted to make. I realized the barrier was that I didn't have control over the technology. So I decided that I was going to learn. The main tools I teach are ProTools, Ableton, and Logic, and they're all very specific for the type of music you want to create. If you're a singer-songwriter, I recommend Logic because it sort of holds your hand through the process and will make you sound good without too much effort. For people who want to make electronic music, I recommend Ableton. It's more an instrument than a piece of software. And then if somebody wants to work in a studio, I suggest ProTools, because that's what they use in professional environments.

I've always built and wired my own studios, and I started working with ProTools before it was ProTools. There are lots of ways you can get it free. I always encourage people to start with an online tutorial. Sound is fully immersive, but most people don't notice it. If you are watching a movie and a car rolls by, you'll hear the hum of the engine, the rolling of the wheels, and the grit on the ground and that's about it. Now imagine another similar car rolling by, but this one has a pebble in the wheel well. Even if you're not paying attention to the sound of it, you'll wonder to yourself for a split second, how'd that get in there? You can make all sorts of sonic analogies that support a story twist that way. Why We Should Be Excited About the Future An inspiring afternoon spent watching the girls of Girls Who Code. The Poly Prep Country Day School chapter of Girls Who Code meets on Wednesdays in Brooklyn in New York. As the sound of the bell fills a technology lab in the middle of campus, girls bob in in twos and threes. The lab looks much like a modernized woodshop, with blue rubber flooring, wheeled work tables, metal rolling stools, and a tool wall. Laurel Golio There are eleven girls today. Most are high school underclassmen, though the youngest is a seventh grader and the oldest is a senior. Some have been part of GWC all year; others just began last week, at the beginning of the spring semester. The girls gather around tables and pull out their laptops, many of them decorated with stickers. Girls Who Code is a national nonprofit with forty thousand participants throughout the United States. Each chapter follows an official curriculum: For example, each meeting begins with a lesson about a famous female scientist. This week, computer science teacher Jean Belford, the club's advisor, shows a trailer for Hidden Figures, the Oscar-nominated movie about black women who helped NASA launch <mark>John Glenn</mark> into orbit but got little credit for their work. \"Are women in science still overlooked today?\" she asks. \"That's why this club exists,\" says Rema Hort, a sophomore. For their yearlong project--each GWC club picks one at the beginning of the academic year and works on it together--the Poly Prep girls are building both a video game and a website for another club Poly Prep students are involved in called Focus. They are most excited about the game: They want it to be like Pac-Man--only instead of running from ghosts in a maze, the protagonist will chase and catch counselors. \"That's going to be hard,\" Belford says. \"But you can do it .\" Kristen Palmer (pictured above, center), a fifteen-year-old sophomore who's done more hackathons than she can remember, works on the game with freshmen Jessie Rose and Michelle Kwan. They use Scratch, a visual-programming language designed for students. As they organize purple, blue, and orange blocks of code in a column, Scratch, the orange mascot for the programming language (and a stand-in protagonist), begins to move over a photo of their school. Success! Throughout the two-hour session, girls call out to Sam Steinberg, a seventeen-year-old senior, for guidance. Steinberg enthusiastically advocated for the club at Poly Prep last year. She was the only girl in computer science class her freshman year, and boys would pick on her for answering questions correctly. She didn't like that, so she helped create a place where she (and other girls) wouldn't have to deal with it. Steinberg hops up to help seventh-grader Jasmine Kaur, who's spent the two-hour session coding an online application form for the Focus club. Steinberg scans over the lines, then launches a new window to test the code out. \"I'm so nervous, I hope it works,\" Steinberg says as they stare at the screen. \"Don't get your hopes up,\" Kaur says, laughing. A minute later, the application form is live. It works perfectly. This story appears in the May 2017 Popular Mechanics.

Photo by <mark>Robert Cohen</mark>, rcohen @ post-dispatch.com Two years ago, when the Blues played the Wild in the first round of the playoffs, everyone in the state of Minnesota, it seemed, hated Blues forward Steve Ott. Ott has made a career out of being a professional nuisance, and he was at his most annoying in that series. There he was trading shoves with former teammate Jordan Leopold, getting whacked in the leg by Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk for parking in front of the net, and somewhat mysteriously, petting the helmet of forward <mark>Jason Zucker</mark>. If there was one guy everyone wanted to take a swing at, it was Ott. Ott is gone now. He was an unrestricted free agent after last season, and the Blues didn't re-sign him, allowing him to agree to a one-year deal with Detroit. When the Red Wings weren't going to make the playoffs, they traded him to Montreal, where he's making another playoff run. His spirit lives on this season in the form of forward Scottie Upshall. He may not reach the standards Ott set, but he's been a royal pain in the keister. He's been called for three penalties and the Wild would probably maintain there should have been a few more. Late in Game 4, after a goalmouth scramble in front of Dubnyk, two Wild players sought out Upshall for some after-the-whistle shoving .\" He's doing a good job, \"said forward Ryan Reaves, a linemate of both Ott and Upshall .\" He's getting some good licks in on some of their top guys. I think he's getting in their grill. \"He's a pest .\" That's Upshall's job on the Blues' fourth line, alongside Reaves and Kyle Brodziak. The line has been the most consistent for the Blues all season and certainly the one that has played together the most. With all the line changing that goes on, there have been only a few games this season that when those three have been healthy they haven't been on the ice together. And in the playoffs, it's safe to say that the Wild have been aware when those three have been on the ice. \"That's playoff hockey,\" Upshall said. \"It happens. You play in between the whistles as much as you can. You provide energy .\" Our job as an energy line is to create energy, to stay out of the penalty box, and provide just the spark for our guys. Lately, I think we've been doing a good job of taking time away from the defensemen ....We're in Game 5 now, you start to feel things you didn't in Game 1, and that's what hockey's all about. You continue to play hard, play strong and you've got to be physical. \"Brodziak was on the Wild for that series two years ago, so he remembers Ott and sees some validity to the comparison .\" That's pretty fair, \"he said .\" He does his job well. I don't feel like he's getting out of his game, trying too hard to be a pest. Some guys when they feel they need to do something, go out of their way and end up doing something that's uncharacteristic or take a dumb penalty, but he's staying within his game, and at the same time finding ways to be physical and be a pain in the ass for the other team. \"You always want to have guys like that, capable of walking the line but not crossing over it. He's done a good job for us. If it gets the attention of the guys on the other team, or just awareness he's on the ice, it's going to be a hard shift, then he's done his job .\" Mike Yeo was the coach of Minnesota at the time and, at least publicly, acknowledged Ott's contributions. He feels much the same way about Upshall. \"I think he's trying to be physical,\" Yeo said. \"He's trying to impact games, and that's what he can do. We've said it before, that line, we need them to be good hockey players first and foremost. That's what they do for us when they're on top of their game. They can influence the play and disrupt the opposition because of their physicality. But you know, when they're on top of their game, they're also not running around, they're not chasing. They're managing the puck the right way .\" \"I think as a group, we've done a good job of playing good defensive hockey but also in-your-face, protecting the front of the net,\" Upshall said. \"They've got some big guys, big mobile defensemen that you've got to get licks on when you can. It's part of the game. As the playoffs go on it gets harder and harder but it becomes more fun .\" Reaves, a pest in his own right, noted that Upshall is a pest in general. \"He's a pest to everybody on this team, everybody on the other team,\" Reaves said. \"He's a pest. But he's doing a good job .\" He also noted that one of the reasons teams go after Upshall is because the alternative is to go after Reaves, who's an inch taller and weighs 25 pounds more. Upshall agrees. \"I accept that proudly,\" he said. \"It's a job that I enjoy to the utmost. It's fun going out there and playing hard and getting under guys' skin. This time of year it's all about winning games and doing what you can to help your team. It's a big role to fill .\" Apr 22, 2017 (...)

That's the way it happens after a loss. After a lackluster performance in a 3-1 loss in Game 3, the Rangers came out aggressive early in Game 4. \"I said to him,\" I'm proud to be your teammate \". The Blue Jackets have benefitted greatly from his services this year, and losing him is arguably one of the biggest blows they could suffer in the postseason. Nutivaara, a rookie, was making his playoff debut. It helped. They were able to maintain pressure pretty much all evening, and while the Penguins had their moments, they never seized momentum in the second and third periods the way they did in the first three games of the series .\" No matter what period we're in, we have to have the puck more \", Tortorella said .\" We just got to keep doing it \". He'll walk away from his rookie campaign with 11 goals and 47 points in 78 regular season games, good for sixth in scoring on the team and first among blue liners. BOSTON (AP) - <mark>Bobby Ryan</mark> scored on a tip-in on a power play 5:43 into overtime, and the Ottawa Senators recovered after giving up a three-goal lead to beat the Boston Bruins to take a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. Veteran goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, replacing injured starter <mark>Matt Murray</mark>, has been sharp for the Penguins and made a critical mask save of a potential game-winning Brandon Dubinsky shot in overtime Sunday. Corey Perry scored 1:30 into overtime and Anaheim rallied from three goals down to take a 3-0 series lead in the first-round series .\" When they get closer, we end up with a shift and score a goal \". They lost that series in seven games to Vancouver. The Blue Jackets will be seeing some changes in their lineup. There was less luck involved when Anderson made it 2-0 with a little over minute left in the period. He was waiting to the right of the net to collect a rebound on a shot by Jenner and beat Fleury to the glove side. But Kuhnhackl found the back of the net on a rebound less than two minutes later to make it 4-3 before Jenner put Columbus back up by two. The Pittsburgh Penguins will be looking to go with what worked, keeping most of their lines in tact for game four. Even when they would win series, they would too often leave the door open for opponents or let series go an extra game or two.
