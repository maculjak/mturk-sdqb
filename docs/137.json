"governor seeks to double fund to land tech firms by bob moen associated press / december 9, 2011 e-mail | print | text size - + e-mail e-mail this article to: invalid e-mail address add a personal

jobs to wyoming by proposing to double the money the state makes available to help build data centers and other digital facilities and broaden the types of firms eligible to tap the funds. mead said thursday he wants wyoming to be as \"attractive as possible to these companies\" to bring in jobs and new tax revenue. wyoming established a $15 million fund last year to help pay for infrastructure, such as water service, for new mega data centers after verizon communications inc. looked at locating a $4 billion data center near laramie. the company decided against building one for now after it acquired a separate company that already had data centers, and the state fund remained unused. mead's budget proposal released last week seeks to expand the fund to $30 million and broaden it to include other types of tech-related facilities. \"in doubling the funding there's more opportunity for big projects and also a pool of money for other technology projects,\" mead said through his spokesman renny mackay. <mark>robert jensen</mark>, ceo of the wyoming business council, said that while the fund hasn't been tapped yet these types of complicated projects take time and it's important the state has the money available. \"to have some funding in the governor's office that he has the ability to put toward infrastructure that supports their location here, that's good news and the industry will take note of that,\" <mark>jensen</mark> said. he said his office is actively talking with several data center operators about locating in wyoming. the discussion involved projects not as large as what verizon was looking at, but they are still \"significant,\" he said. \"anything can happen,\" <mark>jensen</mark> said. \"the point is that the industry is still viable. it's still growing. we still have a compelling package for them, and people are listening to us .\" he added broadening the fund could attract other types of technology firms, such as those that produce software .? copyright 2011 associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. e-mail e-mail this article to: invalid e-mail

"http://vcstar.com/news/2011/dec/12/voters-first-take-on-browns-tax-plan-is-poll/?partner=RSS", "content": "california voters, convinced that state budget cuts implemented in the past few years have affected government services \"a lot\" and concerned that the state should do more to ensure equal opportunity, are inclined to support gov. <mark>jerry brown</mark>'s proposal for a five-year increase in sales taxes and income taxes paid by those making more than $250,000 a year. those are among the findings of a survey released monday by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california, which interviewed 1,316 registered voters by telephone from nov. 29 to dec. 5. <mark>brown</mark> seeks to place the proposal, which would generate an estimated $7 billion a year in revenue, before voters in a ballot initiative next fall. his temporary measure calls for increasing income taxes on all individuals with incomes exceeding $250,000 by up to 2 percent and imposing a half-cent increase in the sales tax through 2017. initial public reaction is favorable, the poll found, with 60 percent of likely voters in support and 36 percent opposed. opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines, with 78 percent of democrats in support and 54 percent of republicans opposed. \"voters are starting off with a favorable response to this tax proposal,\" said pollster mark baldassare. \"voters feel that things are at a point where we need to be doing more. there's some sense of real concern about where we go next .\" he cautioned that the poll also revealed sentiment that will create a challenging environment for passage of a tax increase: \"low approval ratings of state elected officials and high levels of distrust in government .\" the poll suggests that voters are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of recent budget cuts on government services. nearly two-thirds (65 percent) believe that cuts enacted in recent years have \"affected a lot\" the ability of local governments and school districts to deliver services. another round of cuts is expected later this week, when the state department of finance releases its assessment of state revenues so far this budget year. it is widely expected that revenues will fall $1 billion or more below projections, a situation that will trigger contingency plans that will automatically reduce funding for higher education and various social services. if those revenues are more than $2 billion below projections, a significant cut to k-12 education also will be triggered. the poll suggests voters have little stomach for further spending cuts. when asked how best to deal with the budget shortfall, 45 percent of likely voters said it should be done through a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, 11 percent said it should be done mostly through tax increases, and 33 percent said it should be done mostly through spending cuts. additionally, the poll revealed a dramatic change in how the public perceives the availability of opportunity in california. a majority (54 percent) believes that \"state government should do more to make sure californians have an equal opportunity to get ahead,\" while 37 percent believe people already have equal opportunity. when the same question was asked in 2002, the sentiment was reversed: 52 percent said equal opportunity existed, while only 43 percent believed the state needed to do more to promote equal opportunity. trust in state government remains very low, the survey found. three-quarters of likely voters said they believe the state is \"pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves\" as opposed to the general public interest. and nearly two-thirds (63 percent) believe the state government wastes \"a lot\" of money. <mark>brown</mark>'s approval rating among likely voters remained steady at 46 percent, essentially unchanged from the 47 percent he received in january, even as unemployment has remained high and state services have been pared during his first year in office. the poll also showed strong support for public pension reforms proposed by <mark>brown</mark> this fall. among all adults, 70 percent approve of the notion that employees should pay an equal share of annual contributions to their pension funds and 68 percent favored changing retirement benefits for new employees to a 401 (k) - type savings plan instead of a defined pension. <mark>brown</mark>'s proposal calls for a hybrid of the two types of plans. even among the public employees surveyed, support for those two ideas topped 60 percent. on the national level, the poll found approval of president barack obama is about evenly divided among likely voters (48 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove), while approval of the job congress is doing dropped to an all-time low of just 9 percent, with 88 percent disapproving. among likely republican voters, former house speaker newt gingrich leads the contenders for the gop presidential nomination with 33 percent, ahead of former massachusetts gov. mitt romney at 25 percent and texas congressman ron paul at 9 percent. death penalty's cost to

offloading its half-share of the stock-tracking business that has become a well-known name since its ftse all-share index began recording britain's stock market movements in 1962. the buyout received a frosty response in the city, where lse shares slumped nearly 5 per cent amid concern that the exchange operator was paying over the odds. the transaction values the entirety of ftse international

high-growth, high-quality asset,\" he said. having been left out of a series of international stock market mergers in recent years, including a failed attempt to combine with the toronto exchange, the lse is keen to expand away from its core business of overseeing trading of london's shares. <mark>lester</mark> said: \"we want to take ftse from strength to strength. we want to build on it, invest in it and work with clients to become the no1 in the world .\" ftse, which stands for financial times stock exchange, has been a 50-50 joint venture between the lse and pearson since 1995. the business makes most of its money by assembling complicated indices at the request of city fund managers. it also gets a small royalty from all investment funds that track the ftse 100 index. based in

stake in interactive data, an american market data provider, last year. ftse international generated revenue of? 98.5 million last year and had assets on its balance sheet of? 100 million, almost all of which were accounting \"intangibles\" based on goodwill associated with its brand. experts were surprised about the aggressive <mark>price</mark> placed on the business. lorna tilbian, a numis

10-year-old fifth-grader from sioux city, iowa. treatment at the nebraska medical center started immediately, tearing him away from his friends, his school, his everyday life. this year, tax advisers agree, was benign in terms of changes to the internal revenue code. as is true every year, taxpayers should run a checklist for everything from selling securities that have lost money to taking advantage of annual gift allowances. but beyond the usual recommendations, tax advisers stress that you should use this year to get your affairs in order for what promises to be an uncertain two years of tax policy. \"for high-net-worth individuals, chances are the next year or so is going to be a challenging time,\" said <mark>chris johnson</mark>, head of u.s. wealth advisory at barclays wealth. \"there is going to be a lot of attention focused on ways to extract additional tax dollars .\" if congress does not act to extend a series of smaller tax deductions, next year could be costly for middle-income taxpayers as well. some of the more pressing issues to consider: what might expire after 2011 every year congress passes a series of so-called patches, renewing some 70 tax advantages for another year or two. in the past, this has been a formality, much as raising the debt ceiling used to be. this year, it remains to be seen what congress will do. mark luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at cch, a publisher of research and software for tax lawyers and accountants, noted that when these patches expired in 2009 and were re-enacted retroactively at the end of 2010, the delay wreaked havoc with tax planning. without a fix next year, said stephen baxley, director of tax and financial planning at bessemer trust, the amt \"will hit an additional 20 million people, and most of them are middle-income taxpayers .\" it normally claims around 4 million taxpayers. what changes in 2012 there are several provisions that take effect or lapse regardless of congressional action. one set to start in 2012 is a requirement that brokers report the purchase price on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to the irs for capital gains purposes. (they began doing this for stocks this year .) the default method of reporting is called \"first in, first out,\" which could result in higher capital gains taxes if those first shares were much cheaper than more recent ones. taxpayers have the option of electing other reporting methods, like \"last in, first out,\" which benefits people who bought shares over many years, presuming those shares have appreciated. there are also two significant tax advantages set to end. one is a loophole that allows people whose marginal tax bracket is under 15 percent to pay no capital gains tax when selling securities held for more than a year. the other break is a provision in the 2010 tax relief act that allowed 100 percent of an investment made in a private company to be free of capital gains taxes. this provision is a boon to venture capitalists who can reap millions in gains tax-free. what happens in 2013 in many ways, 2011 may be the calm before the storm. if congress and president barack obama continue to disagree, then the bush tax cuts automatically expire in 2013, raising taxes on income, capital gains and dividends and lowering the exemptions for estate and gift taxes. add to this the prospect of an additional 3.8 percent medicare surcharge on investment income. then again, the two sides could do something completely unexpected.", "articleID": "2011121606_00024321_W", "names": {"Chris Johnson": ["Q1077381", "Q1077389", "Q14849826", "Q22296293", "Q24006944", "Q2455991", "Q28203608", "Q2964750", "Q3662449", "Q47077990", "Q47847286", "Q4957157", "Q5107017", "Q5107019", "Q5107020", "Q5107021", "Q5107022", "Q5107024", "Q58149026", "Q766879"]}}, {"date": "2011-12-17", "url": "http://chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/uk-world-news/2011/12/17/nao-to-probe-northern-rock-sale-59067-29970719/", "content": "dec 17 2011 the controversial sale of state-owned bank northern rock will be investigated by the public spending watchdog, it has been confirmed. amyas morse, the head of the national audit office (nao), said he would examine the deal to sell the bank to sir richard branson's virgin money for? 747 million. labour has questioned the timing and value for money of the agreement, which leaves taxpayers facing a potential? 400 million-plus loss. shadow financial secretary <mark>chris leslie</mark>, to whom mr morse confirmed the probe in a letter, called for the sell-off to be delayed so that it could be pre-assessed by the nao. but the watchdog said that its role confined it to auditing a completed sale and it could not intervene in the process. chancellor <mark>george osborne</mark> insists the sell-off represents good value for money and blames labour for pushing him into a rapid disposal of the bailed-out institution. an unpublished agreement with the eu meant the government was bound to dispose of at least half of the bank, which was nationalised three years ago, by the end of 2013, he complained. in the letter, mr morse told mr <mark>leslie</mark>: \"i can confirm that i have decided to conduct a value for money study in relation to the creation and sale of northern rock plc.\" my team will certainly consider the points which you raise when conducting the study. \"however, my role in conducting value for money studies is to act as an auditor, in this case of the completed sale transaction .\" keep up to date with the news. sign up for", "articleID": "2011121718_00031265_W", "names": {"Chris Leslie": ["Q2521367", "Q749759"], "George Osborne": ["Q18527503", "Q332493", "Q47452635", "Q5543055"]}}, {"date": "2011-12-21", "url": "http://lfpress.com/news/canada/2011/12/21/19151801.html", "content": "man found guilty of murdering t.o. philanthropist philanthropist glen davis was shot in a midtown toronto parking garage on may 18, 2007.
