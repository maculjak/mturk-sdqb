Picture: Getty Cricket Aussie superheroes skittle England by Selina Steele in Hove 29th Jul 2019 6:10 AM premium_icon Subscriber only 0 WHAT'S better than one superhero? Two of course. Which is exactly what the Southern Stars have in Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry. Meg Lanning of Australia dives to make her ground as <mark>Amy Jones</mark> of England takes the bails off during the 2nd Vitality Women's IT20 in Hove, England. Picture: Getty Australia was experiencing a little wobble at 3-35 until Perry joined Lanning for an unbeaten 87-run partnership to claim victory in the second Ashes T20 international. While Lanning's T20 World record of 133 not out was all muscle and force, her knock today at County Ground, Hove was calculated grit. The seven wicket win came with 2.1 overs to spare, Perry finishing on 47 not out and Lanning on 43 not out. But England had its chance with Lanning. If only stand-in keeper <mark>Amy Jones</mark> had the forethought to backhand the ball at the stumps a-la Alyssa Healy. Natalie Sciver of England is bowled out by Georgia Wareham of Australia during the T20 in Hove. Picture: Getty Instead, Lanning survived a run-out scare without having faced a ball. It would have been a diamond duck but Lanning's full body dive, Kate Cross's wide throw and <mark>Jones</mark>'s reach for the stumps were enough to save the Aussie skipper. At that stage Austalia was 1/23. At first it seemed far fetched when England coach <mark>Mark Robinson</mark> said Australia was just a side that were gifted \"God given physical attributes\". Perhaps he was right and this dominance was delivered on divine intervention. Perhaps he was wrong and it was the years of training, preparation and strong domestic competition. Georgia Wareham of Australia celebrates with her teammates. Picture: Getty Either way, Australia continued its summer of dominance with Ellyse Perry becoming the first player, male or female, to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. \"I guess it's lovely, but I wasn't aware of it,\" Perry said. \"I actually think in T20 cricket at international level, we probably play it as much as the men, so I have played a pretty big volume of games now - over 100, so I suppose when you have played 100 games you might get close to it. Ellyse Perry became the first player to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. Picture: Henry Browne/Getty Images\" That's probably the only reason I'm there - because I've played a lot of games. \"It has just been really nice to turn up every game and for us to perform and to find a way to win and win dominantly .\" It was really cool to be out there with Meg. I really enjoy batting with her and she's incredible when she's going. To be at the other end is quite easy really. \"Here's how the game unfolded: IN A SNAPSHOT: England won the toss and perhaps fearing another Meg Lanning masterclass, and the game being over in six overs, decide to bat. On the back of Tammy Beaumont, they bat through the 20 overs finishing 8-121. A six in the final over from Sophie Ecclestone sets Australia a run rate of 6.10. Meg Lanning strikes good form during the first game of the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty After a shaky start, Lanning and Perry to put together a chanceless partnership of 87 to guide Australia to victory. BUNNY BAIT: Australia's Ellyse Perry, opening the bowling, bewitched <mark>Amy Jones</mark> for the fourth time this series. With zero footwork, <mark>Jones</mark> spooned a catch to Georgia Wareham at cover point and England was 1/1 after the first over. THE HEROES: Lanning and Perry. Ridiculously talented, ridiculously smart, ridiculously patient. The composed pair happily waited for the bad ball, which inevitably would come, and easily ticked off the run a ball needed. Beth Mooney has been another star for Australia in the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty A six in the 15th over from Perry saw Australia needing 18 off 28 and it was all over bar a Pimm's to celebrate. SUPPORT ACTS: * Jess Jonassen's wicket in her first over, getting rid of Danni Wyatt, was due to the hot hands of Beth Mooney. Mooney running back with flight of the ball judged the catch perfectly. But ouch - this is where we don't mention her dropping Tammy Beaumont when Beaumont was on 35. But we do have to mention Mooney dropping Beaumont again on 39. Both chances were not as difficult as the one she held. Jonassen takes matters into her own hands and bowls Beaumont for 43 in the 12th over. * Warm up? What warm up! Georgia Wareham snared the dangerous Nat Sciver first ball. The England all rounder went across her stumps to glance the ball down fine leg but completely missed the ball. The leggie then backs this up by snaring England captain <mark>Heather Knight</mark>. Easy as you like, Wareham takes a gentle return catch after <mark>Knight</mark> came at her down the pitch. THE RECORD That player again - Perry. Ellyse Perry received player of the match for Australia in the recent Test against England and is setting records in the T20 arena. Picture: Getty Perry is the first player, either male or female, to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1000 STATE OF PLAY The post-mortem has already begun for England - records have fallen all series and all in favour of the Australians. England's domestic structure is being questioned while Australia's lauded. In comparison, The Southern Stars have set themselves up for a dynasty. Headlined by superstars Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry, and with the likes of Sophie Molineux and Georgia Wareham coming through it's hard to see other nations catching them. NEXT UP: 3rd T20 International at Bristol on July 31. More green and gold dominance. Can't see where England will find any improvement. Australia to go through the series undefeated.

Johnson - @ rickerthewriter - Just Now Beginning today (Thursday, August 1), terminally ill adults in the state of New Jersey will be allowed to ask their doctors for prescriptions for medication to help end their lives. The law goes into effect today after New Jersey Gov. <mark>Phil Murphy</mark> signed the Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act that was passed by lawmakers earlier this year. The bill allows for any patient who has a diagnosis of six months of fewer to live to request life-ending medication from the doctors. The law requires the patient undergo counseling by either a psychiatrist or psychologist in order to determine whether the patient has the mental capacity to make such a decision. If approved the patient can get a prescription of a series of self-administered pills that can be taken at home. \"Allowing residents with terminal illnesses to make end-of-life choices for themselves is the right thing to do,\" said Governor <mark>Murphy</mark> when he signed the bill in April. \"By signing this bill today, we are providing terminally ill patients and their families with the humanity, dignity, and respect that they so richly deserve at the most difficult times any of us will face .\" The bill has floated around the New Jersey legislature stretching back to 2014, but this was the first time it made it to the state Senate for a vote. It narrowly passed, with many concerned about its effects. Supporters on the other hand, including several terminally ill patients cheered the law when it was passed. \"Just having this option is a godsend that will enable me to live the rest of my life, however long it is, as fully as possible knowing I won't have to suffer needlessly at the end,\" said supporter Susan Boyce, a Rumson resident who has a terminal lung disease. Several other states in the U.S. allow physician-assisted suicide including: California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Montana, Colorado, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Another nineteen states are reportedly considering similar physician-assisted suicide bills.

Photo: Reuters Reuters, Seoul North Korea fired missiles for the third time in eight days on Friday, a series of launches that analysts say are designed to improve military capabilities and pressure the United States and South Korea as they seek to restart denuclearisation talks. US President Donald Trump, who has been hoping to revive the stalled talks with North Korea, played down the launches. The North has been testing missiles despite Trump's June 30 meeting with North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark>, where they agreed to revive the talks. South Korea's government said the latest projectiles fired by the North appeared to be new short-range ballistic missiles. The missiles flew 220 km (135 miles) and reached an altitude of 25 km (15 miles), the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in Seoul said. A US official said US intelligence had detected at least one projectile, and possibly more, that did not pose a threat to North America. US officials said initial information indicated they were similar to two other short-range missile tests by Pyongyang since last week. North Korean state media said <mark>Kim</mark> oversaw the firing of what it described as a new large-calibre, multiple-launch guided rocket system on Wednesday. He also observed the launch of a short-range ballistic missile last week. The launches appear to be intended to put pressure on South Korea and the United States to stop planned military exercises later this month and offer other concessions. <mark>Kim</mark>'s government was not only signalling negotiating demands with the tests, it was assiduously improving military capabilities, said Leif-Eric Easley, an international relations professor at Seoul's Ewha University. \"The aim is not only to increase Pyongyang's ability to coerce its neighbours, another goal is to normalise North Korea's sanctions-violating tests as if they were as legitimate as South Korea's defensive exercises,\" Easley said. Trump was asked at the White House before he set off for a campaign trip to Ohio if he thought <mark>Kim</mark> was testing him and said the launches did not violate the North Korean leader's promises to him. Trump said they were short-range missiles. \"We never made an agreement on that. I have no problem,\" he said. While Trump says he never made an agreement on short-range missiles, the 15-member United Nations Security Council unanimously demanded in 2006 that North Korea suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme and \"re-establish its pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on missile launching\". The <mark>UN</mark> Security Council met behind closed doors in New York on Thursday to discuss the latest missile launches. Representatives from Britain, France and Germany called on North Korea after the meeting to engage in meaningful talks with the United States and said international sanctions need to be fully enforced until Pyongyang has dismantled its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said on Friday no immediate impact was seen on Japan's security after North Korea's latest launch. No ballistic missiles had reached Japan's territory or its exclusive economic zone, it said in a statement.

The 29-year-old journalist was shot dead by dissident republicans in April just weeks before her book, Angels With Blue Faces, was due to be published. Her murder while observing a riot in the Creggan area of Londonderry sparked outrage across the world. Irish President Michael D Higgins, former prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were among the mourners who attended her funeral. The book follows an investigation by Ms McKee into the murder of Ulster Unionist MP <mark>Robert Bradford</mark> in 1981, and examines speculation that he had been about to expose details of people involved with the abuse of children at the east Belfast boys' home Kincora. Lyra McKee was killed while observing a disturbance (Chiho Tang/Oranga Creative/PA) In the book, Ms McKee writes that she began her research when she was 22 years old and was inspired to write a non-fiction story that read like a novel. Her sister Nichola Corner said they were so proud to see her book in print but wished she was there to share the moment .\" We're extremely proud of her, it's obviously very bittersweet that she is not here with us to hold it because the book had meant so much to her and had circumstances been different we would have been celebrating this achievement with her. Unfortunately she isn't here to celebrate it but that doesn't meant we are not still proud of her. \"Our pride continues and we are so pleased she got it into a print version because she wanted it so much for so long for other people to read the story as well .\" Ms Corner said her sister came upon Mr <mark>Bradford</mark>'s murder while investigating another story at the Linenhall Library in Belfast.
