Mystics (5-7) led much of the first three quarters. Washington, the least effective three-point shooting team in the league, went 7 of 10 from long range en route to a 39-34 halftime lead. But the Mystics went cold for nearly six minutes in the fourth quarter under stiffer defensive pressure, and the Dream took advantage. \"We (made) them stop shooting, got in their faces,\" McCoughtry said. \"We would rather let them have 2s than 3s, so that kind of helped us .\" Atlanta held Washington to 1-of-7 shooting from three-point range in the second half. \"I think our defense just stepped up a little bit; we started getting up on the shooters,\" Dream Coach <mark>Michael Cooper</mark> said. \"We changed our pick-and-roll (defense) from one to another, and it really helped .\" Tiffany Hayes added 11 points for Atlanta, and Erika de Souza had 10 points and eight rebounds. Rookie point guard Bria Hartley led Washington with 16 points, and Emma Meesseman added 15. Mystics rookie Stefanie Dolson, who scored eight points on 4-of-5 shooting in 20 minutes, pushed the lead to 66-63 on a runner with 7 minutes 37 seconds left. But the visitors went scoreless over the next 5:49. McCoughtry's 11-foot fadeaway jumper from the left baseline with 6:39 left gave Atlanta the lead for good, 67-66. Washington went 3 for 4 at the free throw line, while Atlanta was 20 for 23, including 7 of 7 by McCoughtry. \"When the free throw difference is 23-4, it's hard to make up for it,\" said Washington Coach Mike Thibault, whose team lost for the fifth time in six games. \"They were aggressive, drove well SECTION: {section = sports, subsection = null}!!!

Johann \"Hans\" Breyer, a retired toolmaker, was arrested Tuesday outside his home in Northeast Philadelphia. He spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court, wearing an olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane. ADVERTISEMENT Legal filings unsealed Wednesday in the U.S. indicate the district court in Weiden, Germany, issued a warrant for Breyer's arrest the day before, charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder. Each count represents a trainload of Nazi prisoners from Hungary, Germany and Czechoslovakia who were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau between May 1944 and October 1944, the documents said. \"There was a heightened execution of Jewish deportees brought to the camp,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Foulkes told WTXF. \"Most of them were women, children and people with illness .\" Prosecutors say that Breyer, 18 at the time, served in the so-called Death's Head Guard Battalion at the camp. Attorney Dennis Boyle argued his client is too infirm to be detained pending a hearing on his possible extradition to Germany. Breyer has mild dementia and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes, Boyle said. \"Mr. Breyer is not a threat to anyone,\" said Boyle. \"He's not a flight risk .\" But Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice ruled the detention center was equipped to care for Breyer, who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature of the hearing. Breyer has admitted he was a guard at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II, but has told The Associated Press he was stationed outside of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million Jews and others behind the gates. <mark>Thomas Walther</mark>, a former federal prosecutor with the special office that investigates Nazi war crimes in Germany, now represents family members of some of Breyer's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case. He called for a speedy extradition. \"The German court has to find late justice for the crimes of Breyer and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs,\" <mark>Walther</mark> wrote in an email to the AP. \"It is late, but not too late .\" Prosecutors in Weiden could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Their investigation comes after years of failed U.S. efforts to have Breyer stripped of his American citizenship and deported. A court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the United States, mainly on the grounds that he had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it. His American citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born. During Breyer's arrest Tuesday, he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in his home that document his right to stay in the U.S., Donnelly testified. Breyer's wife and two grandsons attended the hour-long hearing in Philadelphia on Wednesday. His extradition hearing was scheduled for Aug. 21. Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, said he hoped there would be no obstacles to Breyer's extradition and trial overseas. \"Germany deserves credit for doing this - for extending and expanding their efforts and, in a sense, making a final attempt to maximize the prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators,\" he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 1 89-year-old man arrested on charges of aiding Nazi atrocities 2 Remains of 17 service members recovered from decades-old Alaska Globemaster crash 3 Sex offender apprehended with girl, 16, after high-speed chase 4 Oregon cat braves coyote country to make way to old home Should I Put My Vacation on a Credit Card?

Brooke Herbert Hayes | Staff Photographer Lilly Hale, 7 and her mother, Amy of St. Charles hold a bag containing a fish during the \"What's in the Aquarium?\" program at the St. Charles Public Library on Monday. The program invited children to learn about the new aquarium that was installed on Mother's Day. On Monday afternoon, more than 25 children gathered with their parents at the St. Charles Public Library for the \"What's in the Aquarium?\" program, organized by the library's youth services director, A. Denise Farrugia. On Mother's Day, a new aquarium tank was installed at the library, replacing one installed in 1988. The new tank was a gift from the Junior Friends, a group of middle school student volunteers in St. Charles. During the program, Farrugia read the story, \"Memoirs of a Goldfish,\" as the children huddled around on the floor in their parents' laps. Afterward, Grant Bedow, who maintains the aquarium, talked to the children about the types of fish in the tank and let them hold bags filled with new fish that were to be placed in the tank later that day. On a wall was a gallery called \"Mail for Library Fish Friends,\" a collection of letters written from children during the aquarium renovation. After the program, children gathered around the aquarium as Bedow dropped the creatures into their new home in the tank. <mark>Martin Sullivan</mark>, 1, of St. Charles excitedly pointed out all the fish to his mother, Jill. \"He loves the aquarium,\" she said. \"This is his favorite thing to do at the library .\" ) We are now using Facebook comments to offer a more inclusive, social and constructive discussion.

AP Photo/Corpus Christi Caller-Times, Todd Yates June 5: Forensic team members record measurements from an archeological dig at the Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias, Texas, where the graves of unidentified immigrants have been found. AP Photo/University of Indianapolis, Guy Housewright June 25: A marker with \"<mark>John Doe</mark>\" marked the grave of an unidentified immigrant at a cemetery in Falfurrias, Texas. The mass graves of suspected unidentified immigrants buried haphazardly in a South Texas cemetery and uncovered this month by anthropologists should be secured by state police until a criminal investigation can be carried out, a Texas lawmaker said Sunday. State Rep. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, said he had asked the Department of Public Safety to secure the cemetery in Falfurrias following revelations of human remains buried in garbage bags and multiple remains put in a single body bag without proper records. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said Sunday in an email that, \"the Texas Rangers plan to meet with local officials Monday to determine the proper course of action .\" ADVERTISEMENT Baylor University anthropologist Lori Baker and Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Indianapolis, worked with their students at the cemetery this month in an ongoing project to identify immigrant remains along the U.S.-Mexico border. The teams worked in Falfurrias last year as well and found similar practices. \"There's no question in one way or another that this is illegal, whether it violates the actual penal code or it if constitutes fraud,\" Canales said. The remains were buried by the Funeraria del Angel Howard-Williams, which has offices in Falfurrias and Hebbronville, Baker said Friday. Both Brooks and Jim Hogg counties contracted with the funeral home to bury unidentified remains there. \"This is not a respectful way of interring someone's remains,\" Baker said. \"And we had one, of course, with all of these bags on top of bags this year and not in a coffin. Most of these remains were not within a coffin, they were buried just in the body bags or whatever else they were recovered in .\" 52 graves this month, but will not know how many individuals they have until they are inventoried at the lab. A message left at Howard-Williams over the weekend was not returned. The funeral home's Houston-based parent company, Service Corp.. International, did not immediately respond to an email message Sunday. Service Corp.. International told the Caller-Times in a statement, \"No matter if this is one of our client families we serve on a traditional basis or a migrant family's loved one we're serving and we don't have any identification of the loved one, I do want to let you know it is our policy to treat the decedent with care, to treat them just like we would treat anyone else .\" State Sen. Chuy Hinojosa, D-Corpus Christi, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times on Friday that he was calling for a criminal investigation. Hundreds of immigrants' have been recovered on the ranches in Brooks County in recent years. Smugglers guide immigrants through the brush trying to circumvent a Border Patrol highway checkpoint an hour's drive north of the border. There is little water and the walk can take two or three days in punishing temperatures. Canales said he had also submitted a public records request to the Brooks County auditor on Saturday for records that would show how many bodies the county had paid the funeral home to bury. 1 Electrical worker makes surprising discovery at substation 2 Man walks into NYC McDonald's with knife in back 3 Economy in freefall? 1Q revision shows shrinkage of 2.9% 4 Suspect in Mass. teacher killing \"foaming at the mouth' after attack on clinician, report says Money-Saving Budget Tips for the Summer General Mills Launches\" Formal Review' of Costs", "articleID": "2014062602_00038913_W", "names": {"John Doe": ["Q23727991", "Q3181360"]}}, {"date": "2014-06-25", "url": "http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mag-silver-reports-voting-results-203000187.html", "content": "VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 25, 2014) - MAG Silver Corp.

Friday's World Cup quarterfinal between France and Germany is a repeat of one of the most iconic and dramatic games in World Cup history: the 1982 World Cup semifinal, notable for German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher's horrific challenge on Patrick Battiston, which left the French substitute unconscious, with two teeth knocked out and three cracked ribs. Schumacher was not booked and referee Charles Corver did not even award a foul ., Ben Lyttleton details how each of the key players in that game saw the Schumacher/Battiston episode, and how it affected their mindset going into the shootout. In this excerpt, he explains what happened after the final whistle. The game had finished at 23:41 local time, which goes some way to explaining why the Schumacher incident barely registered in the next day's analysis. \"Fabuleux!\" ran L'Equipe's headline, praising the France team for its attacking verve and coach Michel Hidalgo for fielding three playmakers in Alain Giresse, Michel Platini, and Bernard Genghini. \"One day later, the mood changed as the severity of Schumacher's challenge took top billing .\" Red-handed! \"was L'Equipe's front page, with an image of Schumacher's hip making contact with Battiston's jaw .\" A story of unpunished violence ....Schumacher was a brute. It's a morality tale which we will tell our children. \"Hidalgo changed his tone from valiant loser to angry victim .\" You say Corver is an international referee? I have my doubts, if he risks the safety of the players like that. \"L'Equipe's switchboard was jammed with anti-German calls and cars with German number-plates parked in French campsites had tires slashed and windows broken. To improve relations, Chancellor <mark>Helmut Schmidt</mark> sent an open letter of condolence to President Francois Mitterand .\" Our hearts go out to the French, who deserved to go through just as much as the Germans. \"French defender Patrick Battiston lies on the ground while waiting for the medical staff to come during the 1982 World Cup semifinal soccer match between West Germany and France. After Italy had beaten West Germany in the final -\" Justice! \"crowed L'Equipe - someone had the bright idea to send Schumacher on a diplomatic mission to France to apologize in person. Schumacher travelled to Metz on the day before Battiston's wedding and presented him with an FC K\u00f6ln pennant and an apology. But the trip was not a success .\" Schumacher forgets himself, \"said German magazine Kicker .\" It was a gesture of reconciliation with unpleasant consequences. \"The pair were photographed sitting next to each other at a hastily arranged press conference, looking in opposite directions. Schumacher, objecting to questions from the French press, cut the conference short .\" This is something that concerns only Battiston and me, \"he said .\" If I had known, I would have brought my own German journalists with me. \"The peace offering had turned ugly .\" The bad guy just wanted to poke fun at the good guy, \"wrote One day after the failed reconciliation, Mitterand considered asking Hidalgo to get his players to state publicly that they had no problem with Schumacher. Hidalgo had his response ready:\" What, shall I ask them to take the Germans on holiday with them? \"That gave France Football magazine an idea: It asked the France team where they would take Schumacher on holiday. Here are the answers: Platini: To climb the Grandes Jorasses mountains [in Mont Blanc]. Maxime Bossis: To scale the heights of the Vall\u00e9e Blanche [in Mont Blanc]. Dominique Rocheteau: To watch a sunset from the cliffs of \u00e9tretat. Marius Tr\u00e9sor: To do a parachute jump with a delayed opening. Battiston: To help me pick mushrooms in the forest as I still can't bend down. It does not take a mastermind of psychology to spot the common theme. Platini, the French captain, believes that France needed to lose this game-which in French folklore is simply referred to as Sevilla 82-to help them win their first competitive trophy, the European Championship, two years later .\" The legend of this game comes from the fact that we lost it, \"said Platini .\" In losing it, we became a great team. It was the end, but also the beginning of something. In the history of French football, the two turning points were Sevilla 82 and the 1998 World Cup final. Sevilla marked a generation of football fans, gave them a collective state of mind: it's why books and plays have been written about the game. No movie in the world could have provided as much conflicting emotion as Sevila 82. It's certainly a beautiful moment in my career. It's the moment that makes you say afterwards, \"I'm glad I was there!' Even if you lose .\" The heroic failure inspired creativity. France's 1982 defeat indeed spawned books, documentaries, plays and music, all created by a generation for whom the game was a defining moment. In 2006, scenic-representation artist Massimo Furlan pretended to be Platini in his performance Number 10, in which he mimed the France midfielder's pass to Battiston, reaction to his injury, and his penalty kick, in an empty stadium save for one observer: the coach Hidalgo, watching from the sideline. Red, a French musician, played a concert he called Sevilla 82 against a visual backdrop of the game. France-Allemagne was a play examining the relationship between the two countries, set in a Frenchman's living room as he entertains a German guest with the game on in the background. French choreographer <mark>Pierre Rigal</mark>, who was nine in 1982, produced a dance piece, Injury Time, which he took to Potsdam in Germany. \"I remember it as a great injustice and frustration, an event that went beyond sport,\" he said, \"and my piece was a way of looking at how we treat childhood memories .\" Twenty-seven years after the game, totally out of the blue, Battiston received a package from his old teammate Platini. It was his full kit from the game-blue shirt, white shorts with the distinctive circled number three, and red socks-which had been left in the dressing room, kept in a Seville museum, and then presented to Platini on one of his UEFA presidential trips. Battiston was emotional when he opened it; the kit now hangs in his son's bedroom. Schumacher also gave Battiston his goalkeeping jersey before a friendly between the two sides in Strasbourg in April 1984. Battiston has no idea where it is now, or even if he still has it. by Ben Lyttleton, out now from Bantam Press. 1.

He just waited for the storm - in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. <mark>Richard Neal</mark> is owner of Frying Pan Tower, an old U.S. Coast Guard tower anchored about 35 miles east of Wrightsville Beach, and on Thursday he provided play-by-play on his Facebook page as the hurricane roared almost directly over his station. \"This is quite a storm,\" <mark>Neal</mark> said at one point Thursday evening, after a weather station at his tower registered a wind gust of 99 mph. \"We just entered the eye of Arthur!\" he wrote in a Facebook post shortly before 6 p.m. <mark>Neal</mark> paid $85,000 for the rusting station in an auction in 2010, converting it into a bed-and-breakfast for people who love the ocean and those looking for an up-close fishing expedition. The station, which is 140 feet off the ocean surface, was abandoned by the Coast Guard in the late 1970s. <mark>Neal</mark>, a software sales engineer, decided to ride it out Thursday on his tower. As the center of Hurricane Arthur approached during the afternoon, <mark>Neal</mark> continued to provide updates on Facebook. He reported 24-foot waves about 4 p.m. and then the 99-mph gust nearly two hours later. About the same time, he said a government buoy apparently broke loose from its anchor and drifted by. \"NOAA Buoy No. 16 just slid past us, heading toward the Wrightsville beaches,\" he reported on Facebook. A short time later, he posted video of the buoy being carried away by huge waves. His reports quickly caught the fancy of weather followers and national media. ABC News showed the video on its evening news, and <mark>Neal</mark>'s video was the rage on weather Internet bulletin boards. \"This is like a getaway to me,\" Wood said in a 2012 Charlotte Observer story. \"I got up at 7:30 and worked until the sun went down.
