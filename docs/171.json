This comment goes further than what Comey wrote in his book, in which he says, \"Like many others, I was surprised when <mark>Donald Trump</mark> was elected president. I had assumed from media polling that Hillary Clinton was going to win. I have asked myself many times since if I was influenced by that assumption. I don't know. Certainly not consciously, but I would be a fool to say it couldn't have had an impact on me .\" Clinton previously has said that she thinks the letter Comey sent to Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, announcing that the FBI would be looking back at the email investigation, just 11 days before the election, killed her chances of winning. When asked about if the letter had done so, Comey said \"I hope not. I don't know. I honestly don't know. I sure hope not .\" Comey said that part of the reason he chose to write a book about his experiences was to share his perspective, and he hopes readers \"try to realize that I'm not trying to help a candidate or hurt a candidate; I'm trying to do the right thing .\" When asked if he would still release the letter if he knew that doing so would help elect <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, Comey said, \"I would. I would .\" He said that on the morning that they were going to release the letter, a colleague asked him if he should consider how the letter could help <mark>Trump</mark>. \"I paused, and then I said,\" Thank you for asking that question. That's a great question. But the answer is not for a moment because down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent force in American life. If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we're done,' \"Comey said. Stephanopoulos pressed Comey on the decision, saying,\" there's no precedent for putting out information like this at the end of a campaign. \"\"I think I did it the way that it should have been done,\" Comey said. \"I'm not certain of that. Other people might have had a different view. I pray to God no future FBI director ever has to find out .\" Watch the exclusive interview in a special edition of \"20/20\" on Sunday, April 15 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.

Then Williams pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Charles in the chest, she said. Officers found Charles, 25, lying in the street outside his home on the 700 Block of Lincoln Street in the early hours of Aug. 28. He died at the scene. Williams, 40, who lives in an apartment in the 9500 block of 19th Bay Street, is charged with second degree murder and a related gun count. Based on Johnson's testimony, District Judge Clark Daugherty determined there was enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury and on a track toward trial. Williams is the father of Johnson's child, and he'd come to her place earlier that night to visit them, she told Daugherty. While he was over there, Johnson's new boyfriend--who was not Charles--stopped by. Johnson asked her boyfriend to get his stuff and leave, telling him their relationship was over. He left but refused to take his things with him. Later, Williams confronted Johnson's boyfriend on the street about not getting his stuff. Charles came down from his front lawn to tell them to take their argument elsewhere, Johnson said. Williams put his hands in the air. He backed up a few steps and Charles advanced. Then Williams pulled his gun and shot Charles, who fell to the ground, Johnson said. Williams then pistol-whipped Charles in the face. Johnson, who said she was standing next to Williams when he shot Charles, intervened to prevent him from shooting her boyfriend, who ran away. \"Get...off me!\" Williams told her before fleeing, Johnson said. Johnson said Williams didn't know any of the men who were out there, including Charles. Charles died from the gunshot, which hit him in the center chest, medical examiner Wendy Gunther said in her autopsy report. The bullet hit him in the heart, right lung and spine before coming out of his back. The blow above his left eyebrow broke his eye socket and cut a 1-inch gash in his head that went to the bone, Gunther said. Defense attorney <mark>Robert Smith</mark> III asked Johnson if Charles, her boyfriend or their friends jumped at or in any way hit Williams. \"They didn't put a hand on him,\" she said. <mark>Jonathan Edwards</mark>, 757-598-3453, jonathan.edwards @ pilotonline.com"}, {"articleID": "2011012203_00211234_W", "names": {"Edwin Edwards": ["Q18160058", "Q737491"]}, "date": "2011-01-22", "url": "http://bayoubuzz.com/sports-nba/154867-nets-match-win-total-from-last-season-(ap).html", "content": "(notes) scored all of the points during a key second-half run in his first game since mid-december to lead the detroit pistons on friday night. the victory was the nets' 12th, tying the total they had last season (12-70) when they were the nba's worst team.

america's excessive consumption and borrowing, facilitated by china's aggressive export strategy and purchases of us debt - are seen by many as a major cause of the boom and subsequent bust in the global economy. obama's nine-day tour includes a stop in singapore for the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit, followed by visits to shanghai, beijing and seoul. obama said he would talk to the chinese about revaluing their currency, the yuan, as well as encouraging chinese consumers to spend more and opening chinese markets further to us goods. with the u.s. unemployment rate now at 10.2 percent, the obama administration hopes an emphasis on building export opportunities will play well at home. giving obama a possible boost ahead of the trip, china signalled on wednesday it might allow appreciation of the yuan, saying it would consider major currencies - not just the dollar - in guiding the exchange rate. soaring us budget deficits have weakened the dollar because of us borrowing to meet the day-to-day spending needs of the united states. the dollar has declined against a basket of major currencies since mid-february. us manufacturers have long complained that beijing artificially holds down the yuan's value to make chinese exports cheaper and us goods more costly for china. but obama may face some pushback from china and other countries who worry that washington's drive for economic cooperation with asia may be too one-sided. ad feedback beijing is upset over us moves to slap tariffs on chinese tires and steel pipes, while south korea and other countries harbour doubts over whether obama, elected with strong labour union support, is committed enough to a free-trade agenda. the asia tour also comes as obama juggles many pressing domestic issues, including his drive to pass healthcare reform and climate change legislation, and nears the final stages of a decision on whether to send more us troops in afghanistan. seeking deeper ties one of obama's main messages will be a promise to put a high priority on engagement with the dynamic asia-pacific region, an area of the world where he has personal connections, having grown up in hawaii and indonesia. \"the president is the first president of the united states really with an asia-pacific orientation,\" said <mark>ben rhodes</mark>, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. \"he understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world .\" forging an effective working relationship with beijing will be crucial to any effort to deepen us engagement in asia. \"i certainly think this administration differs from its predecessors in its apparent recognition of the ascendancy of china and the ascendancy of asia,\" said david rothkopf, a business consultant and former us official. the obama administration's approach towards china, known as \"strategic reassurance,\" builds on a bush administration effort to ease mistrust between washington and beijing and encourage china to become a responsible stakeholder in global affairs. obama has been accused by some critics of giving short shrift to human rights issues but he said he would bring up the subject in his meetings in china. underscoring the importance placed on the three-day china visit, obama's itinerary includes a formal state dinner, a series of meetings with president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao and a dialogue in shanghai with chinese youth. japan will be another crucial leg of obama's trip. some in tokyo and in washington worry about a drift in relations between the two staunch allies. prime minister yukio hatoyama campaigned on a pledge to set a more independent course from washington and frictions have arisen over plans to relocate the us military base on japan's okinawa island. many japanese also wonder whether historic rival china's growing economic and military clout will affect relations between washington and tokyo, which mark the 50th anniversary of their security alliance next year."}, {"articleID": "2018050209_00035076_W", "names": {"Frank Warren": ["Q1444412", "Q23657144", "Q5490233"], "Magic Man": ["Q23928996", "Q2654402"]}, "date": "2018-05-02", "url": "https://www.boxingscene.com/warren-wilder-joshua-beat-tyson-fury-true-champ--127759", "content": "Read More By: Boxing Clever <mark>Warren</mark>: Wilder, Joshua Must Beat Tyson Fury To Be \"True Champ' The efforts of Anthony Joshua (21-0, 20 KOs) and Deontay Wilder (40-0, 39 KOs) to unify the heavyweight division are in vain until they defeat lineal champion Tyson Fury, according to promoter <mark>Frank Warren</mark>.

Listen to qualifying on 5 Live Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website from 18:15 GMT on Saturday Sebastian Vettel led Charles Leclerc to a Ferrari one-two in an incident-packed second practice session at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The German was 0.021 seconds ahead of Leclerc with Red Bull's <mark>Max Verstappen</mark> third, ahead of Mercedes drivers Valtteri Bottas and <mark>Lewis Hamilton</mark>. Williams driver Robert Kubica began the session with a heavy crash at Turn Three from which he emerged unscathed. Both Toro Rossos suffered reliability problems, stopping on track. The session ran in cloudy but grey conditions after the wet weather for the morning session, but Kubica appeared to be caught out by dampness on a painted white line when he spun at the fast Turn Three on his first flying lap of the day. Brazilian Grand Prix first and second practice results <mark>Hamilton</mark> to negotiate new F1 contract Albon named Red Bull second driver for 2020 View more on twitter The Pole, whose Williams had been used by reserve driver Nicholas Latifi in the first session, lost the rear, over-corrected and spun into the wall, badly damaging three corners of the car. It was another blow for Williams, who have been struggling for pace all year and in recent races have been suffering from a shortage of spare parts. At the front, the true competitive order is hard to read, as both Ferrari drivers and <mark>Hamilton</mark> had messy runs. Vettel and <mark>Hamilton</mark> were both blocked by Bottas on their fastest laps, the world champion on the exit of Mergulho, the penultimate corner, and Vettel shortly afterwards on the exit of Juncao, just a few metres further on. And Leclerc did not improve in the final sector of his fastest lap, which suggests he, too, had more time in him. <mark>Verstappen</mark> impressed to be just 0.134 secs off the pace as Red Bull's revival in the last few races continues, and Bottas was 0.156 secs behind Vettel. The compromised <mark>Hamilton</mark> - whose time, like Vettel's, was set on his second lap on his tyres - was 0.067 secs behind his team-mate. Media playback is not supported on this device Jack Nicholls: \"Why <mark>Hamilton</mark> is better than Senna & Schumacher' Ferrari may well see the results of the session as vindication after what they consider to be unfounded allegations about their engine in the wake of two rule clarifications from governing body the FIA. Ferrari insist neither ruling - one governing the operation of the hybrid system and fuel-flow meter, and the other the addition of oil into the combustion chamber - have any effect on the running of their engine. They said they would be back to their normal form in Brazil after a disappointing race in the US last time out, and at least on Friday they look to be favourites for pole position on Saturday. Best of the rest was Kevin Magnussen's Haas, for once not struggling with tyre temperature in a disappointing season for the American team, followed by the Renault of Daniel Ricciardo and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen. The second Red Bull driver Alexander Albon, confirmed with the team for 2020 earlier this week, was struggling after a crash at the end of the first session and down in ninth place, 0.9 secs off team-mate <mark>Verstappen</mark>. At Toro Rosso, Pierre Gasly's engine failed mid-way through the session forcing the Frenchman to park up at Turn Three, while Daniil Kvyat went off at Juncao, the final corner, with five minutes to go, after his car switched off, causing him to spin lightly into the barrier, bringing out the red flag and the session to a premature end. The team said they did not yet know the cause of the problem. McLaren's Lando Norris was down in 18th place, eight places behind team-mate <mark>Carlos Sainz</mark>, but the 20-year-old Briton said he made a series of mistakes .\" I'm confident if I put the lap together and don't make the mistakes I did today, it will look a bit better, \"Norris said .\" It was actually a relatively good day, \"said <mark>Hamilton</mark>.\" The second session was good, nice and smooth.

Magistrates said imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence, criticising the men's actions as selfish and irresponsible, and adding that they could have undermined the government's anti-contagion efforts and endangered the community. As of Monday morning, Hong Kong had recorded 641 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with four related deaths. All arrivals to the city have been required to undergo compulsory quarantine for 14 days, following government measures introduced on February 8. It is a criminal offence to contravene the order and offenders are subject to a maximum fine of HK $25,000 (S $4,600) and six months' imprisonment. Fanling Court heard delivery man Sing Kin Kung-kai was required to enter a 14-day quarantine upon his return from mainland China on March 8. But when the 31-year-old local resident passed through Shenzhen Bay port that night, he lied to a health officer that he was living at a youth hostel in Yuen Long, to avoid being sent to a quarantine centre. He was intercepted at the same border control point two days later, when he tried to leave for the mainland to visit relatives. He was subsequently sent to quarantine at Tso Kung Tam Outdoor Recreation Centre in Tsuen Wan, and was charged two weeks later. He pleaded not guilty to giving false information to an authorised officer when he first appeared at West Kowloon Court on March 23, but opted to plead guilty to the charge on Monday. [[nid:481121]] The defendant told acting principal magistrate Don So Man-lung he had been without a fixed place of residence since December 2018. He pleaded for leniency on the grounds that he had tested negative for the coronavirus, and had been asymptomatic before and after the offence. But So considered immediate imprisonment the only appropriate sentence, blasting the defendant for his \"selfish\" act. \"Although the defendant might not be a carrier of the virus, its ability to incubate means that nobody can assume they are off the hook,\" the magistrate said. \"The defendant put the society in danger and had all along no intention to co-operate with the quarantine requirement. His selfish act might have dealt a blow to the government's anti-contagion efforts and put them to complete waste .\" Meanwhile at West Kowloon Court, Xie Xong-yue and <mark>Wong</mark> Yee-keung each pleaded guilty to one summons over contravention to restrictions during quarantine, for leaving their isolation site without reasonable excuse or permission. The court heard Xie, 37, was issued a 14-day quarantine order following his entry at Shenzhen Bay Control Point on February 8, running to February 21. He was required to stay at his reported address in Tsuen Wan and banned from leaving Hong Kong. [[nid:481993]] But immigration officers found him at the same port just four days later on February 12 and intercepted him. \"I wanted to see my sick mother,\" he told Principal Magistrate Peter Law Tak-chuen. <mark>Wong</mark> was similarly accused of breaching his quarantine order, effective from February 10 to 23, after he was intercepted at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge on February 13. Upon arrest, <mark>Wong</mark> told police officers that he wanted to visit the mainland for fun because he was bored at home. Both men, of prior clear records, were subsequently sent to quarantine camps to complete their isolation periods. Law said health workers were working very hard to contain the outbreak and keep everyone healthy, but the public's co-operation is needed to fight the outbreak. \"This is very irresponsible behaviour,\" he said of the offence. The magistrate also described <mark>Wong</mark>'s conduct as \"selfish to the extreme\". Xie and <mark>Wong</mark> were respectively jailed for 15 days and nine weeks as starting point of sentence, before they were given a one-third discount to credit their guilty pleas.
