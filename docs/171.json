hight's quarterbacks for that winning season were dallas cowboys' <mark>danny white</mark> and philadelphia eagles' ron jaworski, with the legendary walter payton of the chicago bears as his starting running back. clearly, the tfl has been around long before the popularity of fantasy football exploded. tyler's reggie howell believes it's the oldest fantasy football league in the state and one of the oldest in the nation. \"thirty-three years is a longtime,\" said howell, who created tfl in 1980. \"i do know of a league in california that is celebrating its 50th year this year, and it was started by a couple of guys who were actually part owners of the oakland raiders. ron wolf, who went on to be general manager of the green bay packers, used to play in that thing .\" the 33rd draft of the tfl was a few hours before kickoff of the dallas cowboys-new york giants game on wednesday. the league has always been composed of seven teams. the owners are all area residents: glenn smith, kirk brookshire, les loggins, howell, kearby herrington, <mark>bill adams</mark> and doug danley. howell had the first pick wednesday and took arian foster, houston texans running back. thirty-three years ago, the first player drafted was a dynamic running back named earl campbell. \"i really don't know what triggered it, but i remember watching a preseason game (in 1980) and saying,\" wouldn't it be fun if we could get points for what they do,' \"said howell, vice president of business development for karis resources in tyler .\" so i wrote up some rules, and amazingly they are pretty similar to today. \"howell moved to tyler a couple years later and continued the tfl in his new home with a few new owners. one of those was longtime friend and college golf teammate glenn smith. smith said he was apprehensive when howell approached him, but agreed to give it a try .\" he came to me and said, \"you're going to love this,'\" said smith, who owns glenn a. smith homes, a home-building company in tyler. smith said fantasy football in those early decades was not a regular part of the sports landscape like it is today. friends and relatives did not understand. there were questions: why are you so intense now on sundays? the cowboys won, so why are you so unhappy? or the ultimate, the cowboys just lost, why are you smiling? \"i was watching a cowboys game, and the philadelphia eagles scored, and i yelled,\" yeah!' smith recalled. \"i got the dirtiest looks from my family that you've ever seen .\" howell had a weekly ritual monday to take his usa today paper and scour it for stats on sunday's nfl games. and he wasn't the only one. every owner admitted to spending many hours amassing as much statistical information as possible about their players. \"people didn't understand what we were doing,\" said loggins, who has played in the league since 1983. \"the thing that is interesting is i am kind of a college football person. i was a cowboys fan, but i got involved with this, and it got me starting to watch (pro football).\" we started out having to dig out our stats in newspapers, and usa today was our newspaper of choice, and sometimes they'd get the stats wrong. \"football viewers today can see statistics scrolling by on their television screens during games. but loggins remembers a time when the only televised games seen sundays were ones shown on cbs or nbc, and the only way to get up-to-date stats was to watch the games and keep the stats yourself .\" that is the stuff that people can't appreciate, \"loggins said .\" you'd have a piece of paper, and you were watching one game and trying to keep up with how your player was doing. \"smith said the league improved dramatically thanks to espn premiering\" primetime \"in 1987. a highlight show hosted by sportscaster chris berman,\" primetime \"showed every game's scoring plays and other big plays. that allowed tfl owners to not have to wait on the newspaper the next day to get statistics .\" that was such a big deal, \"smith said. player transactions, such as trades or scooping up unrostered players, now can be done with a mouse click, but in those days, it was a race to see who could dial their telephone the quickest and tell the league commissioner about a player pickup. anyone with a rotary phone was in trouble .\" you'd be watching the game and see a running back for the cowboys go down with (an injury), \"loggins said .\" everybody would pick up the phone and try to call in and the first one who got through to (howell) would be able to pick up the backup. \"there was an opening in the tfl 13 years ago with an owner pulling out, and herrington (who was first on the waiting list), jumped at the opportunity .\" i thought it was crazy when i first heard about it, but then i wanted in, \"said herrington, a representative from feliciano financial group in tyler. while many leagues do head-to-head matchups each week, tfl pits all seven team's scores each week and puts them against one another. for instance, if howell's team scored 130 points, and that ranked second overall, he would be 5-1 that week, with the team ahead of him going 6-0. the league continues this way through the playoffs until the winner is the team with the best record at the close of the season .\" part of our strategy, even in our draft, is to try and prognosticate the playoffs and pick players who will be on those teams, \"herrington said. the positive with this type of scoring is in tfl, unlike the nfl, the best team throughout the entire season is the winning team. howell and smith have their names engraved on the tfl trophy the most .\" people have left and come back after playing other leagues, and everybody has always told me that this is the best league they've played in, \"howell said. memories in the 1987 afc championship game, a fumble by cleveland browns running back ernest byner has forever haunted their memory and added more mystique to the winning team, which had denver quarterback john elway. but that fumble also created havoc in the tfl final standings .\" that night we went to sleep thinking that one guy had won the championship and we didn't realize that ernest byner, on that play, had given his owner 100 yards and that boosted up his score enough to finish first, \"howell said .\" so when we woke up the next morning and looked at the stats, everything changed. \"the other owners admitted that smith takes the league much more seriously than the rest of them, to the point that he\" crawls into a dark room and you won't see him for months (when his team struggles), \"loggins said in jest. that obsession is shown in a letter smith still has that was sent from <mark>joe gibbs</mark> after smith wrote the former washington redskins coach and asked why he was not playing running back ricky ervins more .\" i am not any more obsessed than the rest of them, but yeah, i did that, \"smith admitted .\" ervins had been giving the redskins some huge games, but then all of a sudden, (<mark>gibbs</mark>) wouldn't play him. i copied some clippings of his stats from a couple games and highlighted him. i lied and said in the letter that i was a huge washington redskins fan, and i've got these stats and just wonder why you are not playing him more. \"well, he sent a letter back that said i really appreciate you being a fan of the redskins and i will give consideration to what you said; signed, <mark>joe gibbs</mark>.\" smith said the letter had no effect on ervins' playing time the rest of the season. in another year, howell completed a trade with an owner who was a lawyer and that player tore his acl the next week. \"one day i was at the office, and a sheriff's deputy was there and he handed me a summons,\" howell said. \"i look at it and i am being sued in the universal court of man for damages because i knew about <mark>stump mitchell</mark> before i traded him. it was a well-written two-page document .\" howell said the reasons he formed the league three decades ago are the same: everyone still enjoys it today.", "articleID": "2012091019_00056757_W", "names": {"Danny White": ["Q16983371", "Q4111239"], "Joe

tuesday, september 11, 2012 tim flanders rushed for 117 yards, breaking the shsu record for rushing yards as only a junior. bearkat running back tim flanders captured the all-time career rushing record for <mark>sam houston</mark> state university in saturday's landslide 54-7 victory against the university of incarnate word. \"i [told] all my offensive linemen\" thank you, \"i told [brian] bell\" thank you,' i told most of the receivers that i had a chance to see, \"said flanders .\" i'm blessed to have broken the record. i wanted to do it at flanders' touchdowns both came in the first quarter with a 40-yard run 45 seconds into the game and an eight yard run towards the end of the quarter. this was the running back's 16th career game with 100 plus yards, having 117 yards during the game. fieilo was carted off the field in a stretcher after sustaining an injury making a hard tackle on an incarnate word player. \"he went down with his head down,\" senior linebacker darius taylor said. \"i knew it was bad when he didn't move. eric is one of our toughest players. we just said a little prayer for him and wished him the best and now he's alright, he's been fieilo will move back to the starting lineup. sophomore back-up running back keshawn hill rotated with flanders throughout the game and showed his speed with two break-away touchdowns in the second half. hill is a heck of a back,\" head coach willie fritz said. \"sometimes having tim [flanders] back there some of the other running backs get overlooked. we got to do a good job calling plays for each of the defense, led by taylor, held the cardinals to a mere 88 yards compared to bearkat defense expected incarnate word to run the ball frequently after watching their videos against texas college the previous week .\" they couldn't run the ball, \"taylor said .\" they tried to do it early and that's what they tried to do last week [against texas college] as well. so coming into the game we knew we had to stop the run and i felt like we did had a slow start in the first quarter with a fumble on incarnate word's first punt on their opening drive. the cardinals quickly recovered the ball at their own 41-yard line. \"i thought we had a bunch of first game jitters,\" fritz said. \"we weren't very sharp and crisp. i think we calmed down a little bit [after the first half .]\" bearkats did a good job playing against incarnate word's special team formations and adjusting to their versatile punt strategy. \"they changed things up [with their punt formations],\" fritz said. \"they punted with a different guy? we had it played pretty early in the fourth quarter, senior wide receiver terrance robinson returned a punt for a 60-yard touchdown to seal the game as a to prepare for the game against baylor this saturday, coach fritz is expecting a week of corrections on both sides of the ball to be ready for the big 12 baylor bears .\" [we have] a lot of good things to correct on tape, \"fritz said .\" there are guys that earned more playing time; there are guys that earned less playing time. teams make their greatest improvements between week one and week in preparation for the baylor game this saturday, taylor is expecting a different outcome with the veteran bearkat squad compared to 2010's 3-34 loss against the bears. \"it's a big game for us. we were a young team [in 2010] and i think

"content": "frank beamer might have had doubts as to whether <mark>bruce taylor</mark> would be ready to play saturday against pittsburgh, but the senior linebacker was unequivocal about it. \"it's doing good,\" he said of his sprained ankle. \"yes, i will be playing .\" <mark>taylor</mark> dressed but was kept out of the austin peay game as a precautionary measure after spraining his against georgia tech last monday even though he wanted to play against the governors. instead, he stood on the sideline, donning a baseball cap with his helmet nowhere in sight. he was in a blue, limited contact jersey monday but defensive coordinator bud foste r said he was moving around well. fellow inside linebacker tariq edwards, meanwhile, continues to be in blue because of his knee. he was favoring his leg noticeably at the end of practice and, from all indications, will likely not make his season debut this weekend. \"tariq, there will be some things that he'll have to go through, do some contact, do some things and get his timing back,\" foster said. \"but i know that he's a guy that i trust. but we've got to see if he can go and do it too. i'll be anxious to see if he can go do it. he looks better and better and i think mentally he feels better and better and i think that's a big part when you have those type of injuries .\" receiver d.j. coles was also a surprise player in blue monday, although beamer said on tech talk live that he's still out for the season because of a knee injury. the coach wants to keep him around football for the time being. facebook. here are some more notes and quotes from monday interviews? i did not see center <mark>andrew miller</mark> out at practice near the end monday, although there were a lot of guys and it was difficult to spot them with their jerseys off. he appeared to leave saturday's game early with an ankle injury. defensive end <mark>james gayle</mark> had a wrap on his shoulder, something he hurt after one play against austin peay when he hit the quarterback, but he should be fine. foster likened playing pittsburgh to \"playing a wounded animal. they're going to be backed up in a corner .\" he said despite what the first two games have shown that the panthers still are a physical group with a dynamic tailback (ray graham). \"they're playing a quality opponent in us and they're going to play their tail off,\" he said. \"we expect that .\" foster said the hokies have looked at lot of wisconsin film to see what first-year pittsburgh head coach paul chryst will do saturday. chryst was the badgers' offensive coordinator for seven years before going to pittsburgh and taking much of his offensive staff with him. \"they're doing the same the same stuff,\" foster said. \"the coordinator, they've got another guy calling plays, but one of his guys. they're running the same routes, the same offense, they're doing with pitt that they were doing with wisconsin. but you know, it takes baby steps. they've been there 15 days of spring and a month and a half [this season]. i'm sure they want to build a foundation to the program. it looks like they're working that way. foster noted a few backups that had solid games against austin peay in what was really their first extended action: de dadi nicolas, cb donaldven manning, s <mark>michael cole</mark>, lb deon clarke and lb chase williams .\" you've got some guys who took a step right there, \"he said .\" and we may need them down the road. \"plenty of stuff on rover kyshoen jarrett tonight. i plan on writing something on him for wednesday's paper. here's what secondary coach torrian gray had to say about him:\" just from a physicality standpoint, when the lights went on, i wasn't sure if i was going to get the kind of player we've seen these first two games. after that first game and he came up with the physicality that he came with, it gave him confidence. \"(jarrett, by the way, is a pennsylvania native who was a former pittsburgh commitment until dave wannstedt got run a few years ago .) as for cb antone exum, gray thought he wasn't as sharp in the second game .\" first game he was great, \"gray said .\" second game he was very inconsistent. \"gray said exum's technique needs to be cleaned up, things like lining up with the right leverage .\" as good of an athlete that he is, there's still some things that you've got to go through that, ok, ok, and he's just going through that, \"gray said .\" it's still a new position for him, so he'll be fine. \"exum said he owed safety detrick bonner some gratitude for breaking up a long pass after an austin peay receiver got by him on a double move. bonner came over the top and leveled the receiver, jarring the ball loose for an incompletion .\" i thanked him right on the field when it happened, \"exum said .\" i don't know if y' all saw it. we were celebrating right on the field because if it wasn't for him? we game-planned on them running that throw, so i was going to jump it. any sign of him stopping, i was going to go jump it and try to make a play. when he did that and took off? we hadn't seen a double move all week on film from those guys, so i'm just glad he was able to come over and make a tremendous play. \"exum brought back the blond mohawk (or the simon phoenix look from\" <mark>demolition man</mark> \") because he felt like it was kind of his trademark .\" i had to get back, \"he said .\" i played well with it last year when i had it, so i had to get it back. \"he said his teammates don't give him as hard of a time about it as they did last year .\" they kind of went away from the jokes this year because i wore them out, \"he said .\" it's fun. \"linebacker jack tyler proudly sported a washington redskins t-shirt today after watching rookie quarterback robert griffin iii lead them to a season-opening win against new orleans on sunday .\" i actually just bought my super bowl tickets yesterday after the win, \"he joked .\" so i'll be there in february. \"tyler likes what he sees out of rgiii .\" it's fun to watch him, \"he said .\" he just looks like he's having fun out there. back when we had <mark>jason campbell</mark> and those guys, i always thought they were having a terrible time out there. he looks like he's having fun. every throw that he made yesterday, i was energetic about it and i thought that a big play was about to happen. that's something you don't get out of a lot of quarterbacks. \"apparently that wasn't the case with rex grossman .\" rex grossman is not my guy, \"tyler said with a laugh .\" something about him just never really appealed to me. \"tyler is apparently a nice guy on the field. too nice, according to <mark>taylor</mark>. tyler helped give a lost shoe back to an austin peay player during saturday's game .\" i just remember making the tackle and i feel like i missed the tackle and i came back and i just had his shoe in my arms, \"he said .\" what's the point in just throwing it? i just thought i'd give it back to him. i thought i'd be a nice guy about it. it's football. i like to have fun. i'm not one of those guys who is nuts and crazy on the field and is always screaming and yelling. i have my moments where i get energetic after a big play and like to show emotion, but for the most part i'm really relaxed out there. \"<mark>taylor</mark> gave him a hard time about it .\" apparently that's how you play good defense is you throw shoes at people, \"tyler said .\" i just thought i'd be a good samaritan and help him out. \"hokies kicker cody journell, two others arrested,
