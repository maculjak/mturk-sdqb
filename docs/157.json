manny pacquiao's vocal opposition to same-sex marriage wednesday, as the filipino superstar tried to quiet the storm. more coverage for more boxing news and analysis, check out the boxing tribune. pacquiao sparked a flurry of headlines in an interview earlier this week by disagreeing with president barack obama's view that gay couples should be allowed to marry--calling it a direct attack on the morals of society and the will of god. the devout christian said wednesday he is not against homosexuality, just same-sex marriage. \"i'm not against gay people,\" pacquiao said in a statement. \"i have a relative who is also gay. we can't help it if they were born that way. what i'm critical of are actions that violate the word of god. i only gave out my opinion that same-sex marriage is against the law of god .\" however his clarification was not enough to stop to another online confrontation with mayweather. fans of the sport have long called for the pair to match up against each other in the ring--but neither camp has agreed to the other's demands thus far, and the pair do most of their fighting through the media. mayweather tweeted wednesday evening, \"i stand behind president obama & support gay marriage. i'm an american citizen & i believe people should live their life the way they want .\" in his statement earlier in the day, pacquiao, who is training for a june 9 fight against undefeated american timothy bradley, also maintained he never made a reference to the bible's book of leviticus when interviewed. the writer who conducted the interview for examiner.com included the passage from leviticus stating, \"if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads .\" pacquiao, who is a lawmaker in his native philippines, said, \"i didn't say that, that's a lie...i didn't know that quote from leviticus because i haven't read the book of leviticus yet .\" the writer, granville ampong, has since said pacquiao never referenced the passage, although his article suggested the boxer had agreed with it. amidst the fallout from the interview, a popular los angeles entertainment complex nixed an interview between the boxer and <mark>mario lopez</mark> of \"extra,\" according to kcbs-tv. boxing's first-ever eight-division champion was slated to appear at the grove wednesday afternoon, and both men had tweeted invitations for fans to watch the filming. the grove, which is owned by prominent los angeles developer rick caruso, cited the 33-year-old boxer's \"intolerance\" in its decision to cancel the taping. \"based on news reports of statements made by mr. pacquiao we have made it be known that he is not welcome at the grove and will not be interviewed here now or in the future,\" read a statement from grove vice president of corporate affairs bill reich. posted: may 13, 2012 american <mark>michael hunter</mark>

"content": "la police arrest 2 in killings of chinese students associated press los angeles (ap) - police arrested two young men in the shootings deaths of two graduate students from china last month near the university of southern california, an attack that stunned a school that has more international students than any other u.s. university. javier bolden, 19, and bryan barnes, 20, were arrested friday on suspicion of killing the two during an apparent robbery attempt, los angeles police chief charlie beck said. ming qu, of jilin, and <mark>ying wu</mark>, of hunan, were shot april 11 while sitting in a bmw about a mile away from the usc campus. both were 23 years old. their parents filed a lawsuit this week accusing usc of misrepresenting safety at the campus, where nearly one-fifth of the 38,000 students are from overseas, including 2,500 from china. the motive for their killings was still under investigation, beck said, but the \"evidence points to a street robbery,\" and investigators believe the killings were part of a larger string of crimes the two men committed in los angeles. \"forensic evidence recovered at the scene linked them to two other attempted homicides,\" beck said at a news conference. evidence directly linked both suspects to the victims, he added. beck said neither suspect had a long criminal history or is a documented gang member, though police suspect they may have a gang affiliation. mayor antonio villaraigosa congratulated the city's police force, which cooperated with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives to investigate the killings and make the arrests friday. he praised officers for \"diligence in following every lead and investigating every detail .\" beck declined to provide details of how the suspects were pinpointed but said, \"this was a crime that shocked this city, and we absolutely left no stone unturned .\" barnes was arrested at a home about five miles from campus friday afternoon, and bolden was arrested a few hours later in palmdale, beck said. both were being held without bail and are set to be arraigned tuesday. the campus is located in an urban center a few miles south of downtown. it is across the street from county museums and not far from the staples center arena and a gentrifying area of victorian homes. yet it is also known as an area that had faced high crime and gang activity. in their lawsuit, the victims' parents alleged that the school made false claims about safety in the \"frequently asked questions\" section of its online application. the 15-page lawsuit accuses usc of hiding behind the word \"urban\" and not saying the school is in a high-crime residential area. it also notes that chinese students in particular would interpret urban to mean usc is in a safe area. \"the\" urban' representation misled chinese students, including ming qu, into believing the area is safe since in china, the more urban the area, the safer the area, \"the lawsuit states, claiming usc understood this is how chinese students would interpret the description. usc lawyer debra wong yang said the university was deeply saddened by the deaths but found the lawsuit to be baseless. <mark>zhou rong</mark>, a beijing-based education consultant who advises chinese students wishing to study overseas, said the word\" urban \"to people in china has no connotation of safety .\" i think it only means the location and has nothing to do with safety and crime, \"said <mark>zhou</mark>, who works for new oriental vision overseas consulting. the school and city police announced new security measures after the slayings and promised more video cameras, escorts and patrols. the additional security will include sending over 30 more officers to the department division that handles the usc area, and the university will pay for four additional officers to patrol the student residential neighborhoods, beck said. in a statement friday, usc president c.l. max nikias praised law enforcement and city officials .\" the arrest of the suspects in the tragic deaths of our graduate students, <mark>ying wu</mark> and ming qu, begins the process of healing and of closing a painful chapter in the life of our community, \"nikias said. _______ associated press researcher henry hou in beijing contributed to this report abc12 main station 810-233-3130",
