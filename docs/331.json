Related Stories Burlington builder's \"modernistic'...Adi Development Group is seeking to amend the city's official plan and zoning bylaw for a residential high-density site at 4853 Thomas Alton Blvd., just off Appleby Line. A statutory public meeting was held at city hall last week where staff presented an information report on the application. Those from the affected Ward 6 neighbourhood, as well as Adi's solicitor Denise Baker of Weir Folds LLP, delegated the community and corporate services committee .' I think we need to look at this with open eyes and consider the fact that we do have people who are aging in place, and we do have needs for affordable housing, and there may be opportunities for transit' Ward 6 Councillor Blair Lancaster\" They (the builder) need to take into consideration our concerns around parking, concerns around schooling and concerns around safety when it comes down to (emergency) evacuations, \"said resident Dhruv Koch .\" We understand that there needs to be development, and development is good, but what we do not understand is why is there a need for high density and creating these buildings out in our Alton village. \"Much like Adi's proposal to build a 26-storey tower at 374 Martha Street, plans for two 19-storey condominiums, 498 units in total, on Thomas Alton is nearly double the maximum permitted building height of 10 storeys. The 4.96-acre property purchased from Emery Homes also includes 160 stacked townhouse units, 21 stacked towns and 12 back-to-backs. Adi is seeking amendments to allow an overall density on the site of 344 units per hectare, among other site-specific changes. Maximum residential density is set currently at 185 units per hectare. Mayor Rick Goldring asked Baker what community residents stand to gain from a development being built with this proposed density .\" The benefits to the community, to the city, are of course intensification, which is a provincial objective, \"she said .\" There are benefits...in terms of compatibility as it abuts the adjacent properties to the east. \"Similarly in tone, several councillors questioned if Adi would work to address some of the concerns raised regarding traffic. Baker said only preliminarily comments had been received from the city's planning staff but that her client was open to working with the city .\" The planning process is always an iterative process, \"Baker said .\" We have those discussions in consultation with planning staff, and planning staff as well as my client take into consideration all of the comments of the community. \"Adi's application was sent to the city on Oct. 21, 2015, and about 40 residents attended a neighbourhood meeting at Corpus Christi Secondary School in early December. Many of the same people were at city hall to plead their case to city councillors. Ward 6 Councillor Blair Lancaster said in her view it is clear the proposal is\" overdeveloped \"but that any solution must also consider the fact that the demographics in Alton are changing .\" I think we need to look at this with open eyes and consider the fact that we do have people who are aging in place, and we do have needs for affordable housing, and there may be opportunities for transit, \"Lancaster said .\" We have to find a way to make this work for the community. \"Part of the proposal is predicated on the zoning bylaw amendment to allow road access off Thomas Alton Boulevard and Palladium Way. Alton resident, and local real estate agent, Andrea Florian said she was already concerned about traffic safety issues in her community that aren't being addressed .\" Palladium Way's a racetrack right now, \"she said, questioning the two access points to the proposed development .\" It's extremely dangerous and I'm surprised more cops haven't advantage of the drag racing that goes on there on the weekends. \"City staff had already raised concerns about a traffic study that was completed at off-peak times during March Break as well as last summer. Baker noted her client had already made adjustments to parking allotments in response conversations with city planners and the community .\" A number of concerns were raised with respect to the traffic study in terms of the parking counts that were done, \"Baker said .\" That has been revised to include additional parking counts and a copy of that study has been or is about to be resubmitted to the (city) for their consideration...\"According to the previously submitted traffic study, consultants for Adi accounted for a 15 per cent reduction in trip generation to account for\" non-auto oriented trips. \"Burlington Transit also operates Route 15 in the area, and Adi has told the Post it is considering a car-share program on site .\" We wouldn't be able to put in a proposal for this density if it wasn't able to be justified by traffic studies without appropriate mitigation, \"Baker said. Commercial amenities, such as grocery stores, shopping and restaurants are still a world away across a busy Appleby Line .\" We have to get into our car to access any kind of shopping, any kind of amenity, \"Florian said .\" We can't even buy a bag of milk without having to get into our car right now. \"It also remains to be seen what solutions could be found for accommodating more families in the local public and Catholic schools. Burlington's director of planning and building, Mary Lou Tanner, said there is a balance to be struck between enrolment projections and new developments .\" I think the dynamic we're seeing in Alton is there's multiple families living in some of the homes, \"she said .\" We want to be mindful that as children age, we want to have a sustained population base so the school does remain open and active. \"Tanner said there is value in having a mix of housing in a neighbourhood, and not everyone can afford a single-detached home .\" We want to be able to provide that range of housing. It is an important point because there are so few apartment buildings, and apartment sites in Alton, \"she said .\" I think it's also important to remember as family members age that we want them to age in neighbourhood. We don't want people having to move to other parts of any city, or this city, just because they can't find their chosen housing type. \"The question is size, scale, massing and quality of design and that's what we're going to focus on because when we get that right we can manage the traffic .\" <mark>Michael Gregory</mark> is a reporter with the Burlington Post.

We were running through a town trying to take cover. I was a Poru\u010dnik in the VRS can't say I was proud to fight under Mladi\u0107 nor can I say I was proud to have fought in the war.

In the distance we then seen a church and graveyard were we would take cover from the artillery. Chapter 1 Edit We began to rest as we were out of aim of the artillery. \"That's our own damn artillery bombing us\" shouted McCourt as he lay down to take a drink of water. \"What are you reading Jackie?\" Babi\u0107 asked Zhang who before answering glanced then said \"It's a World War 2 memorial\". Stojanovi\u0107 then turned to Zhang and said \"Hej Valter what is wrong with your eyes?\" then Zhang answered \"Nothing why?\" and Radi\u0107 said to Stojanovi\u0107 \"Chinese naturally have eyes like that\" then Babi\u0107 continued \"Yeah Draza unlike your family the Chinese don't get their eyes through incest like how your cousin got his\". We all laughed but Vuk got up and was about to hit Babi\u0107 but I threatened him by telling him he \"would be shot if he didn't calm himself\". Boris then went over to me and asked \"Hej <mark>Milan</mark> do you remember that summer when we went to the Montenegrin coast?\" and I replied \"Summer of 87 how could either of us forget\" I remembered one particular day as it was yesterday. Me and Boris were walking down a beach trying to pick up girls like any single man would do. We walked into a bar and asked for two cokes despite Boris' best efforts to try and prove/lie we were eighteen. A pretty girl was sitting beside us. \"Hej <mark>Milan</mark>\" said Boris pointing his head towards her and I turned around \"Zdrava\" I said to her and she turned around greeted me. She smiled at me and we started talking a bit. She eventually asked me my name and I told her \"<mark>Milan Nikoli\u0107</mark>\" and I told her I was from Bosnia and where about. She never knew as it was only a small town of 4,257 people but she was from a similar sized town in Montenegro. She also told me her name \"Marija Vidi\u0107\" and asked me if we could meet later. I did and I went back the next year to find her after a whole six months of slagging from Boris between then. It would later turn out me and Marija would marry after convincing her to move to Bosnia and have two children together, Zlatan and Milena. Now however I wish I had stayed with her in Montenegro. The artillery stopped and we decided to move on towards our objective which was very unclear at this point. Chapter 2 Edit I remember first meeting my squad after leaving officer school. Valter met me as soon as I got out of the jeep. \"Everyone out of the truck\" he shouted. I remember the truck then driving off as the squad assembled and McCourt shouting after leaving his hash on the truck. I gave a sigh of relief when I seen Boris knowing I'd be with him for the war. Fast forward three months and we're all on the back of a UAZ pickup driven by McCourt with Zupan, our mechanic up beside him. Draza and Simo Radi\u0107, a school teacher from Sarajevo who strongly embraces Titoism hence his nickname were arguing as usual but Tito was always the winner. McCourt pulled over and got into the back, \"Zhang it's your turn to drive\" he said climbing in. As Zhang got out McCourt started rolling a joint. He wore a Keffiyeh around his neck and owned a Palestinian flag which he fixed onto the UAZ, it made us look more of soldiers of Yasser Arafat than of Ratko Mladi\u0107, he also wore his tank top as a bandana and wore an Irish Brigade flag armband. \"Hej Chetnik do you want some?\" he asked Draza who replied \"No I don't want to die commie\" and McCourt responded \"You don't want to smoke weed because you're afraid to die? What's with the bottles of Rakia and all the camel cigarettes?\" Draza then asked McCourt \"Hej Vladan how's your brother, blown up many Brits?\" and Boris added \"Yeah Paddy how is he?\" McCourt's brother was a member of the PIRA. I remember him telling me that his grandfather was one of the Irish Asylum Seekers during the 60's who moved to the continent to escape the conservative Catholic laws that were in place and the stoner in front of me was sure a chip off the old block. The youngest member of our squad was a Kosovo boy named Antonije Dragi\u0107 but we all called him Tony he was only seventeen during the war. His ambition was to become a runner in the Olympics and I must say he was a very fast runner. His home town was destroyed seven years ago by Albanian Islamists. He had only found out his pregnant sister and her boyfriend were killed by a suicide bombing in Banja Luka. We were driven into Boris and I's home town for a scouting mission and we disembarked the UAZ. Chapter 3 Edit We patrolled the empty the town after hearing about Islamist movement nearby. Our home town was called Vodopadi Crkvi, it had been historically a Serb town with a large Croat minority anted in the entrance corridor next to the resource room. I noticed some of the annual photos were lying on the ground I picked one up, it was from the 1981-82 school year and we had just won the Republic School Cup. I remember standing next to Gospodin Muhammadi\u0107 the fifth grade teacher with his son Ahmed as he took the photo of the team holding the trophy. I was in sixth grade at the time, just months away from starting gymnasium. Boris was the school's captain and the top scorer that semester. I went back out onto the streets and met Boris and showed him the picture \"They sure were happier times\" he said to me. I then walked into my own house. It wasn't as looted as some other homes however there was graffiti in our sitting room that read \"Srbe na Vrbe\" with an Ustasha U and crucifix above it. I found a note in a drawer in me and Marija's bedroom. It told me what had happened before she and the kids fled to Greece it read \"Dear <mark>Milan</mark>, As you know me and the kids are hopefully in Greece. What happened has been happing here has been terrible, <mark>Vladimir Vu\u010dkovi\u0107</mark> was beheaded by Arkan's Tigers, the Islamists killed the \u0110uki\u0107s across the road and Ustashas beat Dr. Izetbegovi\u0107 to a pulp .\" I went back outside and showed Boris what was happing. McCourt then asked me \"You've got kids?\" and I answered him \"Yes two, Zlatan and Milena\". Boris then asked McCourt how many he had and Valter answered it for him \"He has five don't you Paddy? One with an army nurse, one with an Argentinean peacekeeper, one with an Italian, one with an Irish and one with a Brazilin\" and McCourt then replied \"You forgot about my daughter which I had with my ex back in Bijeljina, she must be nearly six now\". I then asked Valter how many he had and he answered \"Three, two twin daughters with my ex-wife and a son with my girlfriend\". Draza walked past and Vladan asked him \"Hej Chetnik how many do you have? Fifteen all of them legally your nephews or nieces as well as your cousins\" Draza replied \"Shut up stoner, how many bastard kids you have with nurses and female peacekeepers?\" After laughing at McCourt and Draza we heard a noise. It was only us ten in Vodopadi Crkvi and we were all together. I seen someone run across the street and I ran over to the damaged Opel sedan to take cover. The figure was a Bosniak rebel and he aimed his rifle but I fired be he could shoot. I then went over to the body and found out the rebel was Ahmed Muhammadi\u0107. Chapter 4 Edit It was early in the morning just a night after we were in Vodopadi Crkvi we approached a hamlet. Three of our soldiers were about to rape a Bosniak woman but McCourt fired at them wounding them, the woman got up and ran and McCourt went over to one of the soldiers and started pissing on him. I started talking to my squad \"Okay I'm going as in ditching the army and heading to my family in Greece\" and Bobienski responded \"So you're deserting\" and I nodded to confirm this. I then continued \"Is anyone in with me? Boris?\" who nodded and said \"I suppose so\" at the same time McCourt shouted \"Refreshing isn't it?\" and came back over to the squad and asked \"What's going on?\" and I told him about my plans for desertion and he responded with I was riding up front with McCourt a few hours later. We were listing to the radio. We had just heard a speech by Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and another speech by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had just started. I shouted \"Fucking turn it off\" and Paddy did it. He then asked me \"Any requests?\" and I said \"Play the IRA song\" \"Which one?

Just as the song ended the UAZ ran out of gas. After McCourt had noticed this he sent Tony and Zupan to get some petrol. \"Paddy the nearest gas station is eight kilometres away\" Babi\u0107 said and McCourt replied \"Want some?\" handing him a bag of hash and Tito said \"Play us some music Paddy\" and McCourt played his Bob Marley tape. We sat relaxing as Three Little Birds started playing. McCourt lit a joint and Bobienski asked him \"How many of them do you smoke a day?\" and McCourt answered \"I smoke weed two or three times every day\". \"Hej commie that fucks your brain\" Draza said and McCourt retaliated \"Just for that Chetnik I'm going to play a song on my custom tape just for you\". He got into the cabin and put in a tape, he started skipping a few songs until he found the Internationale and then started singing \"Arise all victims of oppression, the fascist fears our might...\"and Draza simply got annoyed and asked him if he had any\" good \"(Chetnik) songs. After the Internationale had stopped playing Predaj se srce by Indexi started playing. Boris said with a tear in his eye\" I used to love that song \"and Valter replied\" It's my number one forever \"Draza added\" All though I hate Croats that is a good song \"and I said\" A classic of good old Titoslavia indeed \". Zupan and Tony returned with two full jerry cans of petrol and I helped McCourt fill the tank then we drove off listing to Burning Bridges. Chapter 6 Edit I remember being in Bijeljina back in 1989 with my wife and Zlatan, this was a year before Milena was born. This was the city were McCourt was from however this was before I even met him. Zlatan was about a year old and I was carrying him on my shoulders as we seen the sites. I remember pointing to a statue of Tito and telling Zlatan how he liberated us from the Nazis in the 40's, but I doubt a one year old would have understood a word of that. Flash forward six years and the town is in flames I remember sitting at the same statue I pointed at back in 89. I was taking cover from Bosniak artillery fire while being separated from my squad. I remember two members of Arkan's Tigers come up to me and asked me if I needed a lift. The car stopped and we got out. One of the men gave me a pistol and told me to execute a pregnant woman who had a potato sack over her head. I then shot the two mobsters and helped the woman. Why they wanted me to do it I'll never know however I was out of outside of the artillery fire. I heard Draza shout from a window of an apartment block and I went up. I found the entire squad around that area. Outside the building I heard McCourt singing\" Everyone's gone cleansing, cleansing Bosnia \"and writing graffiti saying\" Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1 \"and\" From Makedonia to the world \". Draza was looting and burning with a bunch of soldiers outside our squad. After rounding them all up (most of them were in the lobby) we headed towards our objective, which was an airlift out of town. When we left the building we were attacked by Islamists and we returned fire. After we defeated them McCourt said\" Hej I've got the munchies anyone fancy something, there's an Indian down the road \". Me, Boris, Babi\u0107 and Bobienski decided to eat anyway .\" Come on Jackie, it's like the stuff your grandparents make, fine it's spicy is that enough? \"and Zhang jumped on the band wagon also. It seemed like a stupid idea as it would have been likely that there would have been no service but we were lucky. We were greeted by the restaurant's owner at the door, he was a short man and looked like an Indian Tom Bosely and from what McCourt said to him at the door he was nicknamed because of that .\" How many today Paddy? \"the owner said and McCourt replied\" Five Howard \"and the owner showed us to our seats .\" Hej <mark>Milan</mark> you never told us what team you support \"I replied to him\" I support FK Sarajevo \"and the squad laughed\" Really you support them? \"Bobienski asked then I told them I support Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161 .\" Radni\u010dki? Who are their Greek friends? \"Babi\u0107 asked which I told him\" I don't follow football that much but I did play it a lot when I was younger \". The owner's daughter who served as a waitress came out and asked us what we wanted. McCourt only had eyes for her and I can say I couldn't blame him .\" I'll have the usual \"McCourt said and the waitress turned to him and said\" Paddy, Ivan said you were killed \"and McCourt replied\" Ivan's a stupid cunt and you know extremely well Kanta \". McCourt got up and they hugged each other. After we ate Kanta came over and sat on Paddy's lap .\" How much will this be? \"Valter asked her and Kanta answered\" Usually around ninety Marks or Dinar but since Paddy is here and it is war my father said you're free of charge \". Babi\u0107 then said coughing\" Thank god, I didn't want to pay for that Lav \"which Valter asked\" Why Vlado? \"and Babi\u0107 answered\" Because it burned me you Chinese bastard \"\"You deserved it then\" Valter said back. We heard a noise coming from our radio, it was Major Novak \"Poru\u010dnik <mark>Nikoli\u0107</mark>, Poru\u010dnik <mark>Nikoli\u0107</mark>, do you copy <mark>Milan</mark>\" I thought Zupan had the hand radio but I answered \"Da, kopirate\". The Major was asking where we were and that we should hurry up towards the LZ. I told the boys that we should go. Before we left Paddy gave his helmet to Kanta and told her to take care. We then headed towards landing zone. I then woke up and this being all a flashback. I heard Novak's voice and German being spoken. Chapter 7 Edit \"Kommandant Petridis, come in Petridis\" Novak said into his hand radio and Petridis responded to him \"Da major\" and Novak told him we needed a sitrep east of our current location and Petridis tried to tell him it was behind enemy lines. Paddy was responsible for the German being spoken. There were three German peacekeepers with a jeep near the gostionica we had stopped. \"Wo seid ihr alle aus?\" Paddy asked and two soldiers replied with different answers \"Ich komme aus K\u00f6ln\" said a short blonde headed man and a man of West African appearance said \"M\u00fcnchen, Johannes ist auch hier von einer Bayerischer Alpenst\" , Johannes was the taller brown haired man. \"Hey Jean-Luc gehst du mit ihm \u00fcber die Kneipe zu fragen?\" asked the shorter soldier and the Black soldier asked Paddy \"Haben du etwas dagegen, wenn wir gehen in die Kneipe?\" who's reply was \"Wir waren nur einen Zwischenstopp hier\". \"Jean-Luc, wo ist deine Familie aus?\" Paddy asked and the soldier answered \"Die Elfenbeink\u00fcste, C & ocirc; te d'Ivoire\" which Paddy replied \"Ah C & ocirc; te d'Ivoire, beste Mannschaft in Afrika. K\u00f6nnen du sprechen Franz\u00f6sisch?\" Jean-Luc kept simply agreeing with Paddy until that last question which he replied with \"Oui et vous?\" and Paddy answered him \"Oui\". I stepped outside and remembered the events in Bijeljina a couple of months ago. I then remembered opening a video shop with a friend, <mark>Vladimir Vu\u010dkovi\u0107</mark> who was supposedly killed a few months ago. It was 1988 I remember standing outside our newly opened shop, and Dance Hall Days was playing on the radio. Boris was taking our photo. \"Hej Mi\u0161o bring us back that photo okay\" <mark>Vladimir</mark> said as Boris walked away to get the photo developed. My father who was present said \"How are you going to get business here, pirate?\" and I told him \"You must be forgetting how big this AREA is\". I was awoken from my flashback by Novak who asked me if we were heading out towards Greece. Chapter 8 Edit I had told Novak about our plan to go AWOL and he agreed saying how pointless this war was. McCourt, the major and Tito were going to scout ahead on the road while the rest of us were going to scout about the fields. During this wandering we had noticed we had walked onto a minefield after one of stepped on a mine. \"X\u00ecngji\u0101o de du\u00ecxi\u00e0ng\" shouted Valter and Boris replied \"There's no need for fucking profanity Valter, who bought it?\" Tony turned his head back and shouted \"Bobienski\". I then said to the squad \"You've all seen Kelly's Heroes, you know the one which Paddy seemingly walked out of? Well do what they done when the GIs walked into the minefield\". Babi\u0107 added after my command \"<mark>Milan</mark> what about Draza he doesn't know what a TV is\" which everyone except Draza laughed at. We managed to get through the minefield and get to the UAZ which was parked nearby. I asked McCourt if he spotted anything and told me of a Croatian army movement heading our way. \"Petridis, are you there Petridis? Come on you crooked nosed mongrel answer do you copy? Petridis?\" said Novak into his hand radio. \"Halo \u010cetnici\" said a man on the radio \"We killed your Greek fucker, we slit his neck as you called him. Now we're going to do what we should have done back in\" 43 \"another man said and a group of men started singing\" Pu\u0161ka puca a top rice, grmi kao grom, Sad Usta\u0161a bojak bije za Hrvatski dom, sad Ust...\"Novak had turned off the radio\" Ustasha scum \"he then said .\" Are they the same guys behind us? \"Boris asked and Novak said\" You're half-Croat do you think you're all like that? The guys nearby are the Croatian army those knuckle draggers on the radio are just terrorists. Chapter 9 Edit \"Jebi\" shouted McCourt as the jeep stopped. It was out of fuel and we went out to scavenge. We found a house and knocked on the door. A young Croat woman answered and asked who we were. Boris pulled McCourt and Valter out of the way and said to her in an Istrian accent \"We're the Croatian army we would like to know if you have any diesel or know where the nearest petrol station is\" the woman responded \"Hold on we've got some, would you like to come in?\" there was a storm cloud above us and we opened the door. \"Would she be able to tell if we're Chetniks and not Ustashas?\" Babi\u0107 wondered and Zupan responded \"I don't even know who we're fighting half the time\". \"Ah boys let me out of the way\" said Draza as he approached the woman and pushed her down. \"Draza you fucking incest bastard get off of her\" shouted McCourt pointing his rifle at him. A young boy then walked into the kitchen and Tito shouted \"Fucking hell Draza what's wrong with you? Get off her\". Draza ripped off the woman's shirt as the boy called for her \"Fuck it\" shouted McCourt as he drew his pistol and shot Draza twice \"Sorry it had to come to this\" said to him and then shot him in the face. Me, Boris and Valter ran over to girl, she was shaken but unhurt. The woman's name was Vera, she was an accretive woman with long brown hair and worked as a school teacher in a nearby village. She told us her husband was killed when his car was bombed by artillery. She got on well with Paddy, Tito and Novak since she shared their political views but it was Tito whom she got on well the most with due to them being both teachers. \"Wouldn't you get in trouble for having us here?\" I asked her and she replied \"Maybe but no one comes up here that often but I'm leaving in a few days with my brother and his family, you can have this house\". Novak then told her about Greece which she replied \"Greece? How are you going to get there?\" and she had a point, we were still in north-western Bosnia. I got up from the table to get a glass of Coke. I looked at where Vera was almost violated and I was amazed how we cleaned Draza's blood up so well. After getting my drink I went outside were Boris, Valter, Tony and Vlado were playing football with Vera's son. It had hit me more of what kind of war we were fighting, a Croat woman had let us, Serb soldiers to stay in her house and outside her son plays and talks about sports to four of them. We were leaving after breakfast and Zupan decided to stay with Vera and Darijo. \"Why do you want to stay?\" Novak asked him and he told him \"We're a long way from Greece major and I don't want to fight. I also want to make sure these two make it to Croatia alive\" Novak acknowledged as we walked back to the jeep. We had driven a while longer until the engine blew. Chapter 10 Edit McCourt was looking at the engine. \"I can fix it but our tools were with Zupan\" he told me and Novak. It was too far to go back to him now anyway but to make matters worse a sniper started firing at us. As we ran for cover Tony was hit in the foot so I went back to help him. I carried him to a rock where the rest of us were hiding from the sniper. He was had lost most of his left foot. Our medical equipment was still on Bobienski's corpse but McCourt remembered the first aid kit in the jeep. \"I'll go\" said Vlado getting up and Valter asked why to which he was replied \"Jackie you know I always get through besides I lived a good life, Cuba doesn't matter anymore\". We then heard machinegun fire and Vlado came quickly running up to us with the first aid kit and unscratched. \"FUCKING RUN\" he shouted and we went to find more cover. We eventually found some trenches that were dug in the beginning of the war. We applied bandages to Tony's foot. \"Now you're going to have to lose that foot son\" Novak said to him and he replied \"It doesn't matter, if I don't I die and that's what's going to happen isn't it?\" Boris then comforted him \"There's a Paralympics you do know that right kid?\" and Tony nodded in acknowledgement. We sat back dazed. Valter then said to Boris \"The kid does have a point, if he doesn't lose that leg he's on the mantel piece or a meter underground. We don't have any medical equipment and even if we did we still wouldn't have anything to sterilise them with. I closed my eyes and drifted off. Chapter 11 Edit\" <mark>Vladimir</mark> it's just a helicopter even Mi\u0161o will say it's just one \"I said to <mark>Vladimir</mark> as we walked to Boris' house. It was a warm summer's day back in 1981. We knocked on the door and Dana, Boris' mother answered it .\" Zdravo boys Bor...it's Mi\u0161o you call him right? Anyway he's just in the sitting room watching TV. \"Boris <mark>Milan</mark> and <mark>Vladimir</mark> are here!\" she shouted down the hall. She was a very pretty woman and worked in our school. <mark>Vladimir</mark> couldn't help staring at her every time she bent over, he always did this when we were at the Kova\u010d's and I couldn't blame him. \"Boris did you hear me?\" she shouted again and then Boris came up. \"Go on get some fresh air Boris. Zdravo, lunch will be ready at half\" she said as we left the house. \"Hej Mi\u0161o we want to show you something\" <mark>Vladimir</mark> said as we walked back to the helicopter. \"Do you not think this is a spaceship him?\" <mark>Vladimir</mark> asked him and Boris replied \"No it's a helicopter, been here since the 60's Mr Ivovi\u0107 said\". A few months ago I remember standing next to a similar helicopter but this one wasn't covered in moss and mildew but with fire and hadn't crashed about fifteen years ago but fifteen minutes ago. Boris pushed me as a shell landed near us. We then ran into a trench. \"Mati, mati, mati\" a young soldier said to himself clutching his helmet. Tito was firing the machinegun at the Bosniak soldiers and Draza with his shotgun. \"Kapetan Jovanovi\u0107 this is Redov Jakob Dravi\u0107 of the fifth army, under the request Zastavnik Zhang reinforcements to be sent to...Poru\u010dnik <mark>Nikoli\u0107</mark>, <mark>Milan</mark> I think...nor sir he's not...\"but before Dravi\u0107 could finish his sentence his head was blown off by a sniper and our radio was busted. Back in 81 we went back to Boris' house after laughing at him for thinking the helicopter was a spaceship. We sat down at the table as Dana gave us our lunch. Nikola came in and Dana asked him why he was early and he told his wife\" I don't think it's good Danica \". Dana then asked him why and he told her\" I got a message from the hospital, its cancer, cancer of the lung \". Dana started crying and ran into her bedroom. Chapter 12 Edit\" So when is Boris going to be back? \"I asked Dana and she told me\" Tomorrow afternoon \". It was five years and a week after we argued about helicopter and I was lonely but I wasn't enough to be marrying my right hand, Dana had invited me in because she knew <mark>Vladimir</mark> was away to family in Vukovar and Boris gave me the wrong date of his arrival back from Fire Island, no shit he went to that Greek island full of gay British people. Dana asked me a question about music\" Do you like Tears to Fears? \"and I said to her\" It's Tears for Fears Dana and yeah they're alright but I prefer our own stuff like Indexi, Elektricni Orgazam you get it don't you? \"and she smiled and nodded in acknowledgement\" Anyway as long as you like them take this cassette \"I thanked her and she put on Proplakat \u0107e Zora. She then sad town and...right before this turns into some erotic literature story I got a shag so I can proudly say I fucked my best friend's mother. The irony is I never once insulted Boris by saying I shagged Dana. I woke up hearing a woman scream. McCourt was trying to calm her down. I looked at her, it was that Danish/Greek journalist we met a while earlier. Going back to when we first met Ms. Irena <mark>Anderson</mark> last month we were walking with Jovanovi\u0107 .\" This is <mark>Milan</mark>'s squad the most mentally challenged, moronic cock suckers in the whole VRS. After General Mladi\u0107 of course \"Jovanovi\u0107 said laughing as he walked away .\" Sorry you speak Danish? \"Irena asked me and I said to her\" You don't look Danish Fr & oslash; <mark>ken Anderson</mark> \"then she told me\" My mother is from Greece, Crete Herr L & oslash; jtnant \"I responded to her\" Ah Irena as in Irena Papas right \"and she smiled, nodded her head and said to me\" S & aring; taler du Dansk? \"and I shook my head\" I only know very little Greek \"and she then asked me if I knew German or English\" No English I'm quite good at German but \".\" Ich bin Poru\u010dnik, dass L & oslash; jtnant <mark>Milan Nikoli\u0107</mark> der VRS ist. Ich komme aus einer Stadt im Nordwesten Bosnien, die Heimat von allen drei gro & szlig; en ethnischen Gruppen vor dem Krieg war \"she then asked to interview another soldier and I called Paddy .\" Paddy this is Irena she's a Danish journalist \"I told him and he said\" I don't speak Danish \"I replied\" You speak English but, just tell her about yourself \". Paddy started speaking to her in English\" Hilsner my name is Vladen McCourt better known as Paddy by everyone who isn't a McCourt. If you're wondering about my weird surname it's because my grandfather moved here in the 1950's to escape the evil papist rule of Eamon De Valera and his master the pope. I am a stoner from Bijeljina where I worked as a tow-truck operator. My father worked for the Ministry of the Interior, figures he's Irish and my mother works for a pharmacy. I grew up Serbian Orthodox but I currently practise Buddhism, Rastafarianism, Mormonism and Celtic and Slavic folk religion yes you're aware it's all bullshit \"Irena laughed and McCourt continued\" My heroes are of course <mark>James Connolly</mark> and <mark>Michael Collins</mark> who wanted a free Ireland which De Valera ruined anyway by sucking off the Church of Rome but my other heroes are Bobby Sands aka Jesus, the Dutch guy who legalised weed, Bob Marley, Sergeant Oddball, Bata \u017divojinovi\u0107, Arafat and the Fonz but my number one real hero is Nelson Mandela. You know he stood up to the fascist oppression against Black people in South Africa, his people the real people of South Africa were oppressed by Dutch colonists who make up about a 10% of the country and last week he became president of South Africa. One day I'll become president and reunite Yugoslavia just like Comrade Mandela helped the real South Africans gain equality and like how they are bringing down the fascist apartheid regime we will bring down the fascist genocidal regimes of our countries. When I get power capitalists like that old bitch Maggie, fascists like Slobo, Chetniks, conservatives, those pro-incest bead rattlers who cry over abortion and Polish Jew Nazis like the ones who rule Israel will be crushed. You better have this down all down Miss <mark>Anderson</mark> \"Irena said to him\" Sure do, how do you know I'm called <mark>Anderson</mark>? \"and he told her\" You're Danish \"\"You're Danish\" quoted Irena as she lay next do Paddy. \"What brings you back?\" asked Vlado \"I found my way\" she told him. \"Your Serbian is getting better\" I said to her before Novak asked her \"Did you see anything where we could take cover?\" and she told him \"Yes there's a cave up on there. We then ran up there and as soon as we did the Croatians started firing on us. Valter was wounded but we managed to get him there. Chapter 13 Edit When we got to the cave we sat down. Irena took out a video camera .\" What are you doing? \"Novak asked politely but he was willing to take the camera off her and McCourt said to her\" La majoro \u015datus scii kion vi faras? \"\"Du sprichst Esperanto?\" she responded and Paddy replied \"Ja, ja und falls man nicht tun will er das Ziel, Sie nehmen Ihre Kamera kennen\". Irena then told Novak \"Alles, was ich tun m\u00f6chte, ist filmt Ihr M\u00e4nner und fragen sie \u00fcber ihre Vergangenheit. Es gibt nicht viel \u00fcber die Armee .\" Novak then turned to McCourt and asked him \"Please translate\" which McCourt did \"She says she only wants to film us and ask us about our lives, she doesn't want to get involved with military matters\" Novak then smiled and said \"Film weg war ich nicht, Sie zu stoppen\". As the major walked away I asked him why he didn't speak German and he responded \"I used to, forty years in the service you tend to forget things\". Paddy then asked Irena about her camera which she responded with in broken Serbian \"I get camera because you made speak speech back on frontline, do not worry I got it all down but and it was...made into Danish\" Vlado then added \"What was made into a Danish?\" and Paddy quickly replied \"\u00c9ist do bh\u00e9al\". \"Can I interview you Narednik?\" Irena asked and Vlado nodded with a grin. Paddy came over to me and asked me a question \"Hej remember P\u00f3l?\" and I answered \"The Irish peacekeeper sure I remember him\" Paddy continued \"Well the stash is on the other side of this cave\". I waited a few seconds before opening my mouth \"There's another side to this cave?\" I had asked and Paddy replied \"Yeah but keep it quiet let us rest a while\". P\u00f3l was an Irish peacekeeper and Paddy's counterpart. He was married to a Serbian woman from Belgrade and that's how I presume he knew our language. He and Paddy were talking about weed and they thought I wouldn't find out by calling it \"fiaile\" whether that's the Irish for what drives English housewives mad or the thing their sons go to Holland for I don't know but at the end of their conversation I asked McCourt was he talking about cannabis and he replied with \"How did you know?\" Retrieved from \"http: //codfanfic.wikia.com/wiki/Bosnia_Nights? oldid=66218\" ", "articleID": "2016022320_00545384_W", "names": {"James Connolly": ["Q16066341", "Q22003703"], "Ken Anderson": ["Q11738690", "Q16165619", "Q19609582", "Q297240", "Q3195010", "Q6387236"], "Michael Collins": ["Q104859", "Q11989252", "Q16194009", "Q1927172", "Q1927175", "Q20090483", "Q21458653", "Q23006319", "Q24631029", "Q3308116", "Q3308121", "Q3856136", "Q6829378", "Q6829379", "Q6829380", "Q6829382", "Q6829383", "Q6829384", "Q6829385", "Q6829386", "Q6829387"], "Milan Nikoli\u0107": ["Q3207761", "Q6850641", "Q971923", "Q983518"], "Vladimir Vu\u010dkovi\u0107": ["Q25459198", "Q31186711"]}}, {"date": "2016-04-19", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/amended-version-medicaid-funding-bill-advances", "content": "Amended version of Medicaid funding bill advances Amended version of Medicaid funding bill advances Gov. Asa Hutchinson talks to reporters Tuesday at the state Capitol. (Dale Ellis photo) By <mark>John Lyon</mark> jlyon @ arkansasnews.com LITTLE ROCK--A legislative committee on Tuesday advanced an amended version of a bill to appropriate funding for the state Medicaid program, including Gov. Asa Hutchinson's Medicaid expansion plan. The Joint Budget Committee advanced Senate Bill 121 after adopting an amendment that would end Medicaid expansion on Dec. 31 of this year, but <mark>Hutchinson</mark> has said he will use a line-item veto to remove the sunset provision if the bill reaches his desk. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday. Sen. Jim Hendren, R-Gravette, the governor's nephew, presented the amendment as a way to maneuver around the opposition of 10 Republican senators who have blocked funding for the governor's Medicaid expansion plan, titled Arkansas Works. Nine votes are enough to block an appropriation bill requiring a three-fourths vote in the 35-member Senate. <mark>Hutchinson</mark> has said three of the 10 senators who oppose Arkansas Works have told him they are willing to go along with the veto strategy. The Joint Budget Committee had rejected an amendment Thursday that would have removed funding for Arkansas Works from the bill, also with a line-item veto promised. Hendren said Tuesday the new amendment is an improvement on the first. \"Working with Democrats and the attorneys, they pointed out that a provision like this is more defendable in court than a more restrictive measure to prohibit funds from being spent,\" he said. The new amendment also contains language stating that all provisions of the bill are severable, meaning that if any one provision is ruled invalid, the other provisions will still be valid. <mark>Hutchinson</mark> told reporters Tuesday the new amendment \"is probably more clear, and it minimizes any legal challenge that might take place .\" \"The other good thing about it is that this has really brought us together, both Democrats and Republicans, as we sought this solution. This really reflects the best of the legislative process, where we don't reject good ideas, we embrace good ideas,\" he said. More than 267,000 low-income people have obtained insurance under Arkansas' current Medicaid expansion program since it was created in 2013 as an alternative to the expansion of Medicaid rolls proposed under the federal Affordable Care Act. Arkansas Works would add features such as referrals to work training for unemployed recipients and small premiums for people earning between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. During debate on the amendment in the budget committee, Hendren said, \"We know that if we fail (to pass Arkansas Works), 270,000 people are going to lose their insurance. We know that if we fail, $1 billion a year for the next five years is going to be pulled out of Arkansas' health-care system. We know that if we fail, our budget's going to have some real challenges ahead .\" Rep. <mark>Charlotte Douglas</mark>, R-Alma, said the three-fourths majority requirement for appropriations bills exists as a safeguard. \"I think that we are overlooking an important piece of the equation here when we do not honor the people of Arkansas and what they think should go on up here--the integrity, the ethics, and how they feel like business should be conducted,\" she said. Sen. <mark>Jeremy Hutchinson</mark>, R-Little Rock, also the governor's nephew, said the line-item veto power was approved by Arkansas voters and that \"nobody is doing anything underhanded or with a lack of integrity .\" Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, who last week said he was concerned about Arkansas Works providing coverage for the so-called morning-after pill, provided committee members with a letter from the governor pledging to pursue a federal waiver to allow Arkansas to exclude coverage for emergency contraception from the traditional Medicaid program and inquire about the state's options related to excluding the coverage from Medicaid expansion. The amendment passed 41-11. The committee sent the bill to the Senate in a voice vote. Most Democrats on the committee voted against the amendment that was offered Thursday, but most voted for the amendment offered Tuesday. \"I think it's a good demonstration of, if you just take a deep breath you can come up with better ideas,\" Senate Minority Leader Keith Ingram, D-West Memphis, said after the vote. Earlier Tuesday, a group of opponents of Arkansas Works held a news conference to propose several changes to Arkansas Works that they said would make the program acceptable to them, including restricting coverage to people earning up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level instead of 138 percent and moving them to traditional Medicaid. \"The ACA introduced new government spending while we are hurtling toward a fiscal cliff,\" said Sen. <mark>Alan Clark</mark>, R-Lonsdale. \"We have passed $19 trillion in debt in this country and have passed our gross domestic product. Few, if any, nations have ever survived this milestone .\" The Legislature approved Arkansas Works during a special session earlier this month. The governor said Tuesday that the policy has been decided and that funding it is \"what we're focusing on .\" The House on Tuesday voted down the General Appropriation Act for the second time. The state constitution requires that the Legislature pass the bill, which funds expenses of the Legislature and the judicial branch, before passing any other bill in a session. House Democrats have been blocking the General Appropriation Act while legislators work to resolve the impasse in the Senate over Arkansas Works. _____", "articleID": "2016041923_00434195_W", "names": {"Alan Clark": ["Q15378814", "Q16204309", "Q18685443", "Q21453460", "Q676375"], "Charlotte Douglas": ["Q16151703", "Q18239008", "Q54804421"], "Jeremy Hutchinson": ["Q1374545", "Q6181510"], "John Lyon": ["Q6184503", "Q6245630", "Q6245631", "Q6245632"]}}]
