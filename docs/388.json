Economist <mark>John Edwards</mark>, who ended his five-year term as a board member last year, believes official interest rates could rise eight times over the next two years, based on the central bank's present economic forecasts. That would add hundreds of dollars to monthly mortgage payments. But the boss of one of the big four banks disagrees with the <mark>Edwards</mark> assessement. ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said it was difficult to see interest rate increases anytime soon when Australia was struggling with below-trend economic growth and wage growth that was almost non-existent. \"I think it is hard to lay a case that says\" gee we are going to see significant interests rate rises', \"he told ABC radio on Thursday. Many households wouldn't be able to afford such increases .\" I think we need to be very careful. \"<mark>John</mark> Kolenda, managing director of mortgage broker 1300HomeLoan, said a rapid rise in interest rates would be disastrous to already fragile consumer confidence .\" The impact of a number of rate rises by the RBA will just terrify consumers and prompt them to tighten their belts dramatically, \"he said. It is a point made by the global central banking authority, the Bank for International Settlements, in a report this week, which cited Australia among a handful of other countries where household debt is on the rise .\" Increases in interest rates beyond what is currently priced in markets could weaken consumption considerably, \"the central bank to central banks said. If Dr <mark>Edwards</mark>, a former adviser to <mark>Paul Keating</mark>, is correct it would take the Reserve Bank's cash rate to 3.5 per cent from a record low 1.5 per cent, where it has stood since August last year. But financial markets are predicting just a single quarter of a percentage point increase by the end of 2018. Deloitte Access Economics economist <mark>Chris Richardson</mark> also expects higher interest rates, but not to the same extent as Dr <mark>Edwards</mark>.\" We wouldn't see interest rates in Australia rise at all until sometime in 2018, probably a year from now, and by the end of 2018 you might have seen two interest rate rises, \"he told ABC radio. The Reserve Bank will hold its monthly board meeting on Tuesday next week.", "articleID": "2017062905_00083005_W", "names": {"Paul Keating": ["Q15452628", "Q242654"]}}, {"date": "2017-06-29", "url": "http://www.theobserver.ca/2017/06/29/bluewater-health-adds-8-larger-rooms-accommodating-for-larger-families-and-indigenous-birthing-rituals", "content": "Bluewater Health adds 8 larger rooms accommodating for larger families and Indigenous birthing rituals By Jeremiah Rodriguez, Postmedia Network Thursday, June 29, 2017 3:31:57 EDT PM Previous Next First Nation dancers performing a dance during the drum ceremony at Bluewater Health Hospital inaugurating new multi-purpose rooms in maternity ward. (JEREMIAH RODRIGUEZ / THE SARNIA OBSERVER) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Forget waiting rooms, large families will now be able to comfortably fit in the same room where a mother goes in labour to recovery as Bluewater Health adds eight large unique birthing rooms Thursday. The new rooms, funded by Bluewater Health Foundation, allow for a new birthing experience where larger families, especially Indigenous ones, can stay in the same room where labour, birthing and then recovery all will take place. \"Indigenous population generally come with larger extended families and we really wanted to give them space,\" Sally Jenkins, director of the Maternal, Infant Child program, said. \"It's part of their culture and they have big celebrations .\" Marked by a ribbon-cutting and an Indigenous dancing and drumming ceremony, one of the rooms was dedicated and specially designed for Indigenous families but are open for everyone to use. They include wood panelling, a basin for cedar bath for purification and cleansing and a space for ceremonial smudging. \"The rooms are important because it keeps the families together. So they are bigger rooms and they don't get moved,\" Jenkins said. \"It's less disruptive .\" The room was also a part of one of the first joint projects between Aamijiwnaang First Nation Health Centre and Erie St. Clair LHIN's Indigenous advisory panel, said Sarah Plain from the health centre. The new rooms are all larger than both Bluewater's six birthing and 10 postpartum rooms and one of the eight is even larger to accommodate and hold larger families who might wish to take part in the traditional indigenous birthing ceremonies. This larger one is covered in covered in Indigenous art, decorations and a mounted moss bag behind glass not unlike the usable ones that First Nations peoples use to hold newborns, grandmother Liz Plain said. \"My daughter--who is going to be forty soon--I still have hers and has gone down in generations to my recently born grandson,\" Plain said. Although she mentioned that re-using one is rarer in most cases. Bluewater Health sees over a thousand births a year so the new rooms should be a massive help. \"We have a commitment to serving our diverse community and that's why we trying to provide an exemplary birthing experience for all the families in Sarnia and Lambton,\" Dr. <mark>Baljit Singh</mark>, Medical director of the MIC program said. The genesis for the new rooms happened during planning for renovations to create more birthing rooms two years ago, Bluewater reached out to the First Nations community as well as Dr. <mark>Singh</mark> along with staff and physicians all for their input. The rooms themselves were built within one year with the funds donated by the Bluewater Health Foundation.", "articleID": "2017062919_01044196_W", "names": {"Baljit Singh": ["Q4851052", "Q4851053", "Q805002"]}}, {"date": "2017-06-30", "url": "http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/626090/Premier-League-owners-most-money-richest-investments-club-Abramovich-sportgalleries", "content": "The 10 Premier League club owners who have invested the most in their teams WHICH Premier League club owners have put the most money into their clubs? 1 / 10 GETTY 10. <mark>David Sullivan</mark> and <mark>David Gold</mark> - \u00a3 105m in West Ham \"Two different owners for Arsenal and Manchester City both appear in the top 10\" England's top flight's biggest clubs are all bankrolled by rich investors these days, from the USA, Russia, China and elsewhere.

Rec Photo by Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images Dani Ceballos is lighting up the UEFA Under-21 Championship, drawing strong interest from Real Madrid. And now, Barcelona want to swoop in before the Real Betis player goes to the capital, according to MARCA. That report might not come true, of course, because, well...MARCA. But there's also the players' anti-Catalan tweets from a few years ago. \"Be quiet, Gerard Pique, and don't give your opinion about Andalusia, you s ** t Catalan,\" he wrote when he was 16. \"I find the whistling of the national anthem a disgrace,\" another tweet said. \"A bomb needs to fall on the stands and kill all the Catalan and Bizcayan dogs .\" Another sent to Pique and Cesc Fabregas said: \"don't you feel ashamed taking a picture with the Catalan flag? Get out of the country, Catalans .\" Another one simply said: \"I'm disgusted by Catalans, all of them should die already .\" He did have some positive things to say about Barcelona, one time writing: \"This Barcelona isn't normal, with the way Lionel Messi receives the ball in the middle of the pitch, does a PlayStation move to Jordi Alba, and then it's a goal from Xavi,\" He also wrote derogatory comments about former Real Madrid keeper <mark>Iker Casillas</mark> and his wife Sara Carbonero. On another day he wrote: \"Ronaldo and Mourinho have no shame, disgusted by Madrid .\" The list of inappropriate and/or shameful tweets goes on. In any case, should Barcelona want this young star despite his previous attacks on the likes of Pique and Catalans in general? Or should we just recognize that kids say stupid things ...? After all, he was just 16, and everyone says things they later regret. The difference is most of us didn't write it on Twitter and later become famous footballers. On the other hand, Barcelona has shown they take these kinds of tweets seriously.
