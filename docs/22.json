(imo). not to sound too uninformed, but what's with this war diaz seems like you really don't know why they aren't in the ufc!! sorry if i offended u killit420 y dont u smoke a bomb and forget about it \"while looking forward to the contest, diaz stated in an official release from the organization that he's upset that he'll be forced to hurt <mark>smith</mark> in the presence of his children .\" awesome. glad they did this to sorta fill the gap i think babalu left. this should be another solid strikeforce card! gj guys. it's interesting how people always say diaz has no power but the majority of his fights through his career have ended in him tkoing/koing fighters. i think his record proves he has power he just doesn't use in every punch. he peppers you then when you start to wear down he sets up the big power shot. we've seen him do it time after time in his career. i'm tired of waiting, i want to see nick back in the ufc, like him or not, he shows up to fight every single time. he doesn't fight \"not to lose\" and i as a mma appreciate that, despite his antics. more dudes who will put on the line please!! i still cant believe diaz demolished shamrock how he did. either shamrock was never as good as i thought he was or his skills have declined severely. or he is just fighting with the mentality of a ameteur these days for reasons that evade me. perhaps he thinks making himself a sacrificial lamb and standing there as a open target is entertaining the fans? i cant help but feel that something was wrong with shamrock that night because he was like a walking punchbag. has anyone seen the youtube videos of shamrock submitting legends like <mark>dan henderson</mark> in seconds in submission competitions? how shamrock submitted ground and pounders like tito. how he won against the likes of bas rutten? all due respect to frank shamrock, but diaz is a really decent boxer, and his jujitsu is fantastic. the difference, though, was his hands. he uses lots of jabs, and they might not look like much, but they a) frustrate the hell out of his opponents, b) keep them at a distance, c) sets them up for the bigger shots. seems like such a simple thing, but if you look at mma across the board, jabs are underused sorta like leg kicks, but both of those aspects seem to be making the difference in many fights. frank was the prototype of the complete mma fighter back in his heyday (and i agree, he's not finished at 36), but i don't believe he has imrpoved his style enough to be able to beat a guy as talented as diaz on most days. omg! this fight announcement is awesome! and i don't care what anyone says, in my opinion this is the fight i am most looking forward to in the future. it trumps everything else. yes indeed. this is gonna be a great night for mma! i love watching both of these guys fight, and interview, and for totally different reasons. i've got kids too, so <mark>smith</mark> usually has the heart strings attatched when he fights. i can't help but like the way diaz $hit talkes his opponents, when he feels it's deserved. so far i haven't heard him say anything bad about <mark>smith</mark>, other than the thing about beating him up in front of his kids. that's really not so bad. we'll see if any sparks fly before the fight, but there's sure to be fireworks in the cage! this'll be a tough one for ufc to counter, other than spike is free. i wonder which one they'll play. not to sound too uninformed, but what's with this war diaz thing? i keep seeing war (fill in the fighter). war diaz is just that. two dude in a cage going to war with one winnir nick diaz!!!!!!!!!!!!! as far as all the diaz haters diaz already knocked out lawler! as for why he couldn't corner his bro that was that bs weed suspencion. hell he got a crip for it. nick diaz la times interview by lance pugmire april 9, 2009 by lance pugmire april 9, 2009 for mainstream sports fans thirsting for an athlete to come completely clean about taboo subjects in sports, here's an introduction to mixed martial arts fighter nick diaz, who not only speaks openly but is willing to answer follow-up questions. \"i'm more consistent about everything being a cannabis user,\" diaz said in an interview with the times last week. \"i'm happy to get loaded, hear some good music...i remain consistent. and i have an easy way to deal with [the drug tests].\" i can pass a drug test in eight days with herbal cleansers. i drink 10 pounds of water and sweat out 10 pounds of water every day. i'll be fine. \"stockton's diaz, 25, is pitted against mma veteran frank shamrock on saturday night in san jose in the main event of the first strikeforce card on showtime since the former promotional organization elite xc folded last year.strikeforce inherited much of the elite xc roster, and shamrock-diaz will be a 179-pound catchweight bout as shamrock moves down from 185 and diaz moves up from 160 .\" this is a super important fight--for showtime to show the mma world there's a clear alternative to the ufc--and that's exactly why you're seeing this matchup of exciting, forward-moving fighters who bang, \"shamrock, 36, said .\" i respect [diaz's] talent, he brings it. \"what diaz brings beyond flying fists and the ability to shut off a foe's breathing by holding the opponent's throat against his bottom leg is unbending honesty about his marijuana use, his frustration with his former bosses at the ultimate fighting championship and his belief that steroids are pervasive in his sport .\" let 'em do it, they'll have a shorter career than me, \"said diaz (18-7 with 10 knockouts, five submissions and a no-contest).\" with all that wear and tear on their tendons, something's going to explode. i feel like these guys are hurting themselves. you can't consistently fight on steroids. \"unfortunately for diaz, state athletic commissions also ban marijuana use, and he tested positive for the illegal drug in las vegas after his impressive win over japan's takanori gomi in early 2007. a state athletic commissioner in nevada argued diaz was numb to pain because of excessive marijuana in his system. diaz's victory was vacated; he was fined and suspended for six months .\" the drug is banned because of the damage it does to the person taking it, \"said keith kizer, nevada state athletic commission executive officer .\" it could make you lethargic, slow your reflexes, and those are dangerous things in a combat sport. \"the california state athletic commission said diaz would undergo drug testing before and after saturday's fight. diaz, however, argues marijuana eases problems he has battled since childhood when, he says, he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and prescribed mood-altering medication. his rebellion as a youth forced him to relocate to schools where he continually felt out of place and he ultimately became a high school dropout .\" i like the idea of being able to fight my way out of something, \"diaz said.diaz fought on his first professional mma card at 18 and was on the ufc roster two years later. he was 7-4 in mma's premier organization, losing to two fighters who have since been suspended for steroids (sean sherk) and pain-killers (karo parisyan) and dropping another decision to current ufc lightweight title contender diego sanchez.in 2006, diaz was extended an invitation to compete on the ufc's popular\" the ultimate fighter 4 \"reality television series. he said he didn't like the idea of being continually followed by cameras and speculated his presence was more a threatened order than a request.shortly after, diaz and the ufc parted ways, although his brother nate still fights in the organization. in nick's first post-ufc fight, he tested positive for marijuana. he suspects someone tipped off authorities .\" i got high in my [hotel] room the night before every [ufc] fight, \"diaz said. but kizer said diaz was merely among 10 of 16 pride fighting championships athletes who were tested that night.diaz is 4-1 since, earning a brazilian jujitsu black belt in 2007 and complementing his intense mma training by competing in triathlons. on march 29, diaz finished fourth in his age group in an event in sacramento as part of his training for saturday's fight.said shamrock of diaz:\" he definitely smokes marijuana. that's his own business, but it's not the greatest thing for the sport. we're fighting a stigma. still, there's something refreshing about his honesty. \"diaz says he believes mma fans admire his attitude, more so than his peers .\" i don't worry about the sport, i worry about my own...teeth getting kicked in, \"diaz said. cesar pre-fight interview by <mark>michael david smith</mark> nick diaz has created quite a stir in mma circles this week by telling the los angeles times that he smokes marijuana and drinks large quantities of water to help him pass drug tests before and after his fights. i requested an interview with diaz to ask him to explain those comments, and diaz, through spokesmen, declined.but on friday i caught up with diaz's coach and manager, cesar gracie, for an interview in which we discussed diaz's marijuana use and his fight on saturday night with frank shamrock. the full interview, which touches on everything from michael phelps to diaz's participation in triathlons to the family tree of the legendary gracies, is below.michael <mark>david smith</mark>: nick told the los angeles times that he smokes marijuana. what do you make of those comments? cesar gracie: nick has a prescription for marijuana in california. he has had a prescription for the last couple years, so it's a legal drug for him. he has the prescription for adhd (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), and he says it helps him. i'm not a doctor, but he says it helps him and using marijuana is legal in california with a prescription. obviously, i'd rather he focus more on talking about fighting than on being a cannabis spokesperson, but he has a right to do what's legal in california, so i don't think it's that big a deal. it's legal by california law, but he still has to pass a test from the california state athletic commission, and he'll be in trouble if he tests positive, right? cesar: if he tests positive, yes. but what he'll do is not smoke for weeks leading up to the fight so he'll test negative. he's fought in california and passed the marijuana test. so it all worked out.he said he drinks 10 pounds of water a day. i interpreted that as saying that large quantities of water help you get the drugs out of your system. is that what he meant by that? cesar: i beileve so. he was talking about not smoking and flushing it out of his system. as much as he exercises, he burns off fat and flushes it out of his system. but remember, in california it's legal. you just can't be stoned during your fight--you can't test positive during your fight.your name is legendary in mma and brazilian jiu jitsu. what is your opinion of whether smoking marijuana is consistent with being an mma fighter or a brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner? cesar: i would have always said no, and i've told nick several times,\" athletes can't do this. \"but i guess i've been proven wrong. look at michael phelps. look at nick, who fights and does triathlons. i definitely wouldn't encourage people to use marijuana. it's my personal opinion that any kind of smoke, whether it be cigarette smoke or marijuana smoke isn't good. common sense would say it's detrimental. watching nick fight, and knowing that he participates in triathlons, it's obvious that he has very good cardio. i would think that wouldn't be consistent with smoking anything, but he has good cardio and obviously michael phelps has good cardio. cesar: i'm not a scientist and i'm not a doctor. i would be concerned with long term, 20 years from now what are his lungs going to look like? i just wouldn't gamble with that. most of the people i've met in my life who are habitual marijuana smokers are couch potatoes and don't have a lot of motivation. obviously guys like phelps, and other athletes who smoke marijuana--i've heard of pro football players smoking marijuana and they are still great athletes .--i just don't have a right to tell them don't have a beer and i also don't have a right to say not to smoke marijuana. it's a medical prescription that he has a prescription for. i don't think it's that big of a deal. it's not cheating. remember, the athletic commission, their argument for banning marijuana is actually that it could hurt you--you could be lethargic and unable to protect yourself. it's not cheating, it's that it could be to your detriment. that's why they don't want you to be on it. it's not like steroids. i think the media should focus on serious issues like steroids and pain pills, not minor issues like this.let's talk about the fight. you have fought frank shamrock. what's your scouting report on him? cesar: i think he's a hard hitter. he's an athlete. he's explosive. he's very strong. he's a really good mma striker. he's got so much experience and he brings that experience into the cage with him, so you're not going to surprise him. he's got a winner's mentality. he's going to make you earn it, for sure. i was a little surprised when this fight was announced, just because nick has fought at lightweight and frank shamrock has fought at middleweight. is 179 pounds a good weight for this fight? cesar: nick would have taken that fight at any weight. he's a fighter. he's one of those guys who's going to take the fight because he wants the challenge. when he was fighting at lightweight, that was a tremendous cut for him and i really didn't like to see him that light. it took him a long time to get there and i don't think he was at his best at lightweight. i think nick and frank will walk into the cage at about the same weight. obviously frank is more used to fighting around that weight so that might be an advantage. we're a couple of hours from the weigh in. what will nick weigh in at today? cesar: about 180, same as frank, probably. the weight class is 179 with a one-pound allowance, so i assume both guys will come in at 180. what kind of shape is nick in right now? will he have any rust because he hasn't fought in a while? cesar: it's been a while but frank is coming off a layoff and his arm was broken from a kick. he's in good shape and i think it's going to be a good fight.how do you think strikeforce is coming along after buying the elitexc assets? cesar: it's doing well. i've been around some of these mma promotions that were like a dot-com start-up, coming in and spending crazy money, hiring too many people and giving ridiculous contracts to some of the fighters, paying people what they weren't worth. scott coker, the head of strikeforce, is a different kind of planner. he's doing things the right way. i think he's going to be very successful. i know you also coach gilbert melendez, who's on the co-main event. how's he doing and what do you expect us to see from him saturday night? cesar: gilbert is in phenomenal shape. he really is. unfortunately josh thomson broke his leg, and now gilbert is fighting a different kind of opponent in rodrigo damm, so he's having to make some adjustments. he's a dangerous submission specialist with good stand-up and good wrestling skills, so he's well rounded. gilbert doesn't have quite the pedigree in submission grappling that (damm) does, but i think he's ready for this fight and in shape for a five-rounder. you have by far the most famous last name in brazilian jiu jitsu. just to clarify, are you royce gracie's first cousin? cesar: you know, i don't know what that is. second cousin, i think. his father is my great uncle. we've had people in the family having kids until they're 60 years old or something, so it's kind of funny. royce should be a lot older than me. so he's a generation older than you but he's not many years older than you? yeah. exactly. cesar: i think that makes him your cousin once removed.that sounds right. cousin once removed? that sounds good.well, thanks for your time. is there anything else you want to say? cesar: just that i hope it's clear that i'm definitely not a proponent of the whole marijuana thing or whatever ....which makes me think...can anyone else see strikeforce booking", "articleID": "2009042816_00029593_W", "names": {"Michael David Smith": ["Q16885753", "Q6829665"]}}, {"date": "2009-04-30", "url": "http://financialpost.com/reports/oil-watch/story.html?id=1545227", "content": "six big u.s. banks need capital, tests reveal at least six of the 19 largest u.s. banks require additional capital, according to preliminary results of government stress tests, people briefed on the matter said. while some of the lenders may need extra cash injections from the government, most of the capital is likely to come from converting preferred shares to common equity, the people said. the federal reserve is now hearing appeals from banks, including citigroup inc. and bank of america corp., that regulators have determined need more of a cushion against losses, they added. by pushing conversions, rather than federal assistance, the government would allow banks to shore themselves up without the political taint that has soured both wall street and congress on the bailouts. the risk is that, along with diluting existing shareholders, the government action won't seem strong enough. \"the challenge that policy makers will confront is that more will be needed and it's not clear they have the resources currently in place or the political capability to deliver more,\" said david greenlaw, the chief financial economist at morgan stanley, one of the 19 banks that are being tested, in new york. final results of the tests are due to be released next week. the banking agencies overseeing the reviews and the treasury are still debating how much of the information to disclose. fed chairman ben bernanke, treasury secretary timothy geithner and other regulators are scheduled to meet this week to discuss the tests. geithner has said that banks can add capital by a variety of ways, including converting government-held preferred shares dating from capital injections made last year, raising private funds or getting more taxpayer cash. with regulators putting an emphasis on common equity in their stress tests, converting privately held preferred shares is another option. firms that receive exceptional assistance could face stiffer government controls, including the firing of executives or board members, the treasury chief has warned. today, kenneth lewis, chief executive officer of bank of america, faces a shareholder vote on whether he should be re - elected as the company's chairman of the board. while lewis has been at the helm, the bank has received us $45-billion in government aid. scott silvestri, a spokesman for charlotte, north carolina - based bank of america, declined to comment on lewis yesterday. lewis said earlier this month that the firm \"absolutely\" doesn't need more capital, while adding that the decision on whether to convert the u.s.'s previous investments into common equity is \"now out of our hands .\" citigroup, in a statement, said the bank's \"regulatory capital base is strong, and we have previously announced our intention to conduct an exchange offer that will significantly improve our tangible common ratios .\" along with bank of america and new york-based citigroup, some regional banks are likely to need additional capital, analysts have said. suntrust banks inc., keycorp, and regions financial corp. are the banks that are most likely to require additional capital, according to an april 24 analysis by morgan stanley. bank of america advanced 2.6% to us $8.36 in german trading and citigroup climbed 3.5% to us $2.99. suntrust slipped 0.2% to us $13.69 in germany. by taking the less onerous path of converting preferred shares, the treasury is husbanding the diminishing resources from the $700 billion bailout passed by congress last october. \"does that indicate that's what the regulators actually believe, or is it that they felt politically constrained from doing much more than that?\" said douglas elliott, a former investment banker who is now a fellow at the brookings institution in washington. geithner said april 21 that us $109.6-billion of tarp funds remain, or us $134.6-billion including expected repayments in the coming year. lawmakers have warned repeatedly not to expect approval of any request for additional money. some forecasts predict much greater losses are still on the horizon for the financial system. the international monetary fund calculates global losses tied to bad loans and securitized assets may reach us $4.1-trillion next year. geithner has said repeatedly that the \"vast majority\" of u.s. banks have more capital than regulatory guidelines indicate. the stress tests are designed to ensure that firms have enough reserves to weather a deeper economic downturn and sustain lending to consumers and businesses. he also said there are signs of \"thawing\" in credit markets and some indication that confidence is beginning to return. his remarks reflected an improvement in earnings in several lenders' results for the first quarter, and a reduction in benchmark lending rates this month. financial shares are poised for their first back-to-back monthly gain since september 2007. the standard & poor's 500 financials index has climbed 18% this month, while still 73% below the high reached in may 2007. national post - wednesday,

hundreds of commonly used medications. but degefu isn't repackaging medications like your typical corner drugstore. he's making them. degefu is a compounder, a pharmacist who custom-mixes drugs for patients. although they have been around for centuries, compounding pharmacies are getting attention because of the recent deaths of 21 elite polo horses that were given a lethal cocktail of drugs erroneously mixed up by a compounding pharmacy in florida. in contrast to the arduous and expensive process by which new pharmaceutical products come to market, critics say oversight of compounders is spotty and that patients - human and animal - are sometimes given medications that regulators never tested. occasionally, the results are deadly. \"the whole system is full of holes, or maybe it's not even a system,\" said larry sasich, a pharmacist and professor at the lake erie college of osteopathic medicine school of pharmacy in erie, penn. others say they serve a vital role and that mistakes are rare. \"there are just a lot of patients who need a medication that's not commercially manufactured,\" said l.d. king, executive director of the international academy of compounding pharmacists. \"and i think it's well-regulated, and it's improving .\" patients who turn to compounders include people who are allergic to inactive ingredients in fda-approved medicines, or those who need a different dose or a different form of delivery - such as a cream, powder or injectable liquid - than what is commercially available. any licensed pharmacist can compound drugs, but a doctor's prescription is required. the polo horses began dying on april 19, just before a championship match near west palm beach. they were given a cocktail of vitamins and minerals from a florida compounding pharmacy that has acknowledged using too much selenium in the mix. like many others, the pharmacy mixes medications for both animals and people. florida officials later determined that the horses died of an overdose of selenium, a common mineral that is used to combat muscle fatigue but can be toxic at very high doses. from 1990 to 2005, the u.s. food and drug administration documented at least 240 serious illnesses and deaths associated with improperly compounded products. the agency noted that the numbers may be considerably higher because compounders aren't required to report ill effects. still, it's a tiny fraction of the thousands who suffer adverse reactions to manufactured, fda-approved drugs every year. in 2007, three people in oregon died after using a poorly made compounded drug that was 10 times stronger than it was supposed to be. the oregon department of justice sued the texas pharmacy that produced it, later settling the case. while department spokesman <mark>tony green</mark> said oregon officials believe drug compounding has legitimate uses, he added: \"we are concerned that drug compounding creates a loophole for marketing of drugs for purposes that are neither approved nor backed up by science .\" the fda has issued numerous warning letters over the years, but in almost every instance - including the oregon deaths - the pharmacy remains open. in 2006, the fda issued a warning letter to a maryland pharmacy for a bacteria-contaminated solution it created for use in open-heart surgeries. the drug caused severe infections in five patients at a virginia hospital. three of them died. and in 2005, the agency recalled a product that was distributed to eight states after two washington, d.c., patients were blinded and several others injured from use of a compound that was also contaminated with bacteria. there are about 5,000 pharmacies nationwide that specialize in compounding, according to king. they fill about 38 million prescriptions each year - about 1% of the roughly 4 billion prescriptions dispensed annually, he said. but many more traditional pharmacies also do some form of compounding, he said, including walgreens and other national chains. and hospitals also do it regularly. \"hospitals have a huge rate of medication errors, whether it's a wrong dose or a wrong drug,\" king said. \"mistakes are unfortunately all too common in health care and compounding pharmacies are not going to be immune .\" the fda does recognize the need for compounding pharmacies that alter and create medications to meet patients' needs, but the agency considers them all unapproved drugs and has not verified their safety or effectiveness. instead, regulation is left mostly to the states, but the rules vary from state to state and enforcement is sparse, said sasich, who called it a \"shadowy industry\" operating under standards \"more akin to the third world .\" and unlike drug manufacturers, compounders don't need to have their products tested before giving them to patients. in a 2006 study of compounded drugs, including female hormone medications, inhalation products, and local anesthetics, fda tests of 36 samples found that 12, or 33%, failed quality standards, including potency requirements. according to the study, the potency of the drugs ranged from 67.5% to 268.4% of the level declared on the product's label. by contrast, the agency's routine sampling of thousands of drug products made by commercial manufacturers yields a failure rate of less than 2%. \"the quality of compounded drugs creates an important public health concern,\" the agency wrote in its findings. still, the fda recognizes the need for compounding pharmacies that serve patients whose medications are not commercially available, agency spokesman <mark>christopher kelly</mark> said. basically, the fda recognizes the need, but doesn't officially condone the practice. \"that opens up pandora's box and a whole gray area, and that's where we all find ourselves,\" said dr. eleanor m. <mark>green</mark>, dean of the college of veterinary medicine and biomedical sciences at texas a & m university. \"and not all physicians and veterinarians clearly understand the issue .\" dr. eugene mironer, medical director at the greenville, s.c.-based carolina center for advanced management of pain, often turns to compounders to convert drugs into creams or gels when they aren't available in those forms. he also occasionally asks compounders to create more affordable versions of fda-approved drugs, or higher or lower dosages. and in some instances, he has medications made that are not fda-approved for treatment of a specific ailment. \"we use quite a few things that fda has not approved for certain uses,\" mironer said. \"we don't need to follow exactly how they have approved it for use. we do whatever is benefiting the patients .\" to report corrections and clarifications, contact reader editor <mark>brent jones</mark>.

manchester united swept back into the champions league final as the holders produced a stunning 3-1 win over arsenal in tuesday's semi-final second leg. sir alex ferguson's side arrived at the emirates stadium holding only a slender 1-0 lead from last week's first leg, but united scored twice in the first 11 minutes to set up a 4-1 aggregate triumph that booked their place in the final against chelsea or barcelona, who meet in their decider wednesday. ferguson said that he had been pleased with his side's display .\" obviously we got a big break for the first goal with the lad (kieran gibbs) slipping and park ji-sung took advantage. however, in terms of how we played and our confidence and willingness to run it was overall a terrific display, \"said ferguson. united, who beat chelsea in last year's final, were given a helping hand from arsenal as south korea winger park ji-sung punished an embarrassing slip from kieran gibbs to open the scoring. cristiano ronaldo then deceived manuel almunia with a long-range free-kick, and the portuguese striker put the result beyond doubt when he added his second goal after half-time .\" i think i am back to my best, yes, \"said ronaldo .\" certainly in the last few games. but i always try to play good all the time. \"sometimes it is not possible\" arsenal barely tested united keeper edwin van der sar until robin van persie converted a late penalty after <mark>darren fletcher</mark> was sent off, ruling him out of the final, for a foul on cesc fabregas. ferguson was upset for the scotland star. \"i think he was unlucky, because the ball certainly moved in a different direction after the contact in the area. he was terribly unlucky .\" however, the referee (roberto rosetti, who took charge of the euro 2008 final) is one of the best in europe. <mark>darren</mark> would probably have played a large part in the final. \"even that couldn't detract from a fantastic display from united, who are the first defending champions to reach the final since juventus in 1997. they were simply outstanding and exposed the flaws in arsene wenger's inexperienced, injury-hit team with ruthless efficiency. no team has retained the trophy in the champions league era, but united are hitting new heights and, with the club world cup and league cup already won and the premier league within touching distance, ferguson and company are close to a memorable quadruple.", "articleID": "2009050621_00085041_W", "names": {"Darren Fletcher": ["Q172792", "Q30122681"]}}, {"date": "2009-05-07", "url": "http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/index.php?title=Borg&diff=3821198&oldid=prev", "content": "from uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia.

swedish cyborgs who use incredibly advanced technology to \"assimilate\" others into their collective so as to make themselves more perfect. they move from planet to planet, incorporating the inhabitants and their technology into the <mark>borg</mark> collective and stripping planets of all resources. although repeated assertions have been made that they bear an uncanny resemblance to microsoft, any such comparison is angrily rejected by the <mark>borg</mark>. incorporation into the <mark>borg</mark> turns a person into a robotic being, a rigid, soulless automaton devoid of character, individuality, or emotion, rather like keanu reeves or hillary clinton. despite being so advanced, whenever the <mark>borg</mark> walk they stagger around in a stiff and clumsy fashion,

makes us harder .\" ~ the <mark>borg</mark> on being perverted the <mark>borg</mark> were created when a bdsm club catering exclusively to leatherclad homosexual men entered a spatiotemporal rift presumably caused by a fisting paradox and was jettisoned into a protoplasmic soup of inanimate nanotech on the far side of the galaxy. this mysterious primordial ocean of liquid nanotech then came to life devouring the intruders. but the gay psyche was too strong and came to dominate the nanotech, upon which the <mark>borg</mark> arose out of the protoplasma with only one goal: assimilate! borgification \"in soviet russia, you assimilate <mark>borg</mark>!\" ~ luc-picard on borgification <mark>borg</mark> nanoprobes in action. the process of being assimilated is called borgification. the <mark>borg</mark> remove useless parts of the organic being (such as that little thingy that hangs down in the back of your throat) and the body is upgraded with the installation of cybernetic components, for instance, microchips, fiber optics, lithium power cells, lasers, lots and lots of wires and cables and hoses, inkjet printers, servo motors, toasters, and a robotic little thingy to hang down the back of your throat. during the process the individual is forced to watch \"barney and friends meets teletubbies\" on a windows computer for three days straight to break down any remaining traces of soul or consciousness. the resulting borgified human is a soulless drone without any individuality, a mere cog in a vast, unfeeling machine of destruction. on the plus side, you now have the ability to store up to 200 hours of music on your built-in 30 gb hard drive. there is talk of a huge 1tb hard drive for some <mark>borg</mark>, but these are unlikely to be implemented soon, as google have used up most of the universe's available disk space. species of the collective every time you exploit that joke, the <mark>borg</mark> assimilates a kitten! thousands of species from millions of worlds contribute to the <mark>borg</mark> collective, including humans, romulans, cardassians, sporks and vulcans. however, not all <mark>borg</mark> member species are humanoid. among the non-humanoid <mark>borg</mark> are the cute little kitten pictured here. <mark>borg</mark> vessels may also include borgified pets such as goldfish, parrots and turtles, or livestock such as cows and llamas. after all, there's no particular reason the species you assimilate has to be intelligent if you're just going to subsume it into a hive-mind anyway. the lack of prehensile appendages can quickly be fixed by attaching a spare human arm or two. however, the problem with assimilating too many species without opposable thumbs is that unless you've got a lot of extra human appendages laying around, the collective quickly ends up short-handed. after the destruction of the <mark>borg</mark> queen's vessel, the <mark>borg</mark> where forced to influence alies, like the ottoman empire in the 19th century. enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> consist of pretty much anybody who isn't <mark>borg</mark>. in no particular order: the federation. the <mark>borg</mark> launched an attack on earth to assimilate its population. they were only stopped when skynet and dr. who's cybermen launched copyright-infringement lawsuits against them. the klingons. the <mark>borg</mark> have decided to simply exterminate the klingons rather than assimilate them, because it's really a pain in the ass to get metal components to stick onto those funky foreheads. the fjord. the fjord are a race which split off from the main <mark>borg</mark> collective thousands of years ago. they are exactly the same as the <mark>borg</mark>, except they speak with a norwegian accent. to this day, the fjord and the <mark>borg</mark> remain bitter enemies, forever divided over the issue of whether or not to speak with a norwegian accent. the fjord also smell vaguely of smoked salmon, which is another reason the <mark>borg</mark> don't like them. rust kittens. the war between the <mark>borg</mark> and the planet of cute little defenseless kittens lasted about 23 seconds, after which the kittens accepted the unconditional surrender of the <mark>borg</mark> and told them to get off their planet. \"that piece of metal no-one cut off'. the piece of metal hath claimed many a <mark>borg</mark> life. their senses dont pick it up as an active threat, anyone who meets it dies before they can tell the others, and its alway catching the excess tubing coming out of their heads. species 8472. for no reason at all, those guys can anal the <mark>borg</mark> in less than half a second. rabbids can't be assimilated into the <mark>borg</mark>. but. they. can. dance! computer viruses, which make the <mark>borg</mark> freeze, reboot, delete files and play nsfw movies at inappropriate times. the kazon. of only one reason; the <mark>borg</mark> wants to be perfect, and the kazon are so stupid that even one assimillated kazon would ruin all the work they've done for eternity, plus drones need to be bald, and its a known fact that kazon hair is indestructible. why else do you think the kazon have the shittiest hairdos in the galaxy? cybermen. they are angry that the <mark>borg</mark> stole their shtick. technically they cant be angry, but you get the picture. jehovah's witnesses. they just won't leave the borgs alone. fighting the <mark>borg</mark> sophia is coming for you. after the destruction of the <mark>borg</mark> queen's vessel, the <mark>borg</mark> where forced to influence alies, like the ottoman empire in the 19th century. the <mark>borg</mark> are virtually unstoppable killing machines. however, here are a few tips to help survive a <mark>borg</mark> attack. get the all invincible crew of voyager to kill them for you. if you can, run, although the <mark>borg</mark> ships are capable of moving at incredible speeds. install a sexually transmitted computer virus into data and make him rape the <mark>borg</mark>. use photon torpedoes. and quantum torpedoes. and transphasic torpedoes. and chroniton torpedoes. use your phasers, rapidly shifting frequencies to stay ahead of the <mark>borg</mark>'s ability to shift their shields. the <mark>borg</mark> can rapidly adapt to your phaser fire. use unconventional means of attack such as spreading nasty rumors behind their backs to all their friends. wait...they don't have any friends. never mind. shoot them with holographic bullets from your holographic tommy gun point and laugh at their ugly face. if the <mark>borg</mark> nevertheless invade your ship, try to fit in. if the <mark>borg</mark> think you're already one of them, you won't be assimilated. dance\" the robot \". try covering yourself with aluminum foil. pull some tubing from their heads. hit them with a blunt object. they won't expect it. shine a laser pointer at their scanners. throw worf at them. ridges facing front of course. make kirk do them. put your finger on their chest, say\" you've got something on your shirt \", and when they look down, hit and run. correct their pronunciation of the word\" futile \". magnets. lots and lots of magnets. make them go to sleep. the common cold. get them to see an optical illusion. interpreting the pointless seems efficient against borgs. see philosophy. break off an extended part of their mechanical body. masturbate assimilate them. rickroll them. since they are notoriously slow-moving, just walk away. cover your eyes. the <mark>borg</mark> are notorious for thinking if you can't see them, they can't see you. just download vista into their hard drive. history the <mark>borg</mark> tried other methods of assimilation, but then the writers all wen on strike. violence was more fun anyway. <mark>borg</mark> started their career performing in low-class sundsvall pubs in exchange for beer. sideshow's real parents died in 1982 and for some reason bequeathed sideshow with a music studio in nearby france. the band then decided on a name (<mark>borg</mark>) and cut their first demo tape. the instruments were shoddily played, and the music was crap. <mark>borg</mark> sent their demo tape to all the major, minor, and produced-out-of-basement labels. somehow, their demo tape landed in the hands of <mark>kevin smith</mark>, a visionary filmmaker whose first project was 1984's footloose, an epic story of love and heartbreak in the caribbean starring ross gellar. <mark>kevin</mark> was intrigued by the raw, emotionless music and decided to include <mark>borg</mark> on the movie's soundtrack. following the release of footloose, <mark>borg</mark> skyrocketed to popularity and got their first top-40 hit with\" i wannabe assimilated \". the following year, <mark>borg</mark> produced their first album, the inimitable first contact. the tone and style of their new album was much more mainstream and accessible. the album soon went triple diamond. following the release of the album, in 1985,\" resistance is futile (give me all your love) \"hit #1 and stayed there for all 52 weeks. america, europe, and the world was in love with <mark>borg</mark>. unbeknownst to <mark>borg</mark>, an alien of blood curdling terror was watching them from its imperial starcruiser of force. the alien chose to infest the minds of <mark>borg</mark> and turn their bodies into evil, morphing, visceriods. the visceroids then mega-morphed into the current <mark>borg</mark> with the help of
