Related Content Prosecutors weigh sex assault charges against Chinese billionaire (CNN) - A high-profile Chinese human rights lawyer detained more than three years ago is facing trial Wednesday, the latest prominent detainee sent to court by the ruling Communist Party over the Christmas period. Wang Quanzhang was taken into custody in July 2015, one of more than 200 lawyers and activists detained as part of a mass crackdown on human rights defenders across China. Wang, known for his advocacy of practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement and Christians, is the last lawyer still behind bars as part of the sweep. China regularly sends high-profile detainees and dissidents to court around the Christmas period, taking advantage of the large absence of the international media and diplomatic community. Human rights activist <mark>Wu Gan</mark> was sentenced to eight years in prison on Christmas Day in 2017, while Nobel Laureate <mark>Liu Xiaobo</mark> was imprisoned on the same day in 2009. Wang's trial began on Wednesday morning local time, and is being held behind closed doors due to the nature of the charges. It isn't clear how long the trial will last or when the final sentence will be handed down. Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, has been campaigning relentlessly for his release ever since her husband's detention. In April she marched from Beijing to Tianjin on foot to \"find her husband.\" She was one of four spouses of high-profile human rights lawyers who protested against their detention in front of the Supreme People's Court on December 17, publicly shaving their heads in protest as the word \"hairlessness\" sounds similar to \"lawlessness\" in Chinese. Due to the tight control of China's authoritarian government and harsh penalties for protesting, public demonstrations in China over politically sensitive topics are rare. After security guards stopped her from presenting a letter petitioning for her husband, Li said judges had behaved in a \"lawless\" manner around Wang's trial. \"It has been almost two years since the case of Wang Quanzhang was filed to the court, but the judges in charge of this case have been avoiding meeting us, and our lawyer is not allowed to see the court paper,\" she said at the protest. \"This case has been endlessly delayed...so I came here today to ask the Supreme Court to fulfill its responsibility of supervising and to correct the subordinate court's unlawful behaviors.\" Li was also visited by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during her last visit to China in May.

Uber UBER, -0.35% reported first-quarter losses of $1.01 billion, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of $3.1 billion. Shares gained about 1% in after-hours trading immediately following the report, then fell to a loss of about 1%, then continued to bounce around between slight gains and losses. The stock has yet to touch its IPO price of $45 a share in regular trading since the first trading day on May 10. Uber disclosed ahead of the IPO that it expected to lose at least $1 billion and up to $1.11 billion in the first quarter, on net revenue of $3.04 billion to $3.1 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Uber reported massive earnings of $3.75 billion on revenue of $2.58 billion, though that outsize profit was linked to the sale of some of its international operations, with a stated operational loss of about half a billion dollars in the year-ago quarter. \"Our Q1 2019 results were at or near the high end of the ranges we shared last month in our IPO prospectus,\" Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said in a statement. \"Our investments remain focused on global platform expansion and long-term product and technology differentiation, but we will not hesitate to invest to defend our market position globally.\" Not enough analysts projected Uber's first-quarter earnings to form a solid consensus for this report. Analysts for banks that underwrite an initial public offering tend to wait 25 days from the offering before initiating coverage of a stock, and most of Wall Street helped out on Uber's IPO, which listed an astounding 29 banks as underwriters. Expect a wave of Uber initiations next week with analysts' thoughts on this earnings report. Uber reported bookings--which represents the total amount of money spent on the Uber platform, instead of just the part that Uber takes and is counted as revenue--of $14.65 billion, up from $10.9 billion a year ago. Uber said in its pre-IPO disclosure that it expected gross bookings of $14.44 billion to $14.66 billion, with about 78% of that total attributed to its ride-sharing platform and most of the rest coming from the Uber Eats food-delivery business. Uber lived up to its forecast with ride-hailing bookings of $11.45 billion and Uber Eats bookings of $3.07 billion in the first quarter, with the rest credited to the company's \"Other Bets\" ventures. Uber Eats bookings more than doubled from a year ago, increasing 108%, while ride-hailing increased about 22%. Rival Lyft Inc.. LYFT, -2.54% stopped disclosing bookings information in its first earnings report after its earlier IPO, despite providing the information in pre-IPO filings. Chief Financial Officer <mark>Brian Roberts</mark> said at the time that Lyft \"really wanted to try to avoid investor confusion\" in not providing the information. More: Lyft stops providing key data after IPO, then insults investors' intelligence The revenue breakdown was roughly similar to bookings. Uber said that about 76.7% of revenue came from ride-hailing, and 17.3% from Uber Eats, with the rest credited to Other Bets and \"Vehicle Solutions.\" Uber did not provide a forecast for the second quarter in its announcement. A conference call with executives was scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Uber stock closed Thursday with a 0.4% loss at $39.76. Jeremy C.

AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu National Transportation Safety Board Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart speaks in a press conference on the crash of SpaceShipTwo on Saturday, Mojave, California. The explosion killed a pilot aboard and seriously injured another while scattering wreckage in Southern California's Mojave Desert, witnesses and officials said. WASHINGTON, D.C. - Fiery failures are no stranger to the space game. It's what happens when you push the boundaries of what technology can do, where people can go. And it happened again to Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. In the past decade, the space industry has tried to go from risky and government-run to routine private enterprise - so routine that if you have lots of money you can buy a ticket on a private spaceship and become a space tourist. More than 500 people have booked a flight, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and little known space scientist Alan Stern. But it all depends on flying becoming safe and routine. This week hasn't helped. Three days after a private unmanned rocket taking cargo up to the International Space Station blew up six seconds into its flight, a test flight of SpaceShipTwo exploded Friday over the Mojave Desert with two people on board. The developments reignited the debate about the role of business in space and whether it is or will ever be safe enough for everyday people looking for an expensive 50-mile-high thrill ride. \"It's a real setback to the idea that lots of people are going to be taking joyrides into the fringes of outer space any time soon,\" said John Logsdon, retired space policy director at George Washington University. \"There were a lot of people who believed that the technology to carry people is safely at hand.\" The question for space tourism might be, \"if it survives,\" Logsdon said. But he thinks its momentum in recent years will keep it alive. Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson expressed the same view Saturday after arriving in Mojave, California, to meet with the project workforce reeling from the accident. \"We would love to finish what was started some years ago, and I think pretty well all our astronauts would love us to finish it, love to go to space,\" he said. \"Millions of people in the world would love to one day have the chance to go to space.\" Federal estimates of the commercial space industry - only a little of it involving tourism - exceed $200 billion. NASA is counting on private companies such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences to haul cargo to the space station. They are also spending billions to help SpaceX and Boeing build ships that will eventually take people there, too. Internet pioneers Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have gotten into the space game. Aviation entrepreneur Branson and others are pushing a billion-dollar space tourism industry. The Virgin Galactic and Orbital accidents have nothing in common except the words private space, Stern said. Still it raises issues about the space industry. Some experts said they worry that private industry may just not be as safe as the government when it comes to going into space. Jerry Linenger, a former astronaut who narrowly survived a 1997 fire on the Russian space station Mir, said private industry lacks the experience and the advocates for safety that NASA had when he was launching into space. He pointed to former moonwalking astronaut <mark>John Young</mark>, who NASA encouraged to raise safety issues and slow things down. Watching the Orbital Sciences accident on Tuesday, Linenger said, \"it was blatantly obvious that it is a dangerous operation that is very nearly on the edge,\" yet private companies talk of doing it better, faster and cheaper. Then they find out that was naive, he said. American University space policy professor Howard McCurdy, who wrote the book \"Space and the American Imagination,\" said NASA in the 1990s and private companies tout lean management to get things done faster, better and cheaper in space. But he said that leaves no margin for error and \"is like flying an airplane without a qualified pilot. You really need to do it right.\" McCurdy pointed to all the Silicon Valley whiz kids in space and worried that they come with the same Microsoft attitude of pushing a product out and fixing it on the fly. \"I'm not sure that works for rocket ships,\" McCurdy said. \"That may work for cellphones, smartphones and computer programs.\" With space, he said, \"you're working much closer to the edge.\" Logsdon said he wouldn't fly on commercial space flights now, but Virgin Galactic customer Alan Stern said he had no qualms about it: \"Let's not be Chicken Littles,\" he said. He recalled the early days of aviation or the early days of jet test piloting in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, when people died pushing the boundaries of technology. McCurdy said the private space industry seems to be having the same growing pains and failures that NASA and the military had when the first astronauts watched a rocket blow up in front of them. It seemed that in the first five years of U.S. rockets, one blew up every other week, but it wasn't quite that bad, said Roger Launius, associate director of the National Air and Space Museum. This week seems a lot like those old times, he said. Launius wonders if the public will support private efforts despite the visible failures, and can the for-profit companies tolerate the risk that comes with space and accidents. Orbital's stock price has dropped 13 percent since Tuesday's accident. \"I want to be part of the opening of this future frontier,\" the former associate administrator of NASA said. \"I want to make that better future a reality.\" No frontier has been one without the risk of life and limb, \"he added.\" I stand with the brave pioneers of space who do this for all mankind. \"Seth Borenstein can be followed at http: //twitter.com/borenbears Aiken Standard is pleased to offer readers the enhanced ability to comment on stories.

(Dede Smith/The Florida Times-Union via AP) Dede Smith JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)--Hurricane Irma's devastating storm surge came with weird twists that scientists attribute to the storm's girth, path and some geographic quirks. A combination of storm surge, heavy rains and swollen rivers sent some of the worst flooding into Jacksonville, Florida, even though Irma roared into the opposite end of the state, had weakened to a tropical storm and its eye stayed at least 80 miles (130 kilometers) away. Although preliminary data suggest Irma's eye pushed a surge of more than 10 feet (3 meters) onto southwest Florida's Marco Island, the highest water levels were reported hundreds of miles away in Jacksonville and Savannah, Georgia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And southwestern Florida, which is prone to surges, saw the opposite at first: a strange-looking negative surge that sucked the water off the sea floor quickly enough to maroon several manatees. After the water pulled away from the beaches and bay, it came back with vengeance, but much of Florida's west coast wasn't swamped as badly as it could have been because Irma's track kept them safe from the storm's stronger eastern side. \"You can call it bizarre; I might call it unusual or unique,\" said Rick Luettich, director of the Institute of Marine Studies at the University of North Carolina. \"What was very unusual about it was, it spanned two coastlines that were in different-facing directions. As a result, you got the opposite behavior on both coastlines.\" Tampa \"dodged a bullet\" on the weaker side of the storm, especially because Irma's southwestern eyewall had been broken up by high winds near Cuba, MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel said. Jacksonville and the rest of the east coast, on the other hand, got the northeast brunt of the storm, where winds, surge and rainfall are at the strongest. And because hurricane winds spin counterclockwise and lined up perfectly perpendicular to Jacksonville's St. John's River, \"it just pushed the water from the Atlantic right into the river,\" National Hurricane Center spokesman and meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. The city's concave coastline and the shallow water off the beach also made for a bigger storm surge buildup, funneling more water into Jacksonville, said storm surge expert Hal Needham of Galveston, Texas. On top of that, Jacksonville--unlike western Florida--only got one side of Irma, so the wind kept coming from the same direction, pushing the surge even higher, Needham said. That's why <mark>Paul Johnson</mark> was surprised when Monday morning he woke up in Jacksonville, looked out the window and saw boats passing by where cars normally drive. The water was licking at his front door. Before long, the flooding rose nearly to the window of his beloved pickup truck. \"I've lived here most of my life, and I've never seen anything like that,\" he said. It was worse than last year's Category 5 Matthew, which sat just off shore, because Irma grew to an immense 415 miles (670 kilometers) wide, Luettich said. \"The size of the storm made a huge difference,\" Luettich said. People tend to focus on top sustained winds, but that's only part of the equation that goes into storm surges. The storm's size is another major factor, as with Katrina, said Jamie Rhome, who heads the storm surge unit at the National Hurricane Center. \"As bad as it felt on the east coast of Florida, things were significantly worse in the Florida Keys,\" Rhome said, as well as in the lower part of southwest Florida where the storm's eye passed close by, such as Immokalee. Negative storm surge happened where Irma's eye moved over water east of the coastline and winds pushed the water away from the shore. That draining of the bay and coast \"tricks people,\" Rhome said, but Needham said the Tampa region has experienced this type of negative storm surge at least twice before. And because the reverse surge means the coastline must be refilled before water inundates land, the resulting speed and effect of the surge is lessened, Luettich said. <mark>Johnson</mark> said he had joked with his Facebook friends when Irma's track appeared to turn away from Jacksonville that the storm was too afraid to come near. But this storm's punch came from so far away that it never had to. \"She got us back,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said. \"She showed us, she sure did.\" ---- --"}, {"articleID": "2019052714_00180198_W", "names": {"Will Smith": ["Q16981006", "Q20727796", "Q24678701", "Q3568301", "Q3568303", "Q40096", "Q51226643", "Q56528891", "Q8003105", "Q8003106", "Q8003108"], "Robin Williams": ["Q16853353", "Q27252", "Q28835708", "Q42954305", "Q7352873", "Q7352874", "Q83338"], "Ian Mcshane": ["Q234141", "Q59149806", "Q5982372"], "Chris Evans": ["Q17490263", "Q178348", "Q21538587", "Q23418578", "Q27918241", "Q2964709", "Q2964710", "Q303577", "Q466583", "Q5106513", "Q51990270", "Q5392352"], "Bradley Cooper": ["Q205707", "Q4954898"], "Ryan Reynolds": ["Q192682", "Q7384463"], "Justice Smith": ["Q22058479", "Q6186853"], "Elizabeth Banks": ["Q219373", "Q47295776"]}, "date": "2019-05-27", "url": "https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2019/05/27/1921358/disneys-live-action-aladdin-casts-box-office-spell", "content": "Disney's live-action \"Aladdin' casts a box-office spell (Agence France-Presse) - May 27, 2019 - 7:33 pm HOLLYWOOD--\"Aladdin\" apparently still has the old magic, as the new Disney film took in an estimated $86.1 million in the Friday-to-Sunday period in North America to lead all box-office offerings, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported. The film, released on the US's four-day Memorial Day weekend, is expected to earn $105 million when Monday's ticket sales are included, well beyond earlier estimates of around $80 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The live-action movie, directed by Guy Ritchie, stars <mark>Will Smith</mark> as the genie and the Egyptian-born Canadian actor Mena Massoud as the wily charmer who pretends to be a prince to catch the attention of the lovely Jasmine (Naomi Scott). The new version is an adaptation of Disney's 1992 \"Aladdin,\" which featured the unforgettable voice of <mark>Robin Williams</mark> as the fast-talking genie (and the less well-known actor Scott Weinger as Aladdin). Last week's box-office leader, Lionsgate's \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" slipped to second, taking in $24.4 million for three days ($30.5 million for four). Keanu Reaves again stars as retired hitman John Wick, this time being chased by an army of killers after a contract is put on his head. Also starring are Halle Berry, Laurence Fishburne, <mark>Ian McShane</mark> and Anjelica Huston. In third was Disney blockbuster \"Avengers: Endgame,\" taking in an estimated $16.8 million for three days ($21.9 million for four). \"Avengers,\" with an all-star cast including Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, <mark>Chris Evans</mark>, Chris Hemsworth, <mark>Bradley Cooper</mark>, Scarlett Johansson and Josh Brolin, has broken domestic records but, with a worldwide take of $2.68 billion, is still shy of the $2.79 billion earned by all-time leader \"Avatar\" in 2009. Fourth place went to Warner Bros.' \"Pokemon: Detective Pikachu,\" at $13.3 million ($17 million). Its animated title character (voiced by <mark>Ryan Reynolds</mark>) teams up with a young boy (<mark>Justice Smith</mark>, in a live-action role) to seek the boy's missing father. And in fifth was new Sony horror thriller \"Brightburn,\" at $7.5 million ($9 million). <mark>Elizabeth Banks</mark>, David Denman and Jackson A. Dunn star in the story of an alien tot who arrives on Earth and realizes, as he grows up on a Kansas farm, that he has superpowers.
