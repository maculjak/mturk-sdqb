like the hot and sticky weather he sometimes reports on, lansing meteorologist jake dunne uses his concise and easygoing storytelling ability to grab the reader in \"stand by,\" his new mystery-thriller. dunne's follow-up to his 2008 \"johnstone junction\" picks up on denver weatherman <mark>sam stone</mark>, a year and a half after the amateur detective was called on to solve a mystery. this time, <mark>stone</mark> is pulled into a missing-person case when <mark>julie anderson</mark>, an anchorwoman at his previous tv station disappears without a trace while on the way to work. \"<mark>sam</mark> has the answer - he just doesn't know it,\" dunne said. he also said that in-depth readers might be able solve the mystery: \"clues to the ending of the book are sprinkled throughout, but no one has solved it yet .\" as in the first book, weather plays a major role in the plot, and dunne said his writing career is a natural outgrowth of his day job. \"i tell many stories every day,\" he said. \"some are a minute. some are three minutes .\" he said he likens his writing to john grisham and calls his style \"simple yet sarcastic .\" since the weather in michigan is so notoriously unpredictable, many readers will understand how dunne has slipped so easily into writing fiction. the wlns-tv morning meteorologist has now logged nearly seven years in lansing after moving to michigan from casper, wyo. dunne is a geosciences graduate of the other msu - mississippi state university. he said growing up in wichita, kan., with its crazy weather patterns attracted him to reporting on the weather. much of his new book is set in his hometown. dunne also likes to make it clear that although his book includes \"some true stories\" that he is not <mark>dan stone</mark>. however, some of that may change in his next <mark>dan stone</mark> mystery, which is set in michigan. that's all he'll say about his next book. dunne, who squeezes in time for writing here and there in his busy schedule - he's up at 1:30 a.m., getting ready to go to work - has come to grips with the understanding that \"writing is a full-time job .\" he said sales of his new book have exceeded his expectations. \"we'll see where it goes,\" he added. contact us? 2009 city pulse city pulse. 2001 e. michigan ave. lansing, mi 48912.", "articleID": "2012053016_00026556_W", "names": {"Sam Stone":

mccain were running for president? president barack obama seems to think so. in a case of strange bedfellows in american politics, obama and his re-election advisers are waxing nostalgic for the man the president defeated last time around. they're embracing mccain as a reasonable voice on climate change and immigration, someone who took on extremism in his own party. it's all a way of drawing a contrast with obama's current republican presidential opponent, mitt romney, and trying to convince crucial independent voters that the gop challenger is outside the mainstream. but the president's flattering memories of mccain conflict with their campaign clashes of 2008. back then, obama hammered his rival as \"out of touch\" with many of the problems facing americans. and the platitudes of today conceal the reality of obama's current dynamic with mccain. the arizona republican remains one of the president's staunchest critics on everything from health care to foreign policy. he's also a vocal romney supporter. to hear obama tell it now, the mccain who ran against him in 2008 was an example of a principled republican who knew how to reach across the aisle. the implication from obama is that those qualities simply don't apply to romney. \"john mccain believed in climate change,\" obama told supporters at a fundraiser in minneapolis friday. \"john believed in campaign finance reform. he believed in immigration reform. i mean, there were some areas where you saw some overlap. in this election, the republican party has moved in a fundamentally different direction .\" obama's riff on mccain has become a standard part of his fundraising appeal to donors. and as the general election heats up, the obama campaign is relishing more opportunities to try to turn its former foe into an asset. when romney didn't condemn his supporter <mark>donald trump</mark> for raising more questions this week about the president's citizenship, the obama campaign dug up old video clips of mccain correcting supporters in the 2008 who said they were scared of obama and one clip of a supporter who thought he was an \"arab .\" \"as the republican nominee, john mccain stood up to the voices of extremism in his party,\" an obama internet video says. it then asks why romney won't do the same. the 90-second video ends with words on the screen that read: \"mccain and romney: two republican nominees, only one willing to lead .\" <mark>brian rogers</mark>, a spokesman for mccain, said friday that if mccain and obama \"share so many priorities and are in such agreement, why didn't the president or his staff ever reach out to senator mccain to work on them?\" not surprisingly, veterans of the 2008 campaign are split down party lines over whether the 2012 obama campaign's strategic embrace of its former rival makes sense. \"they're not announcing that they're embracing all of (mccain's) positions on issues,\" said jennifer psaki, a former obama white house official who also worked on the president's 2008 campaign. \"but they are highlighting the standards that john mccain held himself to that mitt romney has not .\" <mark>steve schmidt</mark>, a senior strategist to mccain's 2008 campaign, said voters will see through the obama team's attempts to use the former gop nominee to paint the party's current standard-bearer as an extremist. \"it's very difficult to make the case that mitt romney is a right-wing nut, particularly because a lot of real right-wing nuts have spent a lot of time saying romney's not one of them,\" <mark>schmidt</mark> said. like romney, mccain faced criticism from democrats in 2008 who said the independent-minded senator had kowtowed to the conservative wing of the party in order to claim the gop nomination. the nearly four years since obama and mccain's electoral face-off have been filled with interactions that the president probably won't be bringing up at campaign fundraisers or using in a campaign video. in a meeting during the 2010 health care debate, mccain criticized how democrats were constructing the legislation. obama cut him off, saying \"we're not campaigning anymore. the election is over .\" mccain responded: \"i'm reminded of that every day .\" the longtime arizona senator has also been one of the harshest critics of the president on foreign policy matters, often arguing that the president is being too passive. in recent days, mccain said it was \"embarrassing\" that the united states wasn't doing more to stem the bloodshed in syria. the obama and mccain conflicts aside, <mark>schmidt</mark> said he's not surprised to see his former boss back in the electoral mix: \"the last guy is never more popular than after there's a new guy .\" ", "articleID":

prime minister <mark>gordon brown</mark> on monday accused a rupert murdoch-owned tabloid of personally attacking him, failing the british people and undermining the war in afghanistan through its coverage of the conflict. in an often bitter attack on the murdoch press in testimony to britain's media ethics inquiry, <mark>brown</mark> directly contradicted murdoch's claim that the then-prime minister had made an abusive phone call to the media mogul in 2009. murdoch told the inquiry last month that <mark>brown</mark> had vowed to \"make war on your company\" after the sun switched its support to the conservatives. \"it didn't happen,\" said <mark>brown</mark>, adding that he had been shocked to hear murdoch make the allegation under oath. murdoch's news international fired back, saying in a statement that the mogul stood by his testimony. <mark>brown</mark> is the first in a string of current and former political leaders to appear this week at the inquiry, set up amid a tabloid phone hacking scandal to examine malpractice in the media and ties among politicians, police and the press. among the issues the inquiry is addressing is whether newspapers have too much power over the political agenda. <mark>brown</mark> told the judge-led inquiry that the sun newspaper was guilty of \"the conflation of fact and opinion\" in its coverage of the afghanistan conflict and of his premiership. he said that instead of covering the difficult decisions facing his government, the sun had concluded \"that i personally did not care about our troops in afghanistan .\" he said the newspaper had made a series of spurious claims, for example that he had fallen asleep during a service of remembrance for dead troops. <mark>brown</mark> said he had been bowing his head in prayer. <mark>brown</mark> asserted that the sun's coverage had done \"huge damage\" to the war effort. the former prime minister said the press had \"failed this country\" by focusing on opinions and ephemera when the war in afghanistan was at a crucial stage. \"i'm afraid half the country (afghanistan) is falling into the hands of the taliban,\" <mark>brown</mark> said, accusing the press of failing to reflect this. the sun's political editor, tom newton dunn, denied <mark>brown</mark>'s allegations, saying on twitter that the newspaper had given the conflict prominent coverage. \"military loathed <mark>brown</mark> because they felt he didn't care about them. sun reported that, but <mark>gordon</mark> rewrites history to shoot the messenger,\" he tweeted. <mark>brown</mark> had a testy relationship with the powerful murdoch press during his 2007-2010 term in office. the sun, renowned for its political clout, backed the conservative party over <mark>brown</mark>'s labour in the 2010 national election. the election ejected <mark>brown</mark> from power and produced a conservative-liberal democrat coalition government. two years on, <mark>brown</mark> appeared bruised by his relationship with a press that often characterized him as prickly and awkward. <mark>brown</mark> also spoke of his pain at seeing leaked details of his young son's health splashed in the tabloid. the sun revealed in 2006 that <mark>brown</mark>'s infant son fraser had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. <mark>brown</mark> said he and his wife sarah had been distressed by the leak? which apparently came from a hospital worker? but acknowledged that sarah had remained friendly with rebekah brooks, the sun's then-editor, and even organized a 40th birthday party for her in 2008. \"i think sarah is one of the most forgiving people i know,\" <mark>brown</mark> said. \"i think she finds the good in everyone .\" brooks, 44, along with her husband and four aides, was charged last month with conspiring to pervert the course of justice in connection with the phone hacking scandal. they are the first people to be charged in the current investigation into tabloid wrongdoing, which has shaken britain's media, police and political establishments. more than 40 people have been arrested and questioned. the ethics inquiry was set up last year after revelations that the now-defunct news of the world had hacked the mobile phone voice mails of scores of celebrities, politicians and even crime victims in its quest for scoops. britain's current treasury chief, <mark>george osborne</mark>, testified later monday about his relationship with murdoch's media empire. prime minister <mark>david cameron</mark> faces questioning on thursday. <mark>osborne</mark> spent the early part of his testimony answering questions about his relationship to the murdoch family. he is also likely to be quizzed about his role in hiring a former editor of murdoch's scandal-tarred tabloid news of the world, andy coulson, as communications chief for the conservative party. after <mark>cameron</mark> became prime minister, coulson served as downing st. communications chief before resigning because of the scandal. ___ jill lawless can be reached at: subscribe to this comment thread by email cancel the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. by
