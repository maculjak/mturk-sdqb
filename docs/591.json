In the initial trends, Singh was leading by 194 votes, but <mark>Khan</mark> later took a huge lead and till the end of the counting retained the lead and won it with a huge margin. The city's Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar fall under the Okhla constituency. Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of protest against the Citizenship (Amendment Act) as women with young children have been on a sit-in protest there for nearly two months. \"It is the victory of all of us. We all elected Amanat bhai (Amanatullah Khan) as our leader. He has helped the women and youth of this area in every sphere, that is, from health to education, infrastructure to jobs. He got many youth from this area employed,\" Shamima Bano from Shaheen Bagh said. Women protesters erupted in joy with loud rounds of applause as they hugged each other. \"The AAP truly brought development to an aam aadmi (common man). My kids go to a nearby Government school. We all go to the AAP government's Mohalla clinic for treatment. My mother-in-law is being treated for her knee problem since four years,\" Mehjabeen Qureshi said at the protest site. \"AAP understands the needs of its citizens,\" she added. There was also a wave of excitement in Batla House, Noor Nagar, Abu Fazal Enclave, Zakir Nagar and the adjoining areas when the news of the AAP winning big emerged. <mark>Asim Khan</mark>, a garment dealer said, \"We have seen Jamia Nagar change in the last five years. We voted for AAP's honesty and transparent policies. Not only Jamia Nagar, the entire Delhi voted for real\" vikas' (development) which is Arvind Kejriwal \". Sharvari (75) of Shaheen Bagh said,\" Amanatullah is like our son and his victory is not by chance. The AAP has understood the pulse of Delhi. Today we want to distribute \"biryani' to all those politicians who called our protest politically motivated and accused us of eating sponsored Biryani .\" The elections in the national capital took place in the midst of massive protests in the city and elsewhere over the new citizenship law, an issue which was strongly raised by the BJP top leadership during the campaigning which often turned bitter and vitriolic.

I have been playing a lot of hockey, which I really like .\" Justin and Hailey were first married in a secret ceremony in New York in September 2018, but exchanged vows for the second time in South Carolina in October.

Dressed in jeans, a black sweater and orange beanie, Bieber celebrated the imminent release of his fifth album Changes by performing a five-song set backed by two acoustic guitarists. Justin Bieber in London ahead of the concert (Yui Mok/PA) He paid tribute to Hailey, saying: \"I'm telling you, being married is so awesome. But don't get it twisted, marriage is not easy .\" It is something you have got to work for. If marriage was easy everybody would just do it really fast. \"If you guys want to be serious and get married just know it is not just something...It takes work .\" Every day you have to love that person, be kind to that person.

Daniel Acke / Bloomberg via Getty Images Democrats could avoid another tech meltdown like the one that afflicted the Iowa caucuses with a better strategy for building the tools they need, progressive technology specialists say. The origins of the Iowa debacle are in a boom-and-bust cycle that places technology in competition with other priorities as time-crunched campaigns grapple with how best to spend as they hurtle toward an election. \"The easy way to spend money, that's reliable, is on advertising,\" says Evan Henshaw-Plath, a technologist who has built applications for progressive causes and was an early employee at Twitter. \"Spending money on technology is riskier and may or may not pay off .\" When campaigns commence, they hire staff, open offices, buy ads. When the campaign ends, the contracts end and the offices close. Code that is written is often abandoned and forgotten. \"We're rebuilding everything from scratch each cycle for everything that isn't finance and compliance,\" Henshaw-Plath says. \"We aren't funding organizations that can survive from one cycle to the next,\" he adds. \"We aren't funding the technology to be maintained from one cycle to the next. And we aren't releasing the code in a maintainable way and picking up again on the next cycle .\" Light falls on Shadow After the Iowa caucus, the spotlight swung to Shadow, the small tech company that built the glitchy application precinct chairs were supposed to use to report results. Shadow's primary business is operating two applications for the progressive movement: a messaging product and a data integration tool. The caucus app's lackluster performance brought scrutiny of the connections between Shadow, its main investor Acroynm, and various figures and campaigns in the Democratic Party. Such connections are no surprise in this corner of the tech world: It's common practice for Democratic candidates and Democratically-aligned causes to use political tools and technologies developed specifically for the left. There are essentially separate, parallel universes of tech vendors that develop tools for either Democrats or Republicans--but not both. \"It is a pretty deeply held value within the progressive community that you want to put your money where your values are,\" says Brady Kriss, the founder and executive director of Ragtag, a company that corrals tech workers who want to volunteer their skills to help progressive causes. \"It's not just about political competition. You don't want your money in any way, directly or indirectly, to go towards supporting issues or candidates that you find morally problematic .\" Some tech experts have pointed out that popular mainstream applications like Google Forms might have been a better choice for Iowa, rather than relying on a custom-designed app built on a small budget under time pressure. Using products already in wide commercial use has another benefit: they're likely to be supported and maintained. \"If you're building on top of that, you don't have to worry about that infrastructure,\" Kriss says. \"That really helps with the cyclical nature of campaigns and campaign tech. Because it's very, very hard to keep a small application like a phone app or a large database base application updated when every other year, no one cares .\" Building beyond the campaign cycle Advocates and entrepreneurs have tried to target the boom-bust dynamic. Higher Ground Labs--a venture capital firm with the mission of supporting progressive tech companies \"for experimentation and iteration that's no longer dependent on election dates\" --was an investor in the company went on to become Shadow. But <mark>Ann Lewis</mark>, chief technology officer for MoveOn.org, says that cyclical fundraising cycles continue to affect progressive tech vendors. One particular challenge she's noticed: A lot of the money for tech arrives in September, just two months before a November election. \"That's often not enough time to really take advantage of the surge of funding in software teams,\" she says. What more money often buys is more staff--but adding engineers to a tech project only a few months before launch actually can hinder the team's speed and efficiency, <mark>Lewis</mark> says. Recurring donations can smooth out spiky funding. But when it comes to structural change, <mark>Lewis</mark> has one big request: open source software, frameworks, and collaboration spaces. Open source software means anyone can access and build on the code. The most common place for developers to share their code and collaborate is the online platform Github. If political tech developers did make more software open source, <mark>Lewis</mark> says they might be able to break free from election-driven peaks and valleys--and sustain applications long enough to make them relevant for more than one campaign cycle. \"Not all projects will be successful and not all projects will live forever. There's a constant evolution in the frameworks and tools that we use to build any kind of software,\" she says. \"But I think investing in open source early is a way to let the best software rise to the top and live past that campaign horizon .\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

The 28-year-old striker has not played since leaving the Shrimpers in January 2018. But the former Newcastle United forward is eager to come back to Blues and willing to play without being paid. \"I would love to come back to Southend and I'll play for free,\" Ranger told Echosport. \"I feel like I owe it to the fans because they've been so loyal to me .\" I've never known a player have three songs but they had that for me when I was there. \"They would sing them back-to-back and it meant a lot to me .\" I class myself as a Southend fan now myself and seeing the results coming in this season has been horrible so I want to help. \"It didn't finish properly with Southend either so I feel like I have unfinished business as well .\" The former Newcastle United striker scored 10 goals in 49 games for Blues but was regularly fined for poor timekeeping.

Business groups in Blenheim are in talks over a business hub. Photo: LDR / Chloe Ranford A report detailing the pros and cons of a business hub has been released by four of the region's business groups and the Marlborough District Council - who have christened themselves \"Marlborough Inc'. The idea was first pitched during last year's annual plan, when the Marlborough Chamber of Commerce asked the council to fund a feasibility study into a business hub. The council instead offered to run meet-ups to pinpoint how to better support local businesses. It had since held three meetings with Destination Marlborough, Marlborough Chamber of Commerce, Business Trust Marlborough and the Blenheim Business Association (BBA), the report said. Council strategic planning and economic development manager <mark>Neil Henry</mark> said the organisations had supported an investigation into possible business hub costs, and creating a more\" cohesive \"business model. But their report showed the organisations were concerned that setting up a hub would cause a loss of brand identity and independence,\" community confusion \", and difficulties over who owned the building and its data. Written under the\" cons' section were people's worries, including: \"[the] bad performance of one partner effecting all\" , \"[being] tarred with the same brush\" and \"dominant personalities winning out\". Business Trust Marlborough also queried the potential cost of renting a space in the hub, as their current lease was $285 a month. Benefits of a business hub included reductions in duplication, a potential reduction in costs, and a \"vibrant work environment\". \"[It could allow] cover while I am on holiday,\" one person wrote. Marlborough Chamber of Commerce CEO Hans Neilson pitched the idea of a business hub to the Marlborough District Council last year. Photo: LDR / Chloe Ranford <mark>Henry</mark> said a hub would also prove Marlborough was \"open for business', and could entice central government agencies to set up. The organisations noted under an\" insights' prompt that the business hub might need to be located outside Blenheim's town centre, and that moving in together could encourage a lower infrastructure footprint. <mark>Henry</mark> pointed out that a business hub was not needed to build a more cohesive business system, which the organisations were working on. The proposed system, which could be put down instead of or before a business hub's establishment, encouraged the organisations to discuss each other's services to clients and share reporting. Business Trust Marlborough manager and councillor <mark>Brian Dawson</mark>, who could not vote on the report due to conflict of interest, said to keep or scrap the business hub was a \"big decision\". He went with Marlborough Chamber of Commerce chief executive Hans Neilson to Hawkes Bay in September last year to pilfer ideas from its business hub, which covered a region, like Marlborough. \"Like all things, there's advantages and disadvantages,\" he said. Hawkes Bay's business hub was \"no doubt\" the go-to place for businesses, but there was also \"an air of very stiff competition\". \"This is fine for bigger corporations, but the smallers ones have to constantly carve out a space in a client's mind,\" <mark>Dawson</mark> said. \"All events have multiple organisations attached to them. Sponsors don't know whether to sponsor one organisation or all of them .\" <mark>Henry</mark> said the organisations would decide whether to submit a funding request to the council's 2020-21 annual plan in April, and would consider opening the meetings to others in future. Until then, they aimed to complete several \"quick wins', like streamlining event calendars to\" remove duplication \", and publishing each other's business pitch to their personal websites to\" helped present a united \"Marlborough Inc' face\" , he said in his report. The organisations would continue to meet monthly to \"improve collaboration\".
