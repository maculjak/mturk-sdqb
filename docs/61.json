but they must adapt their strategies to the country's changing markets, increased competition, and shifting government priorities. by edward tse in 2006, the ibm corporation uprooted the main offices for its global procurement services. it transferred them from somers, n.y., 20 miles north of corporate headquarters at armonk, to shenzhen in south china's pearl river delta, just across from hong kong. it was a notable moment: the first time one of ibm's most critical departments had moved its center from the united states. and it marked a significant milestone along the road toward making ibm a \"globally integrated enterprise\" running \"truly global systems of production,\" as its ceo, sam palmisano, had written in chongqing, in southwestern china, is a rapidly growing megacity with a population of more than 30 million. photograph \u00a9 qing shan/color china photo/sipa ibm's executives knew, from many years of firsthand experience, that this region in southern china had become home to one of the biggest pools of procurement talent in the world. the company had arrived in 1993, manufacturing personal computers - a business it eventually sold in 2005, to lenovo, a chinese company. over the years ibm had produced servers, retail store systems, storage devices, and printers in shenzhen: first for overseas markets, and later, increasingly for the chinese market. it had seen massive supply networks develop in the pearl river delta. some suppliers made parts for toys, sports shoes, and other low-end products; others made components for sophisticated computing and telecommunications equipment. still others provided logistics and supporting technology. ibm had also seen the chinese government invest in business-friendly infrastructure: economic zones, industrial parks, highways and container ports, universities and training colleges. by locating its global procurement headquarters in shenzhen, ibm was not only strengthening its own supply base, but better positioning one of its core businesses: helping clients strengthen their supply chains. the company has also invested in r & d in china. its china research laboratory, one of eight flagship ibm labs around the world, is located in zhongguancun software park, next to beijing's main university district. most of its more than 150 researchers hold doctorates or master's degrees from beijing, tsinghua, or other leading chinese universities. the lab specializes in speech and language technologies, cross-border e-business solutions, and pervasive computing, which is the embedding of microprocessors in everyday objects. ibm opened another lab in shanghai in 2008. in consulting, despite the global economic slowdown, ibm has been on a growth trajectory, doubling its business in 2009 because of chinese demand. it plans to open four new offices in china, taking its total presence from six to 10. moreover, ibm runs all its global growth businesses from shanghai. this includes its businesses in asia, latin america, russia, eastern europe, the middle east, and africa. in short, ibm's presence in china is very different from what might have been envisioned a few years ago. it is defined not by an expanding consumer population or by low-wage labor, but by the integration of chinese activity with its worldwide enterprise. like a growing number of other companies - coca-cola, honeywell, kfc, and goodyear among the most prominent - ibm has a \"one world\" - oriented strategy for its operations in china. in addition to sourcing products in china and seeking out chinese markets, it is investing dramatically in operations there and integrating them with the rest of ibm's global enterprise. the benefits of a one-world strategy in china have become obvious, and a growing number of multinational companies - or \"foreign\" companies, as the chinese think of them - are ready to increase their presence. they may already market to some chinese consumers, or draw from the country's labor pool, or outsource manufacturing there, but now they want more. china's rapid recovery from the global recession, bolstered by its reorganized banking sector and its emerging middle class, has attracted many companies to the chinese economy. as resources american chamber of commerce in shanghai and booz & company, \"china manufacturing competitiveness 2008-2009,\" 2009:

people would rather sweep aside, but with new legislation and greater financial penalties on the horizon, now is the time for convenience store retailers to really start getting down and dirty with their waste. the uk produces 70 million tonnes of industrial and commercial waste a year, much of which ends up festering on landfill sites. the past three years alone have seen a bin-load of new laws governing how businesses should and shouldn't be disposing of their waste, and as the problem continues to creep up the political agenda, many more are set to follow. says <mark>lee wright</mark>, marketing director of workplace equipment provider slingsby: \"moving forward, it is likely that legislation will be introduced to make recycling schemes a legal requirement in the same way that there are laws governing hazardous waste .\" the laws may be driven by environmental concerns, but there's also a financial side to landfill waste. cost per tonne soared by 25% last year and is to rise again in 2010: from april 1 all commercial organisations will have to pay \u00a3 48 for each tonne of waste they send to landfill, and this will rise by a further \u00a3 8 each year until april 2013. \"any business or other organisation, regardless of size, is being penalised financially by the government through substantially increased waste disposal costs,\" slingsby adds. fiona serrecchia, key account manager for materials recycling company cawleys, agrees: \"regulation is on its way, so smart retailers will want to get ahead of the game and implement good waste management strategies before it's too late .\" recycling is one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to reduce the amount of waste that stores send to landfill, and once you've got a good strategy in place that can be clearly followed by your staff, implementing it shouldn't be too much like hard work, says <mark>chris murphy</mark>, deputy chief executive of the chartered institution of wastes management (ciwm). in fact, most of the big professional waste management and recycling companies, such as sita uk, will conduct a free waste audit for you. they also provide educational materials, specially marked bins and legislative updates to simplify the process further. phil eccles, the national field sales manager at sita uk, says he has already seen a major change in retailers' recycling habits in the past two years. \"half of all the services we now sell are for recycling, rather than traditional waste management bins. businesses of all sizes have really been embracing the need to recycle more .\" most uk councils will also offer a competitive paid-for commercial waste collection and recycling service but the hotting up of the waste debate is prompting a burgeoning number of disposal companies to wriggle out of the woodwork, too. be warned, though, as some definitely don't smell as sweet as they sound. small waste producers such as convenience stores might not have to comply with stringent producer responsibility obligations (only businesses which handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year and have an annual turnover of \u00a3 2m need worry about those), but they do have to comply with duty of care regulations. these require businesses to: store and transport their waste appropriately and securely; keep all waste transfer notes for two years; and, most importantly, check that their waste is transported and handled by those authorised and registered to do so who won't end up fly-tipping it down a country lane. you can check if a company is a registered waste carrier by asking to see their certificate, confirming with the environment agency, or checking on the netregs waste directory website, where they should be listed. another important question to ask before employing a waste contractor is whether they will \"treat' your waste themselves, which basically means sorting, bagging or labelling it, or if you'll need to do this prior to collection. and if you don't want to end up with a mountain of card and wrappers in your backroom, don't forget to ask how often they will come to collect your waste. it's a question independent retailer chris pollard of barlby village stores in selby wishes he had asked .\" i used to use an independent recycling company to collect all the waste cardboard, but i dropped them after they started to become unreliable. the price of cardboard is incredibly volatile and when it was down the company just didn't bother turning up to collect it, leaving me with vast heaps in the garage. i now use the council's services. it costs just under \u00a3 1,000 a year, but they collect once a week without fail. \"most larger stores will have their waste collected on a daily basis, but for smaller businesses weekly collections aren't uncommon, meaning that an increasing number of retailers are also turning to technology to reduce the size of waste products ahead of collection. charles brading has recently invested in a baler to help with the cardboard recycling at his store, vic's in the isle of wight .\" after some of our bigger deliveries of 400-plus cases we can be left with a mountain of card. i don't have much space at the back of the store so the baler has been a godsend. it squashes all the cardboard into small blocks which are then collected by biffa. it's also great for getting rid of the poly shrink-wrap. i fill about six bins with it each week and the machine compresses it into a 2ft block, \"he says. chris pollard has an altogether more physical approach to the problem .\" i'm really into my recycling, but i don't use any of the high-tech gadgets and gismos to help me do it. you can achieve the same effect by getting into the bins and stamping the cardboard down. trust me, it's very effective! \"those retailers who are part of a symbol group will probably have their recycling needs taken care of, says costcutter trading manager <mark>adam walker</mark>.\" symbol group members can benefit from centrally negotiated terms with waste management companies; costcutter has terms in place with jbs waste and biffa. we also offer a full baling solution, with free collections of baled cardboard available throughout the uk. \"<mark>walker</mark> adds that epos facilities such as the group's c-pos system can also help in reducing waste by enabling retailers to better manage stock levels and eliminate over-ordering. one retailer who is taking the battle of the bins to new heights is andrew thornton. the budgens retailer is on a quest to send zero waste to landfill, and he's not far from achieving it .\" six months ago i set myself the goal of reducing the amount of waste that my two london stores sent to landfill, and today i've managed to get it down to just 6%, \"he says. all andrew's waste cardboard is collected daily by budgens for recycling. the rest is collected by independent waste management company cawleys, which uses the innovative process of anaerobic digestion (ad) to dispose of all andrew's food waste in an environmentally friendly way. food waste is broken down into fertiliser, and biogas (which is converted into electricity and heat).\" it doesn't cost me any more than it did when i used an ordinary contractor to take my waste to landfill, and this is so much better for the environment. \"but andrew's not stopping there. he plans to achieve his zero waste to landfill goal in the next few months when he launches the food cycle scheme (convenience store, february 5, p8). the initiative involves freezing food before its sell-by date and sending it to soup kitchens across the capital. and there are other ways to recycle, too. online business-to-business waste exchanges are becoming increasingly popular, and your\" waste \"cardboard boxes or crates could be of great use to your local school's art department, or to people moving house. you'd be surprised how much interest a poster in your store could generate. so

prevent protests at the funeral of a leading political prisoner, an activist said, after the death of the hunger-striking detainee sparked international outrage. cuban president raul castro \"regrets the death of cuban prisoner orlando zapata tamayo, who died yesterday after having been on a hunger strike,\" a foreign ministry statement said. but castro denied allegations of repression in the americas' only one-party communist regime after the late dissident's mother charged her son was tortured. \"there are no tortured people, there were no tortured people, there was no execution,\" raul castro, 78, told reporters. \"that is what happens at (the us naval base in) guantanamo .\" the government's initial reaction however appeared to be to move swiftly against other dissidents. elizardo sanchez, spokesman for the outlawed commission for human rights and national reconciliation, told afp that security agents had detained about 30 activists tuesday and wednesday. \"some also have been held in their houses, without a judicial warrant, to prevent people from going to the wake,\" he said. dissidents have been rounded up in the eastern provinces of santiago de cuba, guantanamo, las tunas and camaguey, and in the central city of placetas, sanchez said. zapata, 42, was to be buried in his hometown of banes, 830 kilometers (500 miles) east of havana, after a wake at the home of his mother. \"my son was tortured the whole time he was in prison,\" reina luisa tamayo charged in a video on the blog generacion y, run by independent journalist yoani sanchez in defiance of havana's tightly controlled state media. tamayo implored \"the international community to demand the release of the rest of (cuba's political) prisoners...so that what happened to my boy does not happen again .\" zapata's death drew international condemnation and calls for an investigation. jailed since 2003 and deemed a prisoner of conscience by amnesty international, zapata had blamed his already deteriorating health on harsh conditions inside cuba's jails. sanchez said it was the first time in nearly 40 years that a cuban opposition figure has died while on a hunger strike. zapata's death is \"bad news for the human rights movement and for the government as well,\" he said. the movement \"is not seeking martyrs,\" said oswaldo paya, leader of the christian liberation movement dissident group. zapata died \"defending the freedom, rights and dignity of all cubans,\" paya added. in washington, us state department spokesman philip crowley said zapata's death \"highlights the injustice of cuba's holding more than 200 political prisoners who should now be released without delay .\" related article: us urges cuba to free political prisoners the eu commission also voiced deep regret at zapata's death. the european union urges the cuban government \"to improve effectively the human rights situation in the country by releasing unconditionally all political prisoners,\" eu commission spokesman <mark>john clancy</mark> told afp. related article: eu \"deeply regrets' death of cuban hunger striker cuba claims it has no political prisoners; it says regime opponents are all\" mercenaries \"in the pay of the united states or right-wing cuban exiles. zapata was one of 55\" prisoners of conscience \"adopted by amnesty international in cuba, most of whom were also arrested in the 2003 government crackdown on activists seeking political change. initially given a three-year prison term, zapata saw his sentence grow to 36 years as the government piled on additional charges of\" disobedience \"and\" disorder in a penal establishment. \"amnesty international said zapata\" felt he had no other avenue available to him but to starve himself in protest is a terrible indictment of the continuing repression of political dissidents in cuba. \"hector palacios, one of 75 political prisoners convicted in 2003 and who met zapata in prison, told afp\" people are outraged, \"and that a national mourning and fasting period was being weighed.", "articleID": "2010022420_00071238_W", "names": {"John Clancy": ["Q17275274", "Q21603229", "Q39070859", "Q6226152"]}},
