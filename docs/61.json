ByThomas BoswellJuly 24 at 9:15 PM Follow @ ThomasBoswellWP Bryce Harper would appreciate it if everybody would just shut the heck up with all the well-intentioned advice and the high-baseball-IQ analysis about how to get out of his three-month slump. He doesn't want to hear about how fast his front foot does (or does not) stride, or why he flies open with his right shoulder and doesn't keep his bat through the hitting zone as long as he did last year. Harper knows he looks as if his timing is off, that he's in-between on every pitch and drips frustration. \"It's like quicksand. The harder you fight, the deeper you sink,\" said Harper, the 23-year-old reigning National League MVP who is now hitting .24 4 and is in a 5-for-45 nosedive. [Papelbon allows four runs in the ninth as Nats fall to Padres] Harper doesn't want to hear about the pitch sequences that are getting him out or the areas within the strike zone, like up-and-in, where he's done little damage and shown no power all year. If you think you know why he crushed curveballs last year, but not this, keep it to yourself. Trust Bryce on this; he's noticed. There isn't even any consolation in the hard, objective fact that he's had tough luck all year while teammates, for whom he's happy, have gotten the balls-with-eyes and the blessed bloops. \"Everybody means well, but when this guy or that person says something, it's going to get in there in your head. You remember it,\" said Harper, who was benched Sunday for a mental day of rest, before a scheduled off-day for the Nats on Monday, so that his mind could unwind. However, by the bottom of the eighth inning of a 6-6 game, the Nats had men on the corners with only one out and Harper's replacement-for-the-day, Chris Heisey due to hit. It was time to win the game, perhaps with as little as a sacrifice fly. If, for example, in that spot, you had <mark>Ken Griffey</mark>. Jr., who went into the Hall of Fame on Sunday, ready on your bench, wouldn't you use him, no matter what? But this is how badly Harper is going, and how long he has been doing so: Baker kept him out when the game was on the line. \"The only thing is, Bryce hasn't had much success against [Padres reliever Ryan] Buchter,\" Baker said. \"And he was coming off the bench cold. Heisey's a good fastball hitter. And Buchter's left-handed. Bryce hasn't had...or, for that matter, any left-hander hasn't had much success versus Buchter .\" [As trade deadline nears, Nats should go all-in on Chapman] Heisey popped out weakly in foul territory. Baker didn't pinch-hit Harper for the next man, either--strikeout-challenged <mark>Michael A. Taylor</mark>--because the Padres could simply have pitched around Harper to load the bases and get to Danny Espinosa. \"There was never the right spot,\" Baker said. For the Harper of' 15, every spot was the right spot. For the Harper of' 16, at least since April, not so much. <mark>Taylor</mark> chased a high fastball to strike out and kill the rally. The roof (and four runs) fell on Jonathan Papelbon after he'd gotten two outs in the ninth inning, and the Nats lost, 10-6. Their NL East lead remained at 4 & frac12; games as they headed on a nine-game trip. But the game ended on a sour irony as Harper actually did get in the game--after it was too late. Harper replaced Heisey--yes, Heisey--in right field in a double switch to start the ninth. In the bottom half, Harper popped out. Many things went well for Harper last season. But one of them was the presence of former manager <mark>Matt Williams</mark> as a personal day-to-day hitting collaborator. Not a technical coach. They were more mind-meld. They'd talk about the day's pitcher or what sequence to anticipate or, over and over, not to try for monster homers when 390 feet would do. <mark>Williams</mark> made his blunders and had his detractors, but he clicked with Harper. Davey Johnson and Baker both have Harper's respect as managers. But special is special, and who knows exactly why? \"The biggest thing about <mark>Matt</mark> was that he'd tell people to stay the hell away from me .\" He'll get out of his rut,' \"recalled Harper, who has, clearly, been bombarded with counsel from all directions in recent weeks .\" In baseball, it's easy to get voices from everywhere. You hear them. You can't help it. Some of it sticks there. <mark>Matt</mark> would wait until I came to him and say, \"<mark>Matt</mark>, what do you think?' He'd say,\" Well, what do you think?' Usually, I'd answer myself. It was easy. \"And now? [<mark>Aaron Barrett</mark> suffers right elbow fracture during rehab] Just as Harper would do without too much advice, he also doesn't need anybody's sympathy. He talks beside his locker about all the hits that fell in for him last year, the grounders that found holes, when he hit .330, far above any other season in his five years .\" I was able to do that last year, \"Harper said. Then, grinning again, he looks at <mark>Daniel Murphy</mark> being interviewed because he's had another great day .\" Murph's getting some of the hits I got last year, \"Harper said .\" That's why it's so good to be on a great team. We all enjoy [each other's good fortune]. I know I help this lineup. And...\"Harper pauses. Every hitter thinks they are close to the breakout. And Harper has always gotten hot again, his whole baseball life. Others might see the past 99 games; he sees the next 63 .\" October, \"he says, meaning when the totals are finally added up .\" Twenty homers, 60 RBI, \"he says with an ambiguous look. Does he mean the 20 bombs and 55 RBI he already has, or what might still be to come? For Harper, every season, and every part of that season, is just part of a larger work-in-progress that is never finished .\" No amount of production will ever be what I want. Last year wasn't enough, \"he says .\" I'm still trying to learn, still evolve. \"As just one example, in anticipating pitch sequences,\" I'm trying to work off the catcher. There's a big difference between what a young catcher calls and Yadi [Molina] or Buster [Posey] is going to call? I'll think, \"What would Yadi call in this situation to get himself out?'\" Then you have [pitchers like] Max Scherzer who calls his own game, \"Harper said .\" You try to figure out their \"book' on you. And then when they\" flip the book .' \"Harper starts remembering individual recent at-bats that almost were, but were not, what he'd hoped. That 475-foot third-deck homer last week is almost forgotten. But the pitch on Saturday night when he struck out? On that he was\" just out in front...back it up. \"The bombs and the K's, they look so different from the stands. They feel so close together in the batter's box--well, if Harper is the person in that box .\" You want to be so good. Someday, maybe I'll have all the books [on me], \"he said, half-joking as he gets his dress suit just right and his tie the way he wants it. Then it'll be,\" You got me last time. But you won't get me this time .' \"Harper heads for the Nats team bus. Who knows how he does it, but he looks as confident, as optimistic that he'll figure a way out of the quicksand, as he always does. The stat sheet says .245, but Harper walks away like his feet won't be in a quagmire, his fanny benched against a lefty, for too much longer.

Ms. Haslam, 21, of Longview, showed no emotion as three of Ronnie Joe Gammage Jr.'s relatives denounced her in victim impact statements for the Dec. 5, 2012, murder of the 27-year-old disabled Longview man. Judge Lauren Parish of 115th District Court pronounced the sentence, approving a plea bargain between the prosecution and defense. Gammage was abducted, purportedly in Gregg County, before his throat was cut and his dead body was set afire, according to Upshur County District Attorney Billy Byrd. The remains were found Dec. 19, 2012, in a rural Upshur County pasture. Ms. Haslam's plea came 24 days after Byrd had filed intent to seek the death penalty against her. During Thursday's 29-minute proceeding, he said the defense (represented by Mt. Pleasant attorney Charles Mac Cobb and Longview attorney Lance Larison) had since approached him about a plea bargain, and that Gammage's family approved it. Another defendant in the case, Daniel Paul Jones, now 21, of Longview, also received a sentence of life without parole last Oct. 30 after pleading guilty. Byrd told the Tyler Paper on Thursday that he has no idea yet when the case of the third co-defendant, 22-year-old <mark>Andrew Conrad</mark> Norwine of Arlington, will go to court, but \"we'll start working on him today .\" Byrd said he could not yet discuss the motive for Gammage's killing since Norwine's case is still pending. The capital murder indictment against Ms. Haslam alleged she killed Gammage \"by cutting or slicing his throat or neck with a knife or sharp force object\" while kidnapping him or attempting to. Under Texas law, a person is guilty of capital murder if he or she kills someone while committing another felony, such as kidnapping or attempted kidnapping. Capital murder in Texas is punishable only by lethal injection, or life imprisonment without parole. In statements at Thursday's sentencing, Gammage's brother, Jeff Ramsey, and sister, Angela Ramsey Dees, joined the victim's mother, Frankie Gammage, in harshly denouncing Ms. Haslam as the handcuffed and shackled defendant sat with her attorneys several feet away at the defense table. Ms. Gammage, referring to a nearby large color photo of the victim displayed on an easel, told Ms. Haslam to \"Look at him. .

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo) (CNSNews.com) - Marking the anniversaries of three previous rounds of NATO enlargement, Secretary of State <mark>John Kerry</mark> on Monday reaffirmed that \"NATO's door remains open\" to European aspirants that meet criteria for new members. \"The United States joins our allies in reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to any European country in a position to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership, and that can contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic area,\" he said. statement did not include the words \"Georgia\" or \"Ukraine,\" however. Past efforts by the two former Soviet states to get on a path for NATO membership were stymied by European members unwilling to anger Russia, which firmly opposes further expansion of the alliance near its borders. It was the second time in five days that the administration has sidestepped a clear opportunity to voice direct support for future NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine told a press conference in Brussels last Wednesday that neither country was \"currently on a path to NATO membership,\" and added that \"there has not been any immediate plans for expansion of NATO's membership .\" Georgia and Ukraine both applied for a NATO \"membership action plan\" (MAP) years ago, but despite strong support from Washington were turned down at a NATO summit in 2008, with opposition led by Western European members. They were told that they \"will become members\" at some future, unspecified date. Under its recently-ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine in 2010 withdrew from the process although a Western-leaning future government in Kiev may consider reviving the application. (While a crucial step, being awarded a MAP does not mean actual accession is imminent. Montenegro received one five years ago and has yet to join. Macedonia got a MAP a full 15 years ago, but Greece continues to block accession due to a drawn-out bilateral dispute over the country's name. NATO operates by consensus; objections from just member are sufficient to block an aspirant .) Obama's comment in Brussels came as a particular blow to Georgia, which has striven to prove itself a loyal ally and is among the largest non-NATO contributors to the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan (Georgia currently has more troops deployed in Afghanistan than 22 of NATO's 28 members .) One of the main hurdles to Georgia's NATO's aspirations is the existence of two breakaway regions, backed by Moscow - which virtually alone in the international community recognizes them as independent - South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Many NATO members are reluctant to accept a new member that has unresolved territorial disputes or hostile ties with a neighbor. Regional security analysts point out that that stance effectively gives Russia a veto over the process: Why would it resolve the territorial disputes if that would ease Georgia's entry into NATO - a move it strongly opposes? The NATO-Russia Council is currently suspended as a response to Russia's actions in Crimea, but the last time it met, in December, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made clear the Kremlin's ongoing opposition to any further NATO enlargement. \"As to the extension of NATO, we are convinced that it is a continuation of the old inertia logic of the Cold War era,\" he said. \"This is not only preservation of dividing lines, which we are all obliged to remove, but also moving them further to the east...nobody should undertake steps that create risks for the security of their partners .\" Since the end of the Cold War NATO has undergone three rounds of expansion in areas formerly under communist domination. The alliance this week will mark the three anniversaries: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined on March 12, 1999; Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia became members on March 29, 2004; and Albania and Croatia joined on April 1, 2009. In the face of varying levels of Russian objections, American leadership drove the expansion each time. \"No European democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from consideration, regardless of its geographic location, each being considered on its own merits,\" NATO declared at a U.S.-hosted summit in 1999. <mark>Kerry</mark> and other NATO foreign members will meet in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday for a meeting overshadowed by the Ukraine crisis. The agenda includes ways to support Ukraine - possibly by providing training and other help for its armed forces - and a review of the alliance's relations with Russia following its annexation of Crimea. The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Georgia will take part in sessions looking at the partnerships between their respective countries and NATO."}, {"articleID": "2014072415_00037325_W", "names": {"Arvind Sharma": ["Q4520621", "Q56378372"], "Dmitry Medvedev": ["Q23530", "Q47858657"]}, "date": "2014-07-24", "url": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/Russia-pressures-Ukraine-not-to-sign-European-Union-association-pact/articleshow/38937269.cms", "content": "\"If people in India can get donkeys married to get rains, why won't they call us?\" said <mark>Arvind Sharma</mark> who works for a company in field of cloud seeding.

Kiev's signing the EU deal was a bitter pill to swallow for Russia which wanted Ukraine to join its own trade bloc, and Moscow has expressed concern that it could see a flood of re-exported EU products.

Russia has frequently blocked food imports citing health concerns, sparking accusations from its partners of using trade as a political weapon. Kiev has come under mounting pressure from some quarters at home to quickly ratify the agreement although it has several months to do so. Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev warned that if Kiev ratifies the EU deal Moscow will halt its participation in three-way talks on the implementation of the deal\" and we could take unilateral measures to defend our economic interests. \"A senior Ukrainian official said Wednesday that the EU deal would be ratified by the end of August, before the next scheduled meeting in September of Ukrainian, Russian and EU experts to discuss the implementation of the agreement.

Ultimate \"Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he's playing Zero Suit Samus as his main character in\" Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate. \"\"Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate\" is a fighting game for the Nintendo Switch featuring an all-star lineup of characters from different video game franchises. The game has sold more than three million copies in the US since its December 7 release. Bounty hunter Samus Aran first debuted in \"Metroid\" (1986). Samus usually wears armor for space travel; the Zero Suit is her last defense when her armor is destroyed. With more than three million copies sold in the US in less than two weeks, \"Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate\" is one of the most popular video games of 2018 - and Nintendo can count Tesla CEO Elon Musk as one of its many players. At its core, the Super Smash Bros. series is Nintendo's love letter to video games. It's a massive crossover between historic franchises that lets players battle each other with their favorite characters. Seeing Nintendo's iconic characters duking it out side by side is the gaming equivalent of watching The Avengers assemble on screen. When a Smash fan tweeted at Musk to ask which character he was playing in the new game, Musk responded with Zero Suit Samus, the protagonist of Nintendo's Metroid series. \"Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate\" / Nintendo Samus in her power suit. \"Metroid\" introduced bounty hunter Samus Aran in 1986, but it's not until the end of the game that her face, and more notably her gender, are revealed. As a space adventurer Samus understandably spends most of her time in her power suit, which also appears in \"Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate .\" Zero Suit refers to the rare occassions where Samus is forced to fight without her suit, equipped with rocket boots and her paralyzer pistol. For dedicated players, choosing a \"main\" character to play in Smash often says something about your identity as a player. Your character dictates your strategy and also reflects your aesthetic taste. Read more: What are Elon Musk's favorite video games? In her skintight outfit, Zero Suit Samus seems ripe for objectification, but she also reflects a cool confidence with a fighting style that remains both lithe and lethal after she's been (literally) stripped of her powerful arsenal of missiles, bombs, and energy cannons. She also happens to be pretty darn good in the game. There are plenty of reasons for Musk to choose Zero Suit Samus as his favorite \"Super Smash Bros.. Ultimate\" character, and plenty of fun to be had speculating just how much he knows about the femme fatale. Musk's general love of video games is no secret, so maybe someday we'll see just how well he can smash with Samus.
