She also refused to remove herself from her client's case, which the judge postponed to Thursday. Several supporters wore a similar lapel button: Black, about the size of a silver dollar, with white letters. Attorney Jonathan MacArthur said he'll wear it again to Herndon's courtroom on Thursday. \"This is an issue about criminal justice,\" Ballou told the judge. She noted that some deputy district attorneys wear small office badge-type lapel pins, and that uniformed court officers are allowed to wear symbolic black bands on their badges to mourn police officers killed on duty.

Herndon, who earlier asked court spectators to cover T-shirts they'd worn to support victims in another case, told Ballou he tries to keep his courtroom free of outside influences. The pin, the judge said, \"is making a political statement, that,' I wear this in protest of how the court is treating minority defendants .'\" \"Wear it in the hallway. Wear it in front of the courthouse,\" Herndon added. \"Demonstrate. Protest. Use your voice. But that's not what dealing with justice on an individual case is about .\" Ballou, a self-described \"middle-aged, middle-income\" woman, said she feared for her life when she was surrounded by four Nevada Highway Patrol officers during a traffic stop for a driving infraction last July 4. \"People are getting killed in the streets every day.

It is a protest against police brutality .\" She said she was moved to wear the pin after hearing about the police union letter, amid a backdrop of high-profile police shootings of black men across that have ignited protests and a national dialogue about race in America.

(ig farben built 300 concentration camps, made money off of slave labor and produced zyclon b and cyanide). after the holocaust, the german chemical firm joined with american counterparts in the development of chemical warfare agents and founded the \"chemagrow corporation\" in kansas city, missouri, a front that employed german and american specialists on behalf of the u.s. army chemical corps. \"ig farben was never shut down, even though the prosecuting attorney at the nuremberg trial said ig farben should be tried for war crimes and if we did not stop them they would continue criminal activities. it broke into 3 companies: german multinationals bayer, basf and hoechst, the i.g. farben cartel was founded with a total number of employees surpassing 80,000. the race for global control was on. hoechst and bayer, the largest and third largest companies in world pharmaceutical sales respectively, are descended from i.g. farben. in september 1955, hoechst appointed friedrich jaehne, a convicted war criminal from the nuremberg trials, as chairman of its supervisory board. also, a year later, bayer appointed fitz ter meer, another convicted war criminal, as chairman of its board. so the quick rundown is this...reated superpesticides that are killing our bees which is a form of population control because people will die from starvation. germany has had it with them and is doing a smackdown right now! basf tried to make it illegal to buy or sell vitamins and herbs and got slapped with the biggest lawsuit in the history of the vitamin/herb industry. hoeshst has a subsidiary called roche that has produced the avian flu vaccine.

We have no idea how many people were in that building that night...We're expecting the worst and hoping for the best in regards to how many more victims we find .\" The fire in Oakland, near San Francisco, broke out late Friday at the cluttered warehouse where artists and students worked and lived, even though the structure wasn't licensed for such use. The electronic dance music party, with between 50 and 100 guests, also took place without proper permits. The cause of the blaze was still under investigation but Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the district attorney had activated a criminal investigation as a precaution to preserve options as the case unfolded. Authorities on Sunday asked relatives of the missing to \"eliminate future delays\" in identifying victims by preserving items like hairbrushes and toothbrushes for DNA samples. \"We will ask for them as we need them,\" said Captain Melanie Ditzenberger of the sheriff's department coroner's bureau. Firefighters worked for 12 hours by night to enter the building, eventually breaching a wall to clear their way into the warehouse, said Oakland Fire Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton .--\"A few more days'--\"It will take a few more days just getting through the building,\" Drayton told reporters. Images published online show artwork, pianos and wooden objects throughout the building, which helps explain how the fire quickly spread through the structure. \"It was filled end-to-end with furniture, whatnot, collections,\" Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said Saturday. \"It was like a maze, almost .\" \"There wasn't a real entry or exit path,\" she said. In addition, firefighters said the building seemed to have no sprinklers or smoke detectors. Officials said the roof collapsed onto the second floor, which was connected to the ground floor only by a makeshift system of wooden pallets. A dozen bodies were found in an area in the middle of the building, Drayton said. She added that the firefighters had taken every precaution to treat the human remains with respect .--\"It was heartbreaking'--Describing the atmosphere during the night of excavation, Drayton choked back tears:\" It was quiet. It was heartbreaking. \"Most of those who perished in the blaze, which started at about 11:30 pm Friday (0730 GMT Saturday) were thought to have died on the upper floor of the warehouse known as the Oakland Ghost Ship, Reed said. Some of the missing were apparently foreign students thought to be in their 20s and 30s, making identification more difficult. The fire was the deadliest incident in Oakland since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in northern California, which killed 63 people. The deadliest nightclub fire in the United States in recent decades occurred in 2003, when pyrotechnic effects by the rock band Great White set off an inferno at The Station nightclub in Rhode Island, killing 100 people.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) Posted: Friday, September 23, 2016 7:01 am OXFORD, Miss. (AP)--Georgia first-year coach Kirby Smart gets a second crack at trying to slow down Mississippi quarterback Chad Kelly. He knows from experience it won't be easy. \"He's a little bit like a rodeo bull rider,\" Smart said. \"This guy will do anything and he's good at it. Trust me, I know from experience. He's good .\" The 12th-ranked Bulldogs (3-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) are the higher-ranked team in this matchup, but will still be about a touchdown underdog when they travel to face the 23rd-ranked Rebels (1-2, 0-1) on Saturday. Georgia has won 10 straight games in the series dating back to 1996. Smart was Alabama's defensive coordinator last season when Kelly torched the Tide for 341 yards passing, three passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown in a 43-37 victory for the Rebels. Now Smart is ready for round two. He said the goal is to keep Kelly off balance, and used a baseball metaphor to illustrate the Bulldogs' plan. \"You've got to be able to pitch,\" Smart said. \"You've got to throw the fastball, you've got to throw a curveball. You've got to be able to change it up and you've got to throw the slider. You can't do the same thing all the time .\" It is obvious Smart has a lot of respect for Kelly. The Ole Miss quarterback said the feeling is mutual when it comes to Georgia's defense. \"They're big and athletic. They play really smart,\" Kelly said. \"I think that's a compliment to their head coach and their defensive coordinator. They do a really good job of staying in the right place. We have to make sure we play hard and keep the turnovers down .\" Kelly has thrown for 953 yards and 10 touchdowns this season, but his four interceptions have been costly. One was returned for a touchdown last week in the Rebels' 48-43 loss to Alabama. \"I have to take it upon myself to keep putting it in my head to take care of the ball,\" Kelly said. ___ Some other things to watch when Ole Miss hosts Georgia on Saturday: ENGRAM'S THE TARGET: Ole Miss senior tight end Evan Engram has emerged as Kelly's favorite target this season. He's caught 20 passes for 302 yards this season. Both numbers are tops in the nation for a tight end. Said Kelly: \"He's a heck of an athlete. He's a playmaker, he's aggressive. He likes to hit people, too. He's a blocker, so he's not just a receiving tight end .\" REBELS STRUGGLE TO KEEP LEADS: Ole Miss has already let two big leads get away during losses this season. The Rebels led Florida State 28-6 on Sept. 5 before eventually losing 45-34. Last weekend, Ole Miss had a 24-3 lead on No. 1 Alabama before the Tide rallied to win 48-43. GEORGIA CAN COME BACK: While Ole Miss has had trouble keeping leads, Georgia has proven adept at coming back after falling behind early in games. The Bulldogs trailed by 10 points to both North Carolina and Missouri before winning both games. CHUBB'S RESURGENCE: Georgia running back Nick Chubb has had a great start to the season after missing a big chunk of 2015 with a serious knee injury. The 5-foot-10, 228-pound junior has run for 365 yards and three touchdowns through three games. Said Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze: \"Another great test for sure. They are going to present a great challenge to us in the run game and we've got to be sure that our eyes are disciplined .\" MCKENZIE EMERGES: Georgia receiver Isaiah McKenzie is having a breakout year, catching 18 passes for 305 yards and four touchdowns in three games. He had 10 catches for 122 yards and two touchdowns in last week's win against Missouri. ____ Follow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP.
