After a period of two years when rate setters focused on disinflation, steering price growth from almost 17 percent to near 4 percent, their attention now is on keeping it stable and low, Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday at a panel during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum .\" In some sense, the focus of our monetary policy has already changed slightly, \"she said. The aim is to ensure\" a gradual decline of annual inflation to 4 percent and holding it near that level in the future. \"With the price goal within reach months ahead of schedule, the central bank is broadening the scope of policy and clarifying its intentions after two surprise rate cuts of half a percentage point each. But its stance remains\" moderately tight, \"leaving Nabiullina to temper expectations of a pivot toward deeper easing two weeks before the Bank of Russia reviews borrowing costs again .\" We don't rush to loosen monetary policy sharply and quickly because we need to be sure that low inflation is rooted in such fundamental factors as a propensity to consume, a propensity to save, based on inflation expectations, \"she said. The central bank will cut its key rate to 9 percent from 9.25 percent at its June 16 meeting, according to most of the economists polled by Bloomberg.

The U.S. Senate minority leader, who has to get past a tea party challenger to get to the general election where the Democratic opponent is gaining traction, isn't getting much love from Iowa Republicans who hope to help the GOP to win back control of the Senate in this fall's mid-term elections. Sam Clovis, a retired Air Force colonel and college professor, doesn't mince words when asked whether he'll support McConnell, a five-term senator who has been minority leader since 2007. \"I think we need a change in leadership in the United States Senate,\" he said at a Republican forum in Ida Grove back in November. \"I'm going to go onto the floor of the Senate and make sure that vote goes to a leader other than the one we have right now. That's the first thing .\" Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky If that wasn't clear enough, Clovis told a tea party gathering in December that \"If Mitch McConnell still wants to be the leader, he's not going to have my vote .\" Former U.S. Attorney Matt Whitaker has been a bit more nuanced. When asked about the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, during a Tea Party Express interview, Whitaker said he favors repeal. \"But who the leader is in the Senate is going to make a big difference,\" Whitaker said, \"and if it's someone like Sen. McConnell from Kentucky I'm not sure we're going to have the same opportunities to advance a conservative agenda including repealing Obamacare that we would with a true conservative leader .\" While it might seem rash to be disrespecting the man who could have a say in which races the GOP senatorial campaign committee commits resources and who will make committee assignments after the election, neither Whitaker nor Clovis see it that way. \"Matt has never met Mitch McConnell and hasn't committed to voting for anyone,\" Whitaker spokesman Jason Klindt said. \"He wants to meet and talk with any candidate for leadership. He will be looking for a conservative leader who can get things done .\" \"I don't know that there's any danger\" in Clovis distancing himself from McConnell said campaign manager Chuck Laudner. \"Mitch McConnell doesn't have a vote in Iowa,\" he said. \"The base of this party, by and large, wants change. What's going on inside the party is not working. So you can't say\" I'll vote for McConnell' because that says more of the same. \"They may be right that there's little danger in being critical of the Senate GOP caucus leader, said Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa associate professor of political science. McConnell, said Hagle, who worked in the Bush administration, has taken a lot of heat from the more tea party-oriented candidates over a variety of actions he has taken .\" I don't know if risky is the right word, but it's probably not the wisest choice of action, \"Hagle said .\" Of course, \"he added,\" you don't have to worry about bad committee assignments if you don't get yourself elected and you can't get elected if you don't get the nomination. \"Clovis and Whitaker may see their anti-McConnell comments as increasing their chances of getting then nomination .\" It's not just political posturing if they see that McConnell has been a problem advancing the agenda they are running on, \"Hagle said. That's the strategy, according to Laudner, who said Clovis repudiation of McConnell is an applause line .\" People instinctively get it - what kind of a Republican, conservative you are, \"he said. It's one of the top three questions Clovis gets asked, Laudner said. The answer says everything about the candidate .\" It tells the Republican voter what kind of senator you will be, whether you are someone they can trust to go in there and do the right thing, \"Laudner said .\" You can't dodge it. If you dodge this one, the rest is a dodge. \"Clovis leans toward Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who he will campaign with later this month, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul or Utah Sen. <mark>Mike Lee</mark>. Whitaker hasn't committed to supporting anyone for the top GOP post, Klindt said .\" He wants to meet and talk with any candidate for leadership, \"Klindt said .\" He will be looking for a conservative leader who can get things done. \"GOP candidates <mark>Mark Jacobs</mark> and Scott Schaben say it's too early to make a decision whether to support McConnell .\" <mark>Mark</mark> is focused on his June primary and then winning the November general election, as is Sen. McConnell, \"said <mark>Jacobs</mark> spokeswoman Alissa Ohl said .\" Senate Republican leadership is a question for after the elections. \"While he didn't commit to voting for McConnell, <mark>Jacobs</mark> did show some respect .\" <mark>Mark</mark> has great respect for Sen. McConnell leading the united Republican charge on repealing Obamacare and <mark>Harry Reid</mark>'s job-killing agenda, \"Ohl added. Schaben says he's focused on his own race .\" If (McConnell) is still there when I arrive in D.C., I'll address it at that time, \"Schaben said .\" I hope this doesn't sound coy; just being honest. \""}, {"articleID": "2014070722_00091372_W", "names": {"Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"], "Nelson Cruz": ["Q1133784", "Q11957344", "Q6990454"]}, "date": "2014-07-07", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/sns-rt-us-britain-abuse-inquiry-20140707,0,3267653.story?track=rss", "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has ordered a wide-ranging inquiry into historical child sex allegations stretching over several decades, Home Secretary <mark>Theresa May</mark> said on Monday.

The ninth ranked Indians are unbeaten so far in the tournament, having registered comfortable wins over Uruguay (4-1), Poland (5-0) and Fiji (11-0).

India are just one win away from securing their place in the final round of Tokyo Olympic qualifiers to be held later this year with two top spots up for grabs from here. And achieving that goal shouldn't be much of a problem for the Indians. In all their pool matches, India plenty of scoring opportunities but conversion rate is an area which is of a little concern for chief coach Sjoerd Marijne. \"We want to perform at the highest level possible and I believe there is still room for improvement,\" Marijne had said. \"Our conversion rate can definitely be higher and if that happens it will be easier for us to win matches .\" Chile, on the hand, finished second in their pool and had to go through the cross-overs to seal their place in the last-four round.
