intended to help struggling homeowners stay in their homes. however, many homeowners who purchased their home at the housing peak may be too far underwater to qualify for the current program. now the fhfa is considering expanding the ltv limits to help more homeowners. for more see the following article from the bad news is, home prices have fallen, plunging you underwater on your mortgage and meaning you owe more on your home than it's currently worth. the good news is, there's a federal refinance program out there that can help you get into a mortgage rate that will lower your monthly payments to a figure you can afford. but the really bad news is, mortgage rates keep going up. and you're too far underwater to apply, anyway. at least for now. currently, the obama administration's making home affordable refinance program allows for borrowers with mortgages up to 105% loan-to-value (ltv) - or 5% more than the current market value of the home - to qualify for refinance. the program applies to those with mortgages held or guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises fannie mae (fnm: 0.62 -7.46%) and freddie mac (fre: 0.65 -7.14%). but critics for months have said the ltv limit will not reach the borrowers who need it most - those who purchased more than three years ago, with little money down and when house prices hit a peak. and with mortgage rates edging back up in recent weeks from historic lows, refinancing in general for those who do qualify is growing difficult. federal housing finance agency director <mark>james lockhart</mark>, in a press conference last week, acknowledged rising mortgage rates pose an issue to the agency refi program. \"there's a big pipeline so it probably won't hit for a couple months,\" he said. \"but at some point, if we don't see some moderation of rates, it could have an impact .\" he also acknowledged the administration is considering expanding the ltv range to cover borrowers with more than 105% ltv, although he would give no exact figure for the new ltv target. fhfa, fannie and freddie's conservator, has said applying <mark>lockhart</mark>'s comment to the effect of 125% ltvs are eligible for sale into real estate mortgage investment conduits toward plans for a new refi ltv limit are a misrepresentation of <mark>lockhart</mark>'s comments. media reports that the ltv limit could top as much as 125% might be speculation, but the idea is catching on, with jp morgan commentary on the mortgage-backed securities market late last week echoing the figure. \"we expect the proposal to raise the obama refi ltv limit to 125 [%] will have a minimal impact on speeds since only under 10% of the universe could benefit theoretically,\" the analysts said. housingwire, a website covering finance news for the

corp. assembly plant in orion township appears to have won the contest to build a new small car, beating out gm plants in wisconsin and tennessee. a person briefed on the decision told the associated press that the announcement the car will be built at a retooled midsize car factory in orion will come today. gm officials insisted a final decision hasn't been made. \"we have to notify our employees first,\" said gm spokeswoman katie mcbride. u.s. rep. <mark>mike rogers</mark>, a republican whose district includes portions of northern oakland county, called the report of orion's selection \"a credit to michigan's workers and management .\" their record of quality and accomplishment won them this opportunity, \"<mark>rogers</mark> said .\" it is the job of all of us in elected office, especially michigan's congressional delegation, to make sure that there are more opportunities to bring jobs to michigan. \"oakland county executive l. brooks patterson was waiting for the formal announcement by gm .\" i told them if it was good news to call me at 9 a.m. if it was bad news never to speak to me again, \"patterson said. the decision will protect 1,200 jobs at the factory, which otherwise would have shut for good. it's also expected to help protect jobs at the gm metal fabricating plant on the north side of pontiac. gm officials indicated they were concerned about the political backlash in tennessee and wisconsin from the decision .\" other communications need to occur before we can say anything about this issue, \"said another gm official. a consultant familiar with the competition between the three states said officials from wisconsin had offered $70 million in tax credits. it appears michigan's offer was larger and\" that might tip the scales, \"the consultant said in a private e-mail to the oakland press in pontiac. gov. jennifer granholm has not released details of michigan's offer, pending gm's announcement, but local officials were very optimistic. meanwhile, the governor's office has scheduled a separate press conference in birmingham to announce that general electric corp. now plans to build a new technology center in michigan aimed at developing clean energy. the center, which is likely to be located in southeast michigan, could bring as many as 1,200 new jobs to the state .\" there is still a very positive feeling in the air, \"said orion township supervisor matthew gibb, after a meeting thursday with representatives from the michigan economic development corp. gibb said orion had offered a 100 percent tax abatement over the next 25 years to secure the small car project. orion township agreed to expand and extend the rebate after gm pointed out that wisconsin offered a 100 percent tax abatement .\" we had to consider what the others were offering, \"gibb said. the orion project also is expected to bring new work to gm's metal fabricating plant in pontiac, which is also threatened with permanent shutdown. cash-strapped pontiac also offered gm a 100 percent tax credit for the metal fabricating plant. gm ceo fritz henderson said last week the chosen plant would be re-equipped not only to build a new small subcompact gm was planning to import from china but another vehicle as well, starting in late 2011 or early 2012. the new plant will not only build a small subcompact car, but also will be equipped to build other models, he said. the fact gm spent $600 million re-tooling the spring hill plant just last year was thought to have given the spring hill plant something of an edge in the competition. if tennessee loses the competition, the state's political establishment is certain to argue that the state is being punished for opposing gm's original request for government aid back in december. the janesville plant in wisconsin is nearly 100 years old and henderson had expressly ruled out building any kind of new plant. orion has its own energy source from a nearby landfill and reputation for building quality vehicles, having scored well on a j.d. power initial quality survey released earlier this week, gm insiders noted. meanwhile, gm has confirmed plans to close its assembly and stamping plants in shreveport, la., no later than june 2012. the announcement follows gm's disclosure that gm is shifting production of the gmc sierra hybrid pickup truck from canada to a factory in mexico rather than in the u.s. the silao, mexico, plant will take over assembly of the truck from the oshawa, ontario, facility that closed last month, according to gm. the shreveport plant might close even sooner depending on market demand for gm vehicles, according to shocked uaw officials. gm also is moving ahead with another round of buyouts and offers of early retirements among its salaried employees in the united states. new plans call for the elimination of about 4,000 additional salaried jobs by oct. 1. some involuntary cuts could be required if gm doesn't get enough volunteers to accept the buyouts, said gm spokesman <mark>tom wilkinson</mark>. gm had 29,650 jobs at the start of 2009 and in february gm said it planned to reduce the number of salaried employees to 26,000. the new buyouts are intended to trim the total to 23,500. gm plans to trim the number of executive positions by about 35 percent this year, to about 850, <mark>wilkinson</mark> said. the

myers beach in the form of washed out $5 bills disguised as $50 reprints. local beach businesses - such as tropics bar & grill and the beach whale-have been feeling the pinch when depositing daily money at their respective banks. the targeted spots are out of luck if the money they deposit is counterfeit. \"as soon as we receive a counterfeit bill, basically we have to take the bill and send it out straight to the secret service,\" said gerald mercado of wachovia bank on 2815 estero blvd. \"there's a report we have to fill out. we send out the report with the bill and they send it right back saying they received it .\" the fraudulent bill gets seized until the secret service lets the bank know if the bill is counterfeit or not. \"(the counterfeit process involves) $5 bills that are washed out and a $50 print is placed on top of it,\" said mercado, who has detected $400 in counterfeit money in the past week or two. \"if it's not counterfeit, they'll send the bill back to us and we'll notify the customer .\" bank tellers are familiar with the touch, feel and look of money. they are accustomed to detect fake money...unlike a bartender or server who is more inclined to take a quick look and make change. \"you have to take a second and look at the bill,\" said <mark>jeff kelly</mark>, resident agent in charge at the fort myers secret service office. \"genuine currency will not bleed. if these bills get wet, the ink runs just like a document that is printed. also, check the other security features. the portraits should match on the bill if you hold it up to the light .\" fast food and drink does not always equal fastidious measures. \"that's the whole problem with the economy,\" said <mark>kelly</mark>. \"we live in a fast-pace world where workers are trained to get people in and out. if you look at the $5 bill, you can obviously tell it's counterfeit by the water mark of abraham lincoln and the security strip which is embedded in the paper that says usa 5 on it. the merchant taking the bill makes a decision in a split second. they need to slow down and take a look at the bill .\" <mark>kelly</mark> said a bleaching agent was used on these type of bills. \"this process is kind of different,\" he said. \"most businesses use the counterfeit detecting pen to deter counterfeiting, but the pen won't react to that because it is genuine paper .\" mercado said the counterfeit pen detectors are only 60 percent accurate anyway. an effective pen will detect a yellow or clear mark to indicate a good bill, while a brown or gray mark is a suspected bill. times have changed when making counterfeit bills was deemed an art, according to <mark>kelly</mark>. \"people reprint notes using ink jet technology which accounts for 70 percent of the counterfeit out there,\" he said. \"you used to have to be skilled; an artist. now, with the day and age of the computer and computer printers, anyone can hook it up .\" the local secret service agency receives an average of $3,000 to $4,000 in counterfeit bills every five days. compare that to miami's $35,000 to $40,000 for the same period of time. the majority of $100 bills and larger notes come from overseas. \"only 1/100 of one percent of money is counterfeit,\" said <mark>kelly</mark>. \"that's out of $700 billion. during the civil war, 1 of every 3 bills was counterfeit. then the secret service was established in 1865 to combat counterfeiters .\" we're known for protecting leaders of this country, but we were first created to combat counterfeit money. with our partnerships with local law enforcement, u.s. and state attorneys offices, we track down and investigate every counterfeit bill that gets passed. \"both men have noticed that fort myers beach was targeted recently and offer advice if counterfeit money reaches your hands again .\" if it looks funny, don't take it, \"said mercado .\" most important, if you do receive a counterfeit bill and you know who passed it to you, call 911, \"said <mark>kelly</mark>.\" the local sheriff's office will respond. also, try to jot down suspect information like description and tag number. \"fort myers beach bulletin | fort myers
