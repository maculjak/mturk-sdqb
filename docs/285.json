You use an agile process; your goal is to make your organization more agile. But what about your data infrastructure? The truth is, today's databases are anything but agile - they are effectively static repositories that are cumbersome to work with, difficult to change, and cannot keep pace with application demands. Performance suffers as a result, and it takes far longer than it should to deliver new features and capabilities needed to make your organization competitive. As your application an...\"We are strong believers in the DevOps movement and our staff has been doing DevOps for large enterprise environments for a number of years.

But \"Brooklyn,\" her new film debuting Monday in the Premiers section at Sundance, was something different. \"Playing someone normal was the biggest challenge,\" the now 20-year-old actress says. \"I wasn't used to it .\" An image from the documentary \"Meru,\" about three Americans climbing a perilous face of Mt. Meru in Nepal. It's directed by Jimmy Chin, one of the climbers, and E. Chai Vasarhelyi. \"3 1/2 Minutes,\" in the U.S. documentary section, is directed by Marc Silver. It examines how and why an unarmed black teenager in Florida was killed for playing rap music too loud. \"The Wolfpack,\" in the U.S. documentary competition, is directed by Crystal Moselle. It focuses on six movie-crazed brothers who spend their childhood making meticulous re-creations of films like \"Reservoir Dogs .\" U.S. documentary competitor \"Welcome to Leith,\" directed by Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker. It looks at what happens when a hard-core white supremacist attempts to take over a tiny North Dakota town. \"The Summer of Sangaile,\" directed by Alante Kavaite, is in the world dramatic competition. A haunting, hypnotically shot story out of Lithuanian about a young woman in love with flying.

Ask her how old she was when she began acting and she'll reply, with amusement and style, \"I was in the womb, Kenny. I was zero. It started when my mum and dad had a glimmer in their eye .\" Eilis is \"Brooklyn's\" protagonist, a young woman who emigrates from Ireland to that celebrated New York borough in 1952 and ends up contending with homesickness, culture shock and a variety of romantic involvements. Impeccably directed by <mark>John Crowley</mark> and elegantly adapted by <mark>Nick Hornby</mark> from a novel by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, \"Brooklyn\" is classic filmmaking beautifully done, illustrating the power of restraint in dealing with emotional material. And as Ronan's first time \"telling an Irish story in an Irish film,\" it has special meaning. \"I get very emotional when I talk about it; I hope I'm not going to start crying,\" the actress says. \"I never had a film affect me like that. It was very much a passion project for all the people involved .\" It's not only that \"for generation after generation, the relationship has been so close between Ireland and the United States\" but there's a personal connection as well. \"My mom and dad made that journey,\" says Ronan, who was born in the New York area and moved back to Ireland with her parents when she was 3. \"The town we shot in in Ireland was close to where I grew up, where I spent my childhood. Every second scene knocked me over by how it affected me .\" So for the actress, another of the challenges of \"Brooklyn\" was \"trying to find a balance, giving the story color, but at the same time holding back, keeping control. It was hard. I was very aware I didn't want to do too many crying scenes, I didn't want to do too much blubbering.

In the time it took to do eight takes, you discovered more and more about what you were doing. He revealed to me so many different elements in my character I hadn't really considered before. He made me more present because of the way he works. \"Because Ronan is roughly the same age as Eilis, and in fact has just gotten a place of her own in London, elements of Eilis' situation ring especially true .\" Really, this film is about choice, about when you've gone through enough life experience to make a choice for yourself, \"Ronan says .\" Eilis is finally at the stage in her life where she knows not what she needs to do but what she wants. That's a really empowering thing. \"Part of the choice Eilis has to make involves two suitors, played by Domhnall Gleeson and Emory Cohen. The men do not meet in the film, but the cast did have an introductory dinner together, and Ronan jokes that\" once we got past the fact that the film wasn't real, they were able to chill out and have fun. \"Fun was a theme of Ronan's early years in New York, where her father was a working actor .\" My parents were both very expressive people, and exposure to American humor broadened their world, \"she says.

A fresh proposal to amalgamate the Scottish Golf Union and Scottish Ladies Golfing Association will be put to a vote at the latter's annual general meeting in the Capital on Saturday week. If successful - and the SLGA membership agreed to it last time around - then the spotlight will be back on the men. In 2012, the SGU failed to gain sufficient support for the proposal and since then a lot of work has gone in to try and rebuild bridges. As the attempt to make it second-time lucky gathers pace, Capital clubs are being urged to have their say though voting in an independent poll. Now open and running until February 27, it is being conducted after agreement between the SGU Board and Area Associations, of which the Lothians is the largest. \"We encourage and advise all affiliated SGU clubs to vote in the independent poll,\" said SGU chairman <mark>Tom Craig</mark>. \"Currently, this is the most significant issue facing Scottish Golf. Amalgamation is fundamentally important to building a modern, democratic, inclusive governing body for Scottish amateur golf .\" It is vital we pass on a fit for purpose organisation for the next generation to take the game forward. \"It creates the opportunity to build an effective partnership among golfers, Clubs, Areas, Counties, Board and staff for the greater good of Scottish Golf .\" A single body will help attract more women into golf and remove some of the stigma of a male-dominated game. \"Meanwhile, world No. 2 Henrik Stenson has still to decide if he'll play in this summer's Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open at Gullane. The Swede used the event two years ago as the springboard to his rise back up the world rankings, finishing second to Phil Mickelson in The Open at Muirfield the following week before going on to top the money-list on both sides of the Atlantic. But Stenson didn't play in last year's Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen and has yet to make up his mind about heading to East Lothian in July. * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.

Indianapolis Business Journal, Teagan Development, Inc. is planning to buy the 539,000-square-foot Circle City Industrial Complex from the National Bank of Indianapolis, which took control of the property about four years ago from previous owner E & E Realty LLC. The complex dates back to the early 1920s, when it served as a factory for the Schwitzer Corp.. Located in the Windsor Park neighborhood, in an area which serves as the entrance to the Cottage Home neighborhood, the building now hosts a mix of about 50 tenants, including not-for-profit RecycleForce. At its southern end, the property also includes a vacant portion of about 120,000 square feet that holds the highest redevelopment potential. Plans call for approximately 40,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, 30,000 square feet of incubator space to be used for small manufacturing, while the remaining 50,000 square feet would be demolished to make way for the construction of a parking facility and an access drive to link Brookside and Massachusetts avenues. \"This building and this location have the bones for what I call the next overnight sensation,\" <mark>Larry Jones</mark>, the company president, told the newspaper. \"It's an area where the residents of Cottage Home have put 25-plus years into turning that neighborhood around .\" The area is currently going through a revitalization phase, thanks to a number of residential developments, including Stenz Corp.'s Hillwood Investment Moving Ahead with $165M Legacy Park; Tennessee Receives $28M in CDBG", "articleID": "2015012907_00026041_W", "names": {"Larry Jones": ["Q16227670", "Q16730409", "Q6490591", "Q6490592", "Q742049"]}}]
