(you can read my finale review here .) in fact, if the ultimate decision-making power on this fell in milch's hands, the show would have continued, though he says he understands and supports what hbo chose to do. instead, it became the third milch series that hbo has canceled before he was finished telling his story, following\" deadwood \"(and he had some illuminating things to say on that subject) and\" john from cincinnati. \"because my old partner matt zoller seitz did such a thorough job interviewing milch and <mark>michael mann</mark> about what exactly happened to the horse, the safety precautions the show took, and about allegations that the horses were mistreated, i didn't go over that ground again. i highly recommend reading matt's interview before this one. and if you want to know even more details of the approach team\" luck \"took to horse safety, i've been given a copy of the show's official safety protocols, plus this note from milch and <mark>mann</mark>: here are luck's protocols and safety procedures. they were stricter than anywhere in the equine world and were in place during the production of luck's 2,500 horse/runs at santa anita. this is in response to the distortions and fabrications stated by peta about the care of horses on the luck production and on behalf of the horse trainers, wranglers, exercise riders, veterinarians and grooms who - with concern and caring - looked after those horses download the safety protocols document here. in the 15 + years i've been interviewing milch, i've never heard him as emotional as he sounded on friday. i'm not sure it quite comes across in text, but the best way i can put it is this: like the college professor he used to be, milch is generally expansive with his commentary, sometimes to a fault, where here he kept his answers brief because it wasn't an easy subject to discuss. this project is something he's been hoping to make for a very long time, a marriage of his vocation and his avocation, and not only did it disappear out from under him in a snap, but he's now being accused of mistreating horses, when he's had a deep love for horses going back to when he was a little boy. there was a lot of pain and sadness - but not, i should say, anger, as he understands why this happened - in his voice as we spoke about the decision to halt production permanently, the differences between this and the\" deadwood \"finale (including a fact about that episode that i never knew before), what might have come later, and a whole lot more, all coming up just as soon as i'm an airport profiler...what were the conversations like that day, between the time when production was suspended and when the decision was made,\" alright, we can't go forward anymore \"? angry incredulity. who was it who ultimately made that call? was it you and <mark>michael</mark>? was it hbo? it was hbo, definitively. there was back and forth about it, but their feeling was so clearly that the situation was untenable, that there was really no protracted dispute. we were presented with an accomplished fact. and i don't say that with any resentment. they made the decision they felt they had to make. but had it been up to you, would that have been the decision? no, i guess i would have continued. in no way was there any irresponsibility or failure of care in the treatment of those horses. i satisfied myself with that repeatedly. i don't know if you're familiar with the details of how this horse died - i read the interview you and <mark>michael</mark> did with matt seitz, so i know a little. this was an incident equivalent to you walking down the street, being frightened by something, taking a misstep and falling. the horse was not being asked to do anything remotely dangerous or that would put him in jeopardy. in any case, this was something that generated its own momentum and fed off itself. corporately, i absolutely understand what hbo felt were the necessities of its position. but substantively, there was no dereliction at all on our part. one of the questions i've heard asked in the wake of the cancellation was whether you could have continued the show without filming new racing scenes, whether using cgi horses or some kind of stock footage. that was a possibility that was examined. the horses are of the essence of the piece. we really weren't doing anything - you need the horses around. it's like asking an actor to act in company with a cartoon. long-term, it would've been an erosion of the credibility of the material. given your passion for this world and how long it took you to get this on the air, how does it feel to have it go away this quickly? it's a sick feeling. you realize, what swearengen used to say,\" if you want to hear god laugh, tell him your plans. \"we're creatures of forces so other than and more powerful than we are, that it's an illustion to believe anything else, and it's an occasion for gratitude wen you're able to sustain your endeavor and fate and experience accommodates it. i say that with no bitterness at all towards hbo. as i say, i think they were in an untenable position. how do you mean? just the bad publicity? yeah. anytime something happened, as it would inevitably have happened, they were going to get lambasted again. corporately, they just can't withstand that. i watched the finale again yesterday, and there are a number of moments and lines that feel prophetic - like marcus saying,\" today's the day they take it all away from us, \"or ace's speech at the end - like they were designed to be in a series finale. and that's always how i've viewed the last\" deadwood \"episode; like it was a series finale without being intended as one. were you ever thinking as you wrote this that there would be a chance you wouldn't get to do more? no, there was no sense of that on my part. by way of contrast, i absolutely knew when i was writing the last\" deadwood \"that it would be the last, and i wrote it intending it as the finale. interesting. i had never heard that before. that's the case. i was trying - the last images of swearengen scrubbing the bloodstain and saying\" wants me to tell him something pretty, \"that was as close as i felt i could come to a concluding speech. so you knew even at that point in production that hbo was not going to go forward? yes, i did know that. how did the episode hold up for you? yeah. (pause) we would have found our stride. i don't think that we had conclusively, but the materials were moving in that direction. it was too bad. it was too bad. what do you think were some of the things that needed to be improved? or what were the parts of the show where you felt you were close to that direction? the extent to which the character of bernstein was living in self-deception was in the process of being revealed. as he encountered that fact and lived into the necessities of his situation, i think he was going to become a more transitive character. and that was very much in the process of being realized. but i try not to think about it too much. i interviewed milch and <mark>mann</mark> at press tour in january, i asked milch whether ace and <mark>walter</mark> never sharing any scenes together in the first season was by design, or if - like much of his work - things just turned out that way. he responded,\" it wasn't planned, but these are characters who have not discovered themselves as yet such as to make their intersection fruitful. they come together right at the beginning of the second season and it is every bit as provisional and tentative a coming together as you would expect, but these are both you know. you know dickens used the expression \"mind - forged manacles .\" these are isolates of one kind and another and they have a civil exchange with each other, but to expect more from them would be unrealistic. they have to find more of themselves first. \"which leads us to this ...) at the end of the interview in january, you and i spoke about how ace and <mark>walter</mark> would come together at the start of the second season. looking back, ace's story is largely separate from everyone else's. was that something that you realized as you were going on that maybe he was too far apart from the rest of the world? yes. i agree with that. it assumed a little bit too much of the viewer, i think. since we're not going to see it play out, what exactly was ace's plan in regards to mike? the best explanation i've seen was from one of my commenters, who suggests that ace wants mike to steal the casino deal out from under him, and that mike will go to prison as a result because it's crooked. is that it? yeah, that's pretty close. when you compress it, invariably you distort it. you obviously have to do what you think is appropriate, but my own preference is not to linger too much on the would have beens of this show. okay, then let's look back on what was instead. in these nine episodes that you were able to make, what do you feel were the strengths of it? what are some scenes you would point to as the show you had in your head all these years? that's a good question. everything that demonstrates the human capacity for perseverance and self-deception simultaneously. those are the scenes that i like. i recall with affection so many of the scenes with the degenerates and that connection. and i enjoyed very much writing the scenes between gus and bernstein. in some ways, i felt that those two sets of relationships mirrored each other. watching the show, it really did feel like your heart was particularly in the scenes with the four degenerates. that's right. if i were to point to a favorite scene, i guess it would be the niagara falls scene, where they were doing the exegesis of niagara fall as opposed to niagara falls, and what the might possibly mean. now that this is done, are you moving full-force onto the william faulkner project? yes. we were just working on the concluding section of\" light in august \"when you called. i had the privilege of working on that with my daughter, olivia. so it's a compounded pleasure. i'm hopeful that hbo will be receptive. i have no reason to think they won't be. this is the third time now you've done a show for them and the third time it's ended before you were intending it to end. are you still okay with the relationship? absolutely. each set of circumstances was unique. you'll have to ask them whether they are (option 1 comment instantly as a guest it's not a cliffhanger. there were places the story could have gone in a fourth season, but no one's fate was hanging in the balance, and most of the stories of the third season came to a close. even though i never watched it myself - horse racing is not my thing - it's a real shame such a talented writer lost his series under such circumstances, because of distortions from a typically hypocritical peta, who put to death about 85% of the animals arriving at their shelters, btw - whereas luck (darkly ironic name, given the series had none) was just the victim of a sad accident. hope milch's next project goes wonderfully for him .\" good wife': matthew perry on his \"strictly sexual'

"http://charlotteobserver.com/2012/03/28/3134172/charlotte-city-manager-hopes-1.html#storylink=rss", "content": "when new property values were released last year, charlotte city manager curt walton said he noticed an \"unsustainable\" trend. due to large parts of the city dropping in value, the affluent wedge of the city south of uptown is now responsible for roughly half of the city's tax base. walton's worry is that charlotte would become similar to an older rust belt city, with a small sliver of the population paying the bills. that inequity is unfair, walton said, and could drive people away from the city. \"let's say we do nothing to change that, and by 2020 those (areas) are now 60 to 70 percent of the tax base,\" walton said. \"that's unsustainable .\" walton said that concern was behind his proposal for a nearly $1 billion capital plan through 2020, which would be paid for by a 9 percent increase in the city property tax. the tax revenue would allow the city to borrow money through bonds, which voters would start approving as soon as this fall. much of the plan would build traditional infrastructure, such as roads, sidewalks and bridges. but the capital program is also designed to bring economic development to the city's poorer areas. it ventures into new territory such as a proposal to spend $10 million with unc-charlotte in an effort to expand the city's technology sector, and it calls for a massive redevelopment of bojangles coliseum in east charlotte. the charlotte city council received the plan last week, and many members appeared to support it, at least in theory. <mark>david howard</mark>, part of a democratic 9-2 majority, said the city must work to increase the taxable value of poorer neighborhoods. \"this isn't a grab,\" <mark>howard</mark> said. \"this is to spread the tax burden .\" the last city property tax increase was in 2006. before that, the previous tax hike was in 1986. <mark>john hood</mark> of the conservative <mark>john locke</mark> foundation in raleigh agreed with walton that charlotte will be challenged as the city matures. but he said the city should focus on making it less expensive by keeping taxes low. \"history suggests that you can't overcome a fundamental cost disadvantage,\" <mark>hood</mark> said. \"it's a very common phenomenon of people moving out. the solution is to work on the cost side. how can you make it less expensive?\" under the plan, the city property tax rate would increase from 43.7 cents to 47.7 cents for every $100 of taxable property. the owner of a house with a taxable value of $200,000 would see their city tax bill increase by $80 a year. city property owners also are taxed separately by mecklenburg county. walton said he's sensitive to people having to pay more. \"i get that. people feel like they are paying enough,\" walton said. but he said the burden on taxpayers could be higher in the future if the city doesn't attract investment into less-affluent areas. walton said for years charlotte was able to grow its tax base relatively easy, as new neighborhoods were built in places like ballantyne and the city was able to annex other parts of mecklenburg county. but the city is now running out of room, with the city limits pushing up against other counties and other municipalities. affluent residents are choosing to move to south carolina, or union or cabarrus counties. capital plan the city has divided the capital program into three areas: neighborhood improvements ($334.5 million); transportation connections ($287 million); corridor investment ($305 million).? the neighborhood improvements are similar to past investments. it includes $124.5 million for public safety investments, including a $64 million join communications center to handle 911 and 311 calls and $56.5 million for six new police division stations. there is $60 million for affordable housing. and there is $120 million for improvements in the prosperity; whitehall; west trade/rozelles ferry; cental and sunset neighborhoods .? the transportation connections include $199 million to build between two and three miles of a streetcar line. it also includes $60 million for sidewalks and pedestrian safety, and $48 million to better synchronize traffic signals and repair and replace bridges .? the corridor investments are designed to promote economic development. for instance, the city plans to spend $43 million on road improvements west of charlotte/douglas airport, which is designed to accommodate distribution centers and warehouses expected to be built after norfolk-southern opens a new rail-to-truck transfer center at the airport. the city would spend $25 million as part of an overall $60 million plan to retrofit bojangles coliseum to make it more suitable for amateur sports. it would spend $102.5 million on infrastructure improvements along the corridor for the lynx blue line extension. perhaps the most unusual proposal is to spend $10 million partnering with unc-charlotte for its college of computing and informatics. the city hopes that its money will pay off with the creation of new start-ups and other businesses. <mark>bob morgan</mark>, president of charlotte chamber, said he can't yet endorse the plan. but he said he is impressed with the overall concept. \"it's a much different approach,\" <mark>morgan</mark> said. \"i comment curt and his team for having the creativity for looking at things in a different way .\" <mark>morgan</mark> said his first concern was how much money would be directed towards roads, which the chamber considers critical. he said the amount - $350 million - is a good number. if city council goes forward with the plan, the chamber would likely take the lead in a campaign to convince voters to approve the bonds. city staff are prohibited from using tax dollars to lobby voters. the focus on the city's more struggling neighborhoods has raised concerns among at least one council member, republican andy dulin, who represents south charlotte. during last week's meeting, dulin asked whether south charlotte - which he said pays much of the city's property tax bill - would get a fair deal. if council oks the plan, the city would hold bond referendums in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.", "articleID": "2012032822_00063081_W", "names": {"Bob Morgan": ["Q16732848", "Q57833888", "Q888143"], "David

gray</mark>, reuters april 1, 2012, 2:43 am miami, march 31 (reuters) - get ready, baseball fans. miami, the city of sun and fun, wants to bring some flair to america's favorite pastime. when baseball's opening day kicks off next week, the miami marlins will inaugurate a new $515 million ballpark built with all the trappings of south florida--two enormous fish tanks, palm trees and a kitschy (of course) home run celebration display. the stadium, named marlins park, \"screams miami,\" team owner jeffrey loria has said. the white semi-domed stadium is an attempt by loria and city officials to reignite fan interest in a team that won the world series in 1997, and again in 2003, but finished at the bottom of the national league east division standings last year. they also hope it will help revitalize miami's little havana neighborhood, a rough-and-tumble district near downtown and a cultural symbol for many in miami's large cuban community. the stadium's official opening on wednesday will mark a new chapter for the marlins, who have changed their name, redesigned their uniforms and embarked on a spending spree for a high-profile manager and free-agent players to breathe new life into the team. to win over fans, the marlins are offering up a baseball experience with a dash of latin and south beach style. the stadium's signature feature will be its backdrop at home plate. two 450-gallon salt water aquariums sit on either side and will be stocked with 100 tropical fish. \"when you think of miami, you think of water, right?\" said claude delorme, a marlins executive vice president. \"we wanted a unique piece that identifies where we are .\" the fish tanks are built of durable fiberglass and protected by a material used in bullet-proof glass. to ensure they would withstand impacts from baseballs, team officials brought in a marlins player to hurl balls to test out the glass. the tanks will be lit with blue lights during games to make sure players do not lose sight of the balls. \"home run sculpture' behind the outfield is a home run celebration display few will confuse with being anywhere but south florida. team officials call it a\" home run sculpture. \"designed by american pop artist red grooms, the 72-foot yellow, blue and neon pink structure features seagulls, flamingos, and a pointy-billed teal marlin that will leap every time a home run is hit. it is set next to - what else - palm trees. the home run celebration will also include a 34-second splash effect and laser show .\" some people have been critical of it, \"delorme joked .\" but it adds to the experience of coming out to the ballpark. \"no new ballpark in miami would be complete without a swimming pool. marlins park will be the second major u.s. baseball stadium after chase field in phoenix, arizona, to feature a swimming pool for fans looking to enjoy the game from a different vantage point .\" we wanted to have this party area in left field, \"delorme said .\" so people would see it on tv and say, you know what, i want to go there. \"about four feet deep, the pool is part of an area that was conceived with the clevelander, a well-known south beach party-goers hotel. the pool side area includes a bar and djs .\" there will be home run balls landing in the pool, so people will have to be alert, \"delorme said. built on the old site of miami's orange bowl, the stadium offers an intimate setting that will hold a mere 37,442 spectators - the smallest capacity in baseball. it also has a host of other amenities that fans complained were missing from the marlins' previous home, sun life stadium, in suburban north miami, where the miami dolphins also play. the stadium's roof is retractable - key when miami's rainy season sets in. air conditioning in the stadium will maintain an average temperature of 75 degrees to keep fans comfortable during florida's muggy summer months. the stadium, however, has not been without controversy. when plans for its construction were first announced, it drew howls from some miami residents who complained taxpayers were picking up the tab for three-fourths of the stadium's costs. it was financed using municipal bonds. the stadium's financing is now the focus of a probe by the securities and exchange commission. still, it has generated buzz in miami and team officials say they hope it proves to be a draw not only for baseball fans .\" you could bring someone here who does not like baseball and they could have a really good time, \"delorme said .\" and they'll want to come back. \"(editing by greg mccune
