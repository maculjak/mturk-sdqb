the first name is the same, and the houston texans say not much else is changing, either. matt leinart practiced for the first time as the texans' starting quarterback on monday, with matt schaub likely out for the season with a right foot injury. the texans (7-3) are coming off a bye week and play at jacksonville (3-7) on sunday. leinart has been anxiously awaiting a chance to start again ever since he was demoted in arizona in 2008 in favor of kurt warner. he signed with the texans after the cardinals cut him in september 2010. \"i've worked hard, i've been focused every day since i've been here, preparing for an opportunity like this, just in case this ever came up,\" leinart said. \"now it's just time to take all that preparation onto the field .\" the 2004 heisman trophy winner did not take a snap in a game as a backup to schaub last season. he became a free agent, but re-signed with houston because he was comfortable with coach gary kubiak and the texans' offensive system. he's also found a strong support system within the team that he feels will help get his career back on track. \"i've been surrounded by positivity, i've gotten my confidence back over the last 18 months,\" leinart said. \"i feel good, ready for this opportunity .\" schaub sustained a right foot injury during houston's 37-9 win over tampa bay on nov. 13. he watched monday's practice in a protective boot will visit a foot specialist in charlotte on wednesday. kubiak is hoping to get a \"definitive answer\" on whether schaub will need season-ending surgery. he's holding out hope that schaub will return this season, but he's comfortable using leinart for the rest of the season, if it comes to that. \"you can see the fire in his eyes,\" kubiak said. \"what a great opportunity for him in his career. he'll give us everything he's got .\" leinart is left-handed and schaub throws right-handed, but kubiak said that won't alter the offensive game plans much. and the linemen say there's nothing different with leinart taking snaps, other than right tackle eric winston becoming the quarterback's blind-side protector. \"there's no difference in the running game, there's no difference in protections, there's no difference in anything else,\" said winston, who's made 81 consecutive starts. \"i haven't seen us put anything (new) in yet. we're going to run the same running plays we always have .\" left-handed, right-handed, under-handed, \"winston said,\" i don't think it really matters. \"and leinart should benefit from the return of all-pro receiver <mark>andre johnson</mark>, who's expected to play sunday after missing six games with a right hamstring injury. he can also lean on the league's second-best rushing offense (158 yards per game), with arian foster and ben tate in the backfield behind him .\" i don't think much is going to change, \"leinart said .\" i just think we're going to go out there and execute the offense that we've been doing, and that's running the football, and play - (action) pass and getting out on the outside and making some plays. \"rookie t.j. yates, a fifth-round pick out of north carolina, is leinart's backup, but kubiak isn't ruling out adding another quarterback this week. <mark>jeff garcia</mark>, brodie croyle, trent edwards, kellen clemens and former rice star <mark>chase clement</mark> tried out for the team monday morning. the 41-year-old <mark>garcia</mark> hasn't played in the nfl since 2009. he played for omaha in the ufl last year. edwards was cut by oakland in training camp after spending three full seasons with buffalo and one in jacksonville. clemens was cut by washington during training camp, and that may give him an edge - the redskins are coached by <mark>mike shanahan</mark>, kubiak's longtime mentor. the contents of this website may not be reproduced without written"}, {"articleID": "2014120712_00059412_W", "names": {"Stephen Turnbull": ["Q3176384", "Q7610717"], "Tom Wade": ["Q10420373", "Q22762714"]}, "date": "2014-12-07", "url": "http://chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/blyth-spartans-hero-admits-didnt-8241141", "content": "Newcastle clubs introduce state of the art ID scanners to help pinpoint trouble makers Blyth Spartans hero reveals his joy at scoring 90th minute winner Hatem Ben Arfa will return to Newcastle United in January after Hull move turns sour Rob Elliot reveals he played on through the pain barrier for Newcastle United Newcastle 2-1 Chelsea: Five things we learned as soaring Magpies shoot down Premier League leaders <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>, one of Blyth Spartans' FA Cup heroes, admits he didn't see his goal coming against Hartlepool on Friday night <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>, one of Blyth Spartans' FA Cup heroes, admits he didn't see his goal coming against Hartlepool on Friday night \"data-type =\" fb-share \"data-action =\" article:8241141 \"> <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>, one of Blyth Spartans' FA Cup heroes, admits he didn't see his goal coming against Hartlepool on Friday night\" data-type = \"tw-share\" data-action = \"article:8241141\" > <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>, one of Blyth Spartans' FA Cup heroes, admits he didn't see his goal coming against Hartlepool on Friday night Blyth Spartans goalscorer <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark> celebrates after the FA Cup Second round match between Hartlepool United and Blyth Spartans <mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark> has admitted he did not see one of the best goals of FA Cup second-round weekend coming. The League Two side bossed the opening half-hour and took the lead through Jonathan Franks. But once Turnbull equalised in the 56th minute there was only one team in it - even if it did take until the 90th minute for Jarrett Rivers to confirm his side's place in tomorrow's third-round draw. And Turnbull admitted he had not been on that sort of form on the training ground. \"I'd been practising them all week in training and couldn't hit a barn door,\" said Turnbull, who started his career at Victoria Park. \"I said to Robbie Dale,\" I'm going to hit this \". Never in my dreams did I think I'd catch it like I did .\" It didn't just go in the top corner, it curled into the side-netting. \"Afterwards, our manager <mark>Tom Wade</mark> said that Alan Shearer (working for BBC television on the night) said it was the best free-kick he'd ever seen. Wow. That's good enough for me .\" Turnbull also set up the winner, releasing Rivers for the fairytale finish which sparked a bench clearance and a pitch invasion. \"I gave him (Rivers) the ball, it was a good pass, and I just thought,\" Go on, run at them', \"said Turnbull, part of the Bury team expelled from the competition for fielding an ineligible player in 2006 .\" Unbelievable. It was just incredible. \"I can't wait for tomorrow's draw - at least I know we'll definitely be playing in it this time .\" After the game <mark>Wade</mark> was keen to stress Turnbull's contribution went way beyond the pitch. \"<mark>Stephen</mark> and Phil Turnbull are probably two of the best midfield players around the area,\" he said. \"<mark>Stephen Turnbull</mark>'s just a great lad. He's got great ability and he's great in the changing room because he gets the young lads playing and gives them confidence .\" It was a fantastic goal but his overall play was fantastic. \"You saw the bench go up when the goals went in and even the lads who weren't stripped. I think that's the difference .\" We're a very, very close team and a close changing room. \"Blyth's win was extra sweet for Nathan Buddle. The defender was released by Pools club at the end of the 2012-13 season, much to his disappointment, and that gave Friday night's game at Victoria Park added spice for him.

final first leg. allardyce's men also face a trip to manchester city and a home game against fulham in their battle for premier league points in the coming weeks but, for the moment, the rovers boss is dreaming of glory. he said: \"this month becomes one thing and one thing only first and that is trying to get to wembley .\" alright, premier league is what we are all about and definitely the most important for the football club but not this month. \"we will deal with the premier league when it comes around .\" this month is going to determine whether we slip into a battle for premier league survival only or whether we are top of the tree in terms of going relatively well in the premier league and looking forward to a wembley final and even possibly getting through to the next round of the fa cup. \"this is the biggest month of the season for us and every player will have to give more than they have given all year, and they have given a lot, but they will have to give a whole lot more if they want to achieve something special and we are on the brink of achieving something special .\" they have to take it by the horns and make sure they are not miserable by the end of it.

it?, \"said allardyce .\" i had to chuckle when the draw came out, i thought what have we got here. \"from my point of view seven games in january and we have built of squad of players that are there to be used in times like this .\" we now begin to use the squad to its full potential because of the amount of games we have got and the size of the games we have got. \"first we have the fa cup third round, which is always a glitzy thing but in the month term is not the top priority so we have to manage as best we can to get the golden prize .\" if we beat villa on saturday that would be fantastic

thrill of the marlins' extra-inning win after blowing a four-run lead on friday night was the best outing of jacob turner's rookie season. the 21-year-old right-hander tossed six innings of two-run, four-hit ball while striking out three and walking just one. but with a predetermined pitch count falling somewhere between 80 and 85 pitches, turner's night ended at 81. considering the marlins have the 23rd-ranked bullpen era (4.08) in baseball, manager ozzie guillen's decision to pull turner seemed surprising--especially considering the pitch count wasn't revealed until after the game. \"i felt good, but obviously that's not my decision,\" turner said. \"i felt like i got stronger as the game went on .\" after the game, guillen said the front office will decide if turner pitches under a pitch count for the remainder of the season. acquired from the tigers in a late-july trade, turner is the marlins' third-ranked prospect according to mlb.com, and is considered one of the best pitching prospects in baseball, with a mid-90s sinker and poise on the mound. on the year, turner is 1-3 with a 6.44 era in 29 1/3 innings. with miami, he is 0-2 with a 5.29 era in 17 innings. \"we have to take care of everybody,\" guillen said. \"that's the reason we tried to stay away from him .\" washington--<mark>jose reyes</mark> added two triples in the marlins' 9-7 win over the nationals

three-base hit in the 10th scored ruggiano and bryan petersen, giving miami the go-ahead runs. \"in that situation, maybe i like [triples] better,\" <mark>reyes</mark> said. \"the last one was to put my team ahead, and that was good, because it's never easy against the nationals. they always find a way to fight back. we're just happy with a win .\" <mark>reyes</mark> is now 5-for-9 in extra innings this season, with a single, a double, two triples and a home run. according to elias sports bureau, the last major league player to have a season with an \"extra-inning cycle\" was the cubs' ryne sandberg in 1984. worth noting? on friday, the marlins named outfielder marcell ozuna their minor league player of the month and right-hander <mark>jose fernandez</mark> minor league pitcher of the month for august. at class a jupiter, ozuna batted .365 (38-for-104) with eight home runs and 32 rbis in 27 games last month. <mark>fernandez</mark>, also with jupiter, went 4-0 with an 0.72 era

and in some cases to earn money from selling carbon credits under the clean development mechanism established in 2001 as part of the kyoto protocol. the country now ranks second globally in terms of total land area under plantation. laurance says that much of india's claimed growth in forest cover has come from plantations, and that this is masking a fall in native forests. \"the indian government has made a big deal of increasing forest cover. but they are not distinguishing between natural and artificial forests,\" he says. a growing problem this is bad for the environment because replanting native forests with non-native trees damages local biodiversity, says <mark>neil burgess</mark>, a conservation biologist at the university of copenhagen. \"most plantations of non-native trees have very low biological value. they are only good to store carbon,\" he says. this distinction between native and non-native trees is important for an accurate picture of the state of the world's forests, says laurance. in the analysis, the researchers assessed data on the growth in indian plantations collected for the food and agricultural organization (fao) of the united nations. it estimates that plantations grew by around 15,400 square kilometres a year between 1995 and 2005. the researchers subtracted the rates of plantation expansion from the growth in total forest cover as measured by remote-sensing imagery, and found that coverage of native indian forests actually declined by 1.5-2 .7% between 1995 and 2005 - an \"alarming\" average of 2.4% a year and a loss of more than 124,000 square kilometres over the decade. the researchers checked these figures against changes in forest biovolume (the volume of wood and other above-ground forest material), estimated from field observations in the fsi report. they found a loss in native forest biovolume of around 2.7% per year. a resolution for change laurance says that some assessments of forest cover, such as that carried out by the fao, do not distinguish between native forests and plantations. they rely on relatively coarse data from sources including the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer satellites, which have a resolution of 1.1 square kilometres per pixel. but the indian remote sensing satellites used by the fsi have a much higher resolution - up to 23.5 square metres per pixel - so the agency has the means to distinguish native forests from plantations of non-native trees. laurance says he is hopeful that the united nations' redd + initiative to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation - which includes a focus on conservation and sustainable management of forests - will encourage india and other countries in similar situations to distinguish between native and artificial forests, and pay more attention to protecting the former. advertisement he says that countries such as norway - the programme's first and largest donor - will be interested more in paying to stop deforestation of native forests than in expanding plantations. bhaskar vira, an environmental economist at the university of cambridge, uk, says that he thinks \"there is probably some truth\" in the study's finding. but he warns that not all the trees planted each year reach maturity and show up in satellite imagery. because the authors subtracted the fao figures for the total area covered by plantations from a satellite-based estimate of total forest cover, the study may have overestimated the amount of deforestation taking place. laurance agrees that the data on plantations is \"rough\" , but points out that the calculations of loss in biovolume used forest survey of india data. the figures derived were similar to his estimates for deforestation, so he is confident in the results. references puyravaud, j.-p ., davidar, p. & laurance, <mark>w. f.</mark> conserv. lett. doi:10.1111 / j.1755-263x .2010.00141 (2010)."}, {"articleID": "2018120322_00308811_W", "names": {"Michael Cohen": ["Q16728129", "Q18038631", "Q1930523", "Q22277395", "Q28868110", "Q6829330", "Q6829331", "Q6829332", "Q6829335", "Q6829336"], "Roger Stone": ["Q19653753", "Q7358961"], "Mark Warner": ["Q14949474", "Q1617921", "Q21166633", "Q453893", "Q51299121", "Q6770231"], "David Weinstein": ["Q1177127", "Q1177128"]}, "date": "2018-12-03", "url": "http://wjtv.com/news/national/trump-praises-witness-who-refuses-to-testify-against-him/1637396094", "content": "Trump praises witness who refuses to testify against him By: Posted: Dec 03, 2018 04:29 PM CST Updated: Dec 03, 2018 04:29 PM CST WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump praised a key witness in the Russia investigation Monday for having the \"guts\" not to testify against him, and said his former lawyer - who cut a deal with prosecutors - should head straight to prison. In a pair of politically charged tweets, Trump made clear that he is closely watching those who turn on him in the special counsel's probe, which has ensnared some of the president's closest advisers. So far, five people in Trump's orbit have pleaded guilty to federal charges. The tweets add to mounting questions about whether Trump is taking steps to improperly influence witnesses in an investigation that has enraged him and shadowed his administration. Some legal experts, though, say they may not amount to witness tampering if Trump didn't directly tell others what to say or not say. Trump already has come under scrutiny from critics who fear he may use his executive power to protect himself as well as friends and supporters. Last week, Trump told the New York Post that a pardon for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was not off the table. Prosecutors say Manafort torpedoed his plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by repeatedly lying to them, although Manafort denies that he lied. In one of Monday's tweets, Trump took aim at <mark>Michael Cohen</mark>, his former personal attorney who once grandly declared he would \"take a bullet\" for the president but ultimately took a plea deal. <mark>Cohen</mark> pleaded guilty last week to lying to Congress about negotiations he had on Trump's behalf for a real estate deal in Moscow. Though he told lawmakers the talks were done by January 2016, he admitted they actually lasted as late as June - after Trump had clinched the Republican nomination and after Russians had penetrated Democratic email accounts for communications later released through WikiLeaks. <mark>Cohen</mark> said he lied out of loyalty to Trump, who insisted throughout the campaign that he had no business dealings in Russia, and to be consistent with his political messaging. On Monday, Trump ripped into <mark>Cohen</mark> on Twitter. \"You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term?\" Trump added that <mark>Cohen</mark> \"makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself .\" Trump added: \"He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence .\" Minutes later, Trump lavished praise on his former campaign adviser <mark>Roger Stone</mark>. Mueller's prosecutors are investigating <mark>Stone</mark> to learn whether he had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked material damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential effort. Trump lauded <mark>Stone</mark> for saying he'd never testify against the president. \"This statement was recently made by <mark>Roger Stone</mark>, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about\" President Trump,' \"he tweeted .\" Nice to know that some people still have \"guts!'\" <mark>Stone</mark> then posted a screenshot of Trump's tweet with a caption that said he was proud of their 40-year relationship and \"prouder still of the amazing job he is doing making America Great Again!\" Sen. <mark>Mark Warner</mark>, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Trump's tweet was inappropriate. \"The President of the United States should not be using his platform to influence potential witnesses in a federal investigation involving his campaign,\" <mark>Warner</mark> said in a tweet. <mark>Stone</mark> said the idea that Trump's tweet amount to witness tampering is \"hysterical .\" \"I'm not a witness to any proceeding,\" he said. <mark>David Weinstein</mark>, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Florida, said he was surprised by Trump's comments Monday, but didn't believe the tweets alone rose to the level of obstruction or witness tampering because Trump did not explicitly tell anyone what to say or not to say. Subjects of an investigation can still communicate to others entangled in a probe, and though they can encourage them to tell the truth, they cannot coach them to lie, he said. \"What he seems to be saying is that people who continue to show support for him, in some way, may be rewarded for that support,\" <mark>Weinstein</mark> said. \"I don't think it rises to the level of obstruction yet, but it certainly would cause people who are conducting the investigation to start asking questions about whether or not the target has reached out to them .\" Trump's message had an immediate effect on supporters. His remarks prompted Michael Caputo, the president's former campaign aide and a longtime <mark>Stone</mark> friend, to launch a \"GoFundMe\" account to help pay <mark>Stone</mark>'s mounting legal fees. <mark>Stone</mark> said he's paid about half a million in legal fees already and is projecting that total to reach $2 million. \"I require a small platoon of excellent lawyers and they're not inexpensive,\" he said. A conservative author, who is an associate of <mark>Stone</mark> and in the crosshairs of Mueller's investigation, filed a complaint Monday with the Justice Department, alleging prosecutors tried to coerce him to give false testimony and threatened to indict him. Investigators are looking into whether Jerome Corsi had contact with WikiLeaks or knew about their plans to release emails damaging to Clinton. Corsi has released documents showing Mueller's prosecutors offered him a deal to plead guilty to a false statements charge but he's rejected the offer. Corsi says he didn't knowingly mislead investigators and wasn't in contact with WikiLeaks. The Justice Department declined to comment on his complaint. The Russia investigation has dogged Trump for two years. In recent weeks, Trump has sharpened his criticism, accusing Mueller's prosecutors of dirty tactics and pressuring witnesses to lie. <mark>Cohen</mark>'s decision to turn on his former boss was a particularly striking blow for the president. <mark>Cohen</mark> pleaded guilty in August to eight criminal counts, including campaign-finance violations, in a separate case unrelated to Mueller's investigation. He said Trump directed him to arrange the payment of hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels and a former Playboy model in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. <mark>Cohen</mark>'s admission during that court appearance marked the first time that a Trump associate had gone to court and implicated Trump in a crime. Whether - or when - a president can be prosecuted remains a matter of legal dispute. Trump has denied any wrongdoing as well as the extramarital affairs. ___"}, {"articleID": "2015080903_00035832_W", "names": {"Liz Johnson": ["Q6660194", "Q6660196"]}, "date": "2015-08-09", "url": "http://cjonline.com/sports/bowling/2015-08-08/kuhlkin-sweeps-finals-claim-first-pwba-crown", "content": "The bowling lanes at the west end of West Ridge Lanes don't look any different to the untrained eye than the rest of the center's 32 lanes. But, oh, how wonderful they looked to 21-year-old <mark>Liz</mark> Kuhlkin on Saturday during the PWBA Topeka Open presented by Prairie Band Casino & Resort. Kuhlkin, of Schenectady, N.Y., used lanes 29 and 30 during two rounds of match play Saturday morning and afternoon to earn a berth in the stepladder finals, and then won three matches Saturday night on lanes 25 and 26 to claim her first PWBA title and a $10,000 prize. Kuhlkin's Korner, the west end should be called. \"I definitely was not upset when I heard the finals would be on the high (numbered) end of the house,\" Kuhlkin said. \"I don't think I had many games above 200 on the low end. But I still had a tough go ahead of me .\" Entering the finals as the No. 3 seed, Kuhlkin, a three-time NCAA All-American at Nebraska and a 2015 graduate, ousted Clara Guerrero, 224-205, and <mark>Liz Johnson</mark>, 247-202, before stopping top qualifier Danielle McEwan, 241-203, for the championship. \"It's just amazing,\" said Kuhlkin, the 2015 NCAA Division I Player of the Year and the fifth-place finisher at the USBC Queens in May. \"I actually made a goal for myself this week to make the top 16, and I exceeded that, and then I made the stepladder finals, and to win is just incredible .\" That would be a good way to describe Kuhlkin's performance on lanes 29 and 30 during the tournament. Kuhlkin capped the first round of match play Saturday with a perfect game to move into contention, and then shot 267 in the final, position-round game of the second match play session to move from fifth to third and make the TV show (streamed live on Xtra Frame). \"Honestly, it felt like I was bowling league, and it wasn't like that for anybody else,\" said Kuhlkin, who rolled a 243 game earlier on 29-30, which means she shot 810 on the pair overall. \"It just felt like I had the entire right side. As long as I kept it right, it struck. I struck light, I struck high, I tripped fours. It was fortunate that I drew that pair .\" While Kuhlkin was working toward a big finish, the 23-year-old McEwan, of Stony Point, N.Y., was dominating the field throughout most of the event. She led by 36 pins after 12 games of qualifying Friday, by 99 pins after the first round of match play Saturday and, after overcoming a slow start, by 107 pins at the end of match play. But after waiting through the first two matches Saturday night, and opening the championship game with a pair of strikes, McEwan failed to strike again on the lane 25. Kuhlkin, who took the lead by opening with four strikes, doubled in the sixth and seventh and ninth and 10th frames to seal the victory. \"It did not go as planned at all,\" said McEwan, who was a three-time NCAA All-American at Fairleigh Dickinson and the 2012 and 2013 NCAA Player of the Year. \"I'd planned on striking a lot more, which I did on one lane, but I couldn't figure out the other one .\" If anything, when I was practicing, I was actually more comfortable on the left lane, and then they kind of flip-flopped at the start of the (championship) game. \"<mark>Johnson</mark>, 41, of Cheektowaga, N.Y., charged into the stepladder finals by opening the second round of match play with games of 245, 212, 244, 238 and 236 (she average 227.38 for the round), but struggled on the championship lanes, striking only three times in her loss to Kuhlkin. Guerrero, 33, of Pflugerville, Texas, and an 18-year member of the national team in her native Colombia, held on to earn the last spot in the finals, but could only strike on the left lane. She succumbed when Kuhlkin strung strikes in frames four through nine. McEwan took home $5,000 for finishing second, while <mark>Johnson</mark> earned $3,500 and Guerrero $3,000.
