The 27-year-old caused some confusion last month after he appeared for Barca in a Liga match against Villarreal just two days after pulling out of the Spain squad for the games against France and Macedonia. He returned to the national team this week to play the full 90 minutes of Spain's defeat to Slovakia on Thursday and Sunday's 4-0 victory over Luxemburg but says that while his injury is improving, he is still suffering some minor discomfort. \"It's true that I had hip problems, and that is what I let Del Bosque know,\" he told AS. \"In fact, although I play with discomfort I am already much better. What happened was that <mark>Luis Enrique</mark>, who also knew about my situation, felt I was needed by the team to play against Villarreal .\" But I was being treated by the doctors, who prescribed me [the pain-killer] Voltaren, and during the international break I had to receive injections. \"Pique added that his surprise inclusion against Villarreal was simply down to differing opinions between his club and country coaches .\" They both knew how I was and what happened to my hip \", he said .\" [Spain coach Vicente] Del Bosque thought it was best to give me a rest and [Barcelona coach] <mark>Luis Enrique</mark> took the decision to make me play. \"My team needed me and I understood.

Check out the latest buzz below. Kobe Says Lakers Still Getting in Shape Kobe Bryant said after the rough 116-75 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday that the Lakers have been working hard and may have been worn down. \"Kobe says everyone has pretty heavy legs right now, says they've been practicing really hard,\" reported Lakers Nation Serena Winters. \"We practice really, really hard .\" But Kobe believes that the team will be fine once the regular season starts. \"We haven't started tapering down yet,\" he said, reported Lakers reporter Mike Trudell. \"T hinks guys will be more fresh ahead of the regular season. Focus now has been work,\" Trudell said, paraphrasing Bryant. Bryant also praised the Warriors, who he said are an excellent team. They got some phenomenal players over there-that's a problem for some of the top defensive teams in the league to deal with, \"he said. Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson makes a gesture after making a three-point shot against the Los Angeles Lakers during the first half of a preseason NBA basketball game, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2014, in Ontario, Calif. (AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) The Warriors have until October 31 to extend Klay Thompson. If not, he becomes a restricted free agent next summer. fan website claims that the Lakers will target Thompson if the contract talks don't work out. The Lakers have expressed interest in Thompson before. The shooting guard had Kobe raving after the first preseason game between the two, saying\" He has the whole package. \"And the Lakers tried to pull off a trade for Thompson earlier this year before the NBA draft. Los Angeles Times said that the Lakers wanted to deal the seventh pick in the draft, which became Julius Randle, for Thompson as part of a three-way trade that would have also involved the Minnesota Timberwolves and <mark>Kevin Love</mark>. The T'Wolves later traded <mark>Love</mark> to the Cleveland Cavaliers for multiple players. <mark>Nash</mark> Injured? <mark>Steve Nash</mark>, the oldest player in the NBA, informed coach Byron Scott that he didn't feel good on Sunday night. <mark>Nash</mark>, 40, asked Scott to take him out of the game .\" Byron Scott said <mark>Steve Nash</mark> told him he was done for the night, said he just didn't feel right, \"Winters said. <mark>Nash</mark>, like Bryant, has dealt with injuries over the last couple seasons. But both have been practicing hard and appeared to be ready for the season. The Lakers are getting thin at point guard, with Jordan Clarkson straining his calf and Jeremy Lin spraining his ankle recently. Both sat out the game against the Warriors, along with Xavier Henry, <mark>Ryan Kelly</mark>, <mark>Ed Davis</mark>, and <mark>Nick Young</mark>. Ronnie Price and Keith Appling are the other point guards currently on the roster. Clarkson will be out until Friday, at least.

(Jeff Gross/Getty Images) Lin sprained an ankle at practice on Saturday, and will be evaluated again soon .\" He got up and kind of walked out on his own, but he was in a little pain, \"Scott said, reported the Los Angeles Times. Lin had replaced <mark>Nash</mark> in Thursday's loss to the Warriors, scoring 14 points and adding four assists in 21 minutes. Some believe that Lin should be starting over <mark>Nash</mark>, but it may come to whichever guard is in better condition to start the season .\" In early exhibition you want to see as many guys as you can, \"Scott said .\" Unfortunately for Jeremy, and obviously for <mark>Nick</mark>, it gives other guys an opportunity. \"Scott said that Lin should be ready to play on Thursday against the Utah Jazz. reported ESPN .\" But today he was walking a little gingerly and did some more treatment today. \"Prediction Has Lakers Missing Playoffs A number of season predictions have been coming out and the latest has the Lakers missing the playoffs .\" If everything were to go perfectly for the Lakers this season, it would still be tough to envision a win total of more than 45 games - and even then, that probably wouldn't be enough to reach the postseason in a traditionally loaded Western Conference, \"reported NBC .\" What's far more likely is that Bryant and <mark>Nash</mark> miss time at some point due to injury (whether major or minor), and that the roster simply doesn't have enough from a talent perspective to be able to compete on a nightly basis. A total of 35 wins and another trip to the Draft Lottery feels about right. \"The Lakers have high hopes after acquiring a number of new players, including Lin, Carlos Boozer, and Julius Randle, but will have trouble making it to the playoffs.", "articleID": "2014101318_00005100_W", "names": {"Ed Davis": ["Q1282320", "Q26858558", "Q5334728"], "Kevin Love": ["Q297221", "Q6396801"], "Nick Young": ["Q14949301", "Q28531164", "Q7028182", "Q703908"], "Ray Allen": ["Q208623", "Q2438891"], "Ryan Kelly": ["Q13605944", "Q20641855", "Q20713861", "Q22005766", "Q33744353", "Q7384209", "Q7384212"], "Steve Nash": ["Q16137022", "Q192955", "Q42316961"]}}, {"date": "2014-10-14", "url": "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/10/live_report_princeton_discusses_towns_first_post-consolidation_audit.html", "content": "Set Your Location (Enter City and State or Zip Code) Congratulations! Your weather is set to comments Live report: Princeton discusses town's first post-consolidation audit PRINCETON - Council is discussing the town's first post-consolidation audit, with a \"corrective action\" resolution on the agenda to address recommendations. The former Princeton borough and township officially consolidated on Jan. 1, 2013. \"Given the complication of bringing two municipalities together, I'm pleased with the results of that audit,\" Mayor Liz Lempert said Monday afternoon. \"There are some items on there in the corrective action plan that will be adopted .\" The audit was conducted by Hodulik & <mark>Morrison</mark> of Highland Park. One recommendation is that the financial accounting software budget module's data entry privileges be reviewed and modified to limit the ability to override controls to authorized personnel. In response to that recommendation, the town said new finance software is in place to limit the ability to override system controls to Kathy Monzo, director of finance, and Sandra Webb, chief financial officer, according to the corrective action resolution. Another recommendation included making sure reports of credit card payments of parking costs be obtained and checked against amounts paid by the card companies to assure all parking revenues are received timely. Princeton said software changes were made at the Bank of America, and \"this is an on-going issue that we are still attempting to resolve,\" according to the resolution. mandatory quarantine issued Friday by state health officials for members of an NBC crew - which includes Princeton resident Dr. Nancy Snyderman - that was exposed to Ebola.
