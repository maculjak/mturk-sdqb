Doctors and nurses will show pupils how to stem bleeding, keep victims alive in the first crucial minutes after an attack, and keep themselves safe. The \"zero responder\" workshops were first run at Feltham and Pentonville young offender institutions by A & E specialists from the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel last autumn. Since then, the two-hour sessions have also been held at youth and community centres in Hackney and Southwark. This term the Barts Health Trust specialists will launch the workshops in London schools for the first time. Read more Two killed in 15 minutes: Mum stabbed and man shot yards apart They will run them in four east London pupil referral units--education centres for children who have been removed from mainstream school--this autumn, with the aim of expanding into mainstream schools. Experts will use simulation and practical exercises to teach groups of about 15 to 20 pupils, who will be able to ask questions. Michael Carver, lead violence reduction nurse at the Royal London, said he wanted to give first aid to all pupils, adding: \"The primary outcome is they will be able to do first-responder things to stop people bleeding to death in the first five minutes; and the secondary outcome is we start talking properly about knife crime .\" The move is part of a Barts Health violence reduction initiative, running alongside a NHS programme to tackle youth violence in the capital, led by its first clinical director for violence reduction, Royal London trauma surgeon <mark>Martin Griffiths</mark>.

But now Star Magazine is able to confirm that even if the two aren't officially dating, they're at least making out, because they up and got some pictures of it. And in addition, another source says they saw Benji and Cameron having breakfast with a group of six people at ABC Kitchen in Manhattan:\" Throughout the entire meal, Cameron and Benji couldn't keep their hands off each other. They were whispering to each other and laughing, just having the best time together. \"Well this sounds pretty cute, actually. And for anyone who's wondering how they met, it was apparently through Cameron's friend Nicole Richie, who as you may recall is married to Benji's brother and Good Charlotte bandmate, Joel Madden .\" Everyone else at the table was talking and catching up, but Benji and Cameron were completely removed from the conversation. They were totally consumed with each other. Benji kept his arm around her, and she'd just rest her head on his shoulder and stare at him, grinning. It was obvious that she's crazy about him. \", and <mark>Alex Rodriguez</mark>, so Benji isn't someone I'd expect to be her type. What are they feeding those Madden boys that they're able to pull dime pieces like Cameron and Nicole?

The film tells the story of Michael Cleveland, an iconic and sought-after fiddle player who has overcome great personal hardship to become one of Bluegrass music's most revered instrumentalists. Cleveland is the International Bluegrass Music Association's 11-time, most-awarded, Fiddle Player of the Year, and he has won Instrumental Recorded Performance of the Year six times. Cleveland also fronts the 5-time Instrumental Group of the Year, Michael Cleveland & Flamekeeper, which he founded in 2006. Cleveland was born blind and with a cleft palate, and in early childhood lost 80% of the hearing in his left ear. In spite of physical challenges, he undertook a musical career undeterred and has ascended to the highest possible echelons of his genre. Director John Presley brings his expert eye and heart for storytelling to the project. The film, while visually engaging, was also designed with Cleveland himself in mind. \"I learned that our visually impaired friends see the world in an entirely different way,\" says Presley. \"One of my goals was to create a film that Michael would be able to experience and enjoy through sound alone .\" Years of commercial and short film work, along with his experience as a musician, led the director on a journey to uncover how Cleveland became the artist--and person--he is today. \"I have felt deeply honored to tell his inspirational story and present his talent to new audiences around the world,\" says Presley. \"When I was first approached about the idea of a documentary film about me, I was definitely surprised, and it still seems so surreal,\" adds Cleveland. \"For as long as I've been playing music professionally, I have made it a point to keep the focus on the music and not the fact that I am visually impaired. I decided that if I was going to have a career in music, I wanted to make it on my abilities as a musician and not the fact that I was blind. After I talked to John and took a few days to think it over and run it by my family and the rest of the Flamekeeper team, I realized that this could be an inspiration to some young kid somewhere with a dream that looks as impossible as it seemed to me when I was growing up and dreaming of a career in music .\" Flamekeeper features interviews with 14-time Grammy Award winner Bela Fleck and 21-time Grammy Award winner Vince Gill, who says of Cleveland, \"It's wicked to see how much music he pulls out of a bow--He's untouchable .\" Also appearing in the film are such music notables as Sam Bush, Jens Kruger, <mark>Jeff White</mark>, the Bibelhauser Brothers and Andy Statman. The evening was hosted by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's <mark>Peter Cooper</mark> and was attended by a who's who of bluegrass icons including Fleck, Bush, Gill, Ricky Skaggs, The Whites, <mark>Jeff White</mark>, Becky Buller, and others. Flamekeeper was produced by Validate Films and is Presley's first feature-length documentary film. Presley was joined on the project by co-producer Cortlandt Ingram, a familiar name in the bluegrass world. After winning over one hundred fiddle contests early in his career, Ingram founded a company providing audio and lighting resources for events across the nation. Ingram's knowledge of the bluegrass genre was an invaluable asset to the film's production. Flamekeeper will be released globally to audiences online through Amazon and other streaming platforms on March 1. For more information visit FlamekeeperFilm.com. Share Tweet"}]
