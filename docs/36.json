BECK Associated Press August 2, 2019--7:10 pm Purchase: Order Reprint OMAHA, Neb.--Hopes by a small aviation museum in southwestern Iowa that a stamp in its possession was rare enough to parlay a potential fortune crashed Friday when experts told them it wasn't real, and likely not even worth the paper it was glued upon. The Iowa Aviation Museum in Greenfield, Iowa, has had what it thought was a 1918\" Inverted Jenny \"stamp on public display for some 20 years, dating back to when it was donated to the museum, glued to a board along with several other stamps. A notation from the donor attached to the board speculated then that it was worth about $73,000. Experts at the national stamp convention meeting in Omaha knew immediately the stamp wasn't authentic, said <mark>Ken Martin</mark> with the American Philatelic Society that's holding the show through Sunday.\" It wasn't the right size. It was too small, \"<mark>Martin</mark> said.\" This version was likely cut out of a postage stamp auction catalog. \"An examination under a microscope confirmed experts' initial doubt. A 100-year-old stamp would have been printed from an artist's engraving, so the image under a microscope would appear as a series of lines. A reproduction for printed material decades later would have been comprised of a series of tiny dots, which is what appeared under the scope, <mark>Martin</mark> said. The news was disappointing for those at the museum, which also serves as the home of the Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame and had hoped to auction the stamp for hundreds of thousands of dollars and build a new museum hangar.\" We really didn't know what we had, \"Larry Konz, a tour guide at the museum, said Friday.\" When we were told that we might have the real deal, I thought, \"My God, we might have something quite valuable here, and we've had it hanging on a wall all this time.\" Had it been real, it would be worth between $300,000 and $400,000 at auction, <mark>Martin</mark> said. There were only 100 of the stamps printed in 1918, with the image of a JN-4-H \"Jenny\" biplane accidentally displayed upside-down on a 24-cent stamp. Norma Nielson, of Eugene, Oregon, was at the convention Friday to see for herself if the museum was in possession of one of the few rare and unaccounted stamps. Nielson is a stamp collector who grew up in the museum's hometown of Greenfield, and had put museum officials in touch with the American Philatelic Society to check the stamp's authenticity. \"I knew it was probably a slim chance of it being genuine, given how rare that stamp is,\" she said. \"But, boy, it sure would have been exciting if it had been.\" More from Star Tribune"}, {"articleID": "2019020114_00698689_W", "names": {"Harry Shum": ["Q16905622", "Q348649"]}, "date": "2019-02-01", "url": "http://www.tvguide.com/news/shadowhunters-season-3b-everything-we-know-so-far/?rss=breakingnews", "content": "Share on WhatsApp It's been a long hiatus, hasn't it, fans? Shadowhunters The return of all of our favorite Shadowhunters, Downworlders and Mundanes is just around the corner, and we're just as eager as you are to find out if Clary (Katherine McNamara) is actually dead--yeah right--how Magnus (<mark>Harry Shum</mark> Jr.) will be coping with the loss of his powers, and how this epic series will begin to wrap itself up as enter the final stretch. To help keep track of the madness to come, TV Guide has compiled everything we know about Season 3B so far! It returns Monday, Feb. 25 at 8/7c on Freeform. We had to wait a while (OK, a lot longer than a while), but we finally have a date for the return of Shadowhunters Season 3. The show will be back on Mondays for the final 10 episodes of Season 3, and we'll get an additional 2-hour series finale too. Clary is still around...somehow. Though Clary seemed to meet her pretty nasty demise in the midseason finale last year, Katherine McNamara was obviously still filming for 3B and the 2-hour series finale. Whether she's been blasted to another dimension or she's a ghost/dream/hallucination, you can rest assured that Clary will be back. Executive producer Todd Slavkin told TV Guide that her story in 3B is \"a really cool spin on the books,\" so take that as you will. Subscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Google Play / iHeartRadio / TuneIn The first episode back will be a bit of a downer. While we know Clary's fate is probably not as bleak as it's been made out to be, her friends from the Shadow World aren't so lucky. Darren Swimmer called the first episode \"emotional as hell\" as Clary's friends reflect back on her life and what she meant to them. Magnus (<mark>Harry Shum</mark> Jr.) will have to learn how to live without magic. While Magnus learning to live without his powers could provide some opportunities for positive growth, but it's also going to be a tough struggle, particularly when it comes to his own mortality. Malec could have some \"heartbreaking\" times ahead. Predictably, Magnus giving up his magic in order to save Alec's (Matthew Daddario) Parabatai, Jace (Dominic Sherwood) is a pretty monumental thing to happen in and to their relationship. Slavkin has told us to expect the Malec relationship to evolve in a really \"interesting, heartbreaking, beautiful way.\" Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now! We'll finally get answers about the Mark of Cain. When the Seelie Queen burned that freaky symbol into Simon's (Alberto Rosende) forehead last year, we had so many questions about what it was, why she did it and what it means for Simon. We'll be getting a lot of those answers in the first three episodes of 3B, and we've been assured it will all make sense in time. Luke Baines will take over the role of Jonathan Morgenstern. Before her loft exploded, Lillith (Anna Hopkins) did achieve her goal of bringing her son, Jonathan, back to life. Gooey as he was, we did see that arm rise out of the casket and grab Clary. Seeing as he's been \"remade\" though, he won't look like Sebastien Verlac (Will Tudor), the form he took when we first met him. This time around, he'll wear his true face, which will look a whole lot like Luke Baines.
