Watch the video It was precisely this sort of suggestion during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting on Tuesday featuring former Defense Department and CIA Chief of Staff Jeremy Bash and national security adviser and U.S. Ambassador James Jeffrey, that seemed to incense committee member Sen. Paul. RELATED: Why is Rand Paul the only Republican who knows our foreign policy is crazy? The senator vehemently rejected sending American troops to Syria, \"I' d like to go on record as saying that it would be a really rotten, no good, bad idea to have ground troops in Syria, and very naive to think you' re going to put 1000 troops in there, and everybody' s going to welcome us .\" Paul continued, \"It' s very presumptuous to think that we' re going to decide who takes Raqqa and who occupies Raqqa. Don' t you think the people there would be aghast, to think we' re 3000 miles away, to decide who' s going to take over Raqqa and who' s going to occupy it?\" \"We can win any battle,\" Paul said. \"But when we big we usually go big, and sort of, there have been many people--the Powell Doctrine--go big or don' t go. 1000 soldiers?\" Paul inquired, appearing to note that this number would not be enough should the U.S. decide to escalate our military efforts in Syria. A year ago during the campaign, <mark>Donald Trump</mark> said he would consider sending up to 30,000 U.S. troops to Syria. Yet <mark>Trump</mark> also has stressed that the U.S. should get out of the business of nation building. Those two foreign policy views don' t typically jibe. Paul addressed to the committee how sending troops abroad inevitably leads to nation building. \"And then the other problem [...] The mantra is always\" Stay, stay, we must stay forever,' and if we leave, that' s our fault for leaving, \"Paul said .\" There' s no exit from a situation like this \"the senator said .\" Let' s say we were to go in and defeat those who were there, to defeat ISIS--do you think that' s the end? No, when a big force comes, they' re going to shrink away, and they will fight' til the end of time. \"\"And they will fight against an American target if Americans are the target,\" Paul said. Watching the 2016 presidential primaries where most Republican candidates seemed eager to commit American troops abroad, with the exception of Paul and in some ways <mark>Trump</mark>, I wrote, \"Our foreign policy is run by crazy people. I don't mean legitimately insane, but politicians who insist America must do things around the world that have been empirically proven not to work--for decades--at great cost to our country's finances, military, prestige and actual security .\" It remains true: We go out of our way to make other nation' s wars our own, usually to our own detriment. Paul said Tuesday, \"This is a war within Islam, and I think we should be supportive and try to amplify those who are trying to defeat this aberration .\" \"But let' s don' t make it our war,\" he said. The Republican senator from Kentucky then ran down all of the other forces that could be part of anti-ISIS efforts in the region instead of the U.S. always having to take the lead. \"Look, there are 200,000 Peshmerga. There are 200,000 Iraq soldiers. There' s a hundred and some odd thousand in the Syrian army. There are 600,000 in the Turks',\" Paul said, \"and there are 15,000 ISIS, and we have to go over there to defeat them?\" RELATED: No, <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, torture doesn't work, and we're not going down that road again <mark>Donald Trump</mark> won the election saying sane things about the futility of the Iraq war and the folly of nation building, combined with some less sane and belligerent things. But at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing this week, we were reminded that among the nation' s entrenched foreign policy elite, nothing has really changed. They still possess the same interventionist mentality. The only person on that committee who seemed to outraged over the idea of sending 1000 Americans men and women to Syria--particularly based on everything we have learned about ill-advised interventions from the Iraq war forward--was Sen. Paul. \"I think we ought to think this thing through and think that this won' t be the end, this will be the beginning,\" Paul said. \"And I guarantee you the voices are loud and strong. Everybody says we should have stayed in Iraq. Everybody is still saying we should stay in Afghanistan .\" \"Are we going to stay everywhere? Forever?\" Sen. Paul asked.

The Utes controlled the glass. They forced turnovers, swiping the ball frequently to set up easy transition baskets for 40 minutes. Utah's 79-54 victory on Thursday night offered the Antelopes a glimpse at what life will be like as a Division I newcomer. Delon Wright scored 17 points on 8-of-8 shooting while Jordan Loveridge added 15 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Utes (3-0) as they opened the Global Sports Hoops Showcase. Utah used its speed and size to take control of the game from the opening tip. How dominant were the Utes? Utah owned Grand Canyon around the basket. The Utes had a 49-33 edge on rebounds and a 42-28 advantage in points in the paint. When the Antelopes made any mistakes, Utah made them pay quickly. The Utes produced 20 points off 12 Grand Canyon turnovers. Utah also outscored the Antelopes 17-2 in fastbreak points. \"I want our identity built off of our defense - getting stops and knowing the game becomes easier heading the other direction if we can do that,\" Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said. \"Our guys have been really locked in to guard. We can't be the type of team that has to see the ball go in to the basket in order to get energized .\" Demetrius Walker had 16 points and Jerome Garrison added 12 to lead the Antelopes, who are still searching for their first win over a Division I opponent. Grand Canyon (1-3) joined the WAC this season after competing in the Pac West - an NCAA Division II conference - last season. After 40 minutes against Utah, there are plenty of miles yet to travel on the road to fully making the transition to Division I. \"This is a level that we aren't at yet,\" Grand Canyon coach Dan Majerle said. \"It's where we strive to be. Going from Division II to Division I we knew was going to be a challenge. Our guys played a little scared and they have to get over that. We have to learn from that and move on .\" Points for Grand Canyon occurred as often as a desert rainstorm in the first half. The Antelopes missed seven straight shots to open the game and did not get their first basket until five minutes into the game. They shot only 28 percent from the field and 10 percent from 3-point range before halftime. Utah wasted no time taking advantage. The Utes opened the game on an 11-0 run - capped by a three-point play from Jordan Loveridge - and hit 5 of 7 baskets during the same stretch where Grand Canyon could not score at all. \"It started on the defensive end,\" Loveridge said. \"We got some stops and then it just made our offense easier. That's how we got up. We were just outplaying them on the defensive end and it made our offense that much easier .\" Grand Canyon whittled the lead down to six when Jeremy Adams scored a layup to cut Utah's lead to 15-9. But that brief comeback simply set the stage for another 11-0 spurt for the Ute offense. A layup from Wright gave Utah a double-digit lead again. Dakari Tucker finished off the run with back-to-back 3-pointers, giving the Utes a 30-12 lead with 5:43 remaining before halftime. The Antelopes managed to trim the lead a little bit before halftime and continued to cut into it coming out of the locker room. Grand Canyon rallied within 12 points, making it 40-28 on a layup from Killian Larson. \"They did a good job of guarding us,\" Krystkowiak said. \"Put some heat on us that we've haven't felt in weeks in terms of trying to take us out of things .\" Utah did not let the Antelopes get any closer. Jeremy Olsen scored layups on back-to-back possessions to spark a 13-2 run. Wright finished off the run with a three-point play, giving Utah a 53-30 lead with 12:00 minutes left in the game. Grand Canyon had one final run left. The Antelopes went on a 10-2 spurt, cutting it to 55-40 on a <mark>Blake Davis</mark> 3-pointer. Utah ended slammed the door shut on any comeback by answering with an 8-0 run. Van Dyke drained a pair of free throws to cap the spurt and give the Utes a 63-40 lead with 7:15 remaining. The Global Sports Hoops Showcase continues Friday with Grand Canyon facing Savannah State and Utah hosting Lamar."}, {"articleID": "2014101716_00039570_W", "names": {"Santosh Anand": ["Q15696890", "Q56994518"]}, "date": "2014-10-17", "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/news/sci-tech/3-wild-bears-found-dead-in-odisha_1486268.html", "content": "Berhampur: Three wild bears were today found dead at Somanathapalli village in Ganjam district, about 90-km from here. Forest officials recovered the carcass of an adult female bear of about 20-year-old and its two male cubs, around two-and-half-year of age on the outskirts of the village located in the vicinity of a reserve forest. \"The animal bodies are decomposed. We suspected they died on Wednesday. The death of the animals, however, came to our notice today,\" said forest ranger Sarat Chandra Mishra. Though the exact reason of the death of the wild bears was not known, the forest officials suspected that the animals might have died either due to the electrocution or poisoning, he said. Local veterinary doctors conducted the post-mortem. Since the death of the bears was surrounded in mystery, the veterinary doctors also taken the viscera of animal for laboratory test, he said.

Metro Performance Glass lowers FY guidance, suspends dividends to bring down debt By Rebecca Howard Nov. 26 (BusinessDesk)--Metro Performance Glass reported a 22 percent drop in half-year net profit, lowered its full-year guidance and said it won't be paying any dividends as it struggles to turn around its Australian business. The company provided no further details of a new competitor looking to build a new glass processing plant near Hamilton that it alerted the market of earlier this month. New Zealand's biggest glass processor said its half-year net profit in the six months to Sept. 30 was $9.1 million versus $11.8 million a year earlier. Revenue was down 1 percent at $140.5 million while earnings before interest and taxation were down 18 percent at $15.5 million. The result was impacted by poor trading results in Australia, it said. Metro Glass said its New Zealand business--with the exception of Canterbury--remains supported by elevated levels of residential and non-residential construction and revenue was 1 percent higher at $113 million. The Australian business, Australian Glass Group, remains challenging, it said. Revenue was down 7.1 percent and ebit was a loss of $1.3 million versus earnings of $2.6 million a year earlier. \"The market is supportive and the recent capital investment programme is showing promise on lifting production capacity and improving manufacturing efficiency. However, it is taking longer than originally planned to reset AGG's operations, people and culture. This has impacted its year-to-date financial performance and highlighted further capability gaps we are working to address,\" said chairman <mark>Peter Griffiths</mark>. \"We are focused on stabilising AGG's performance in the second half of the year and returning the business to profitable growth in FY20,\" said <mark>Griffiths</mark>. Given the challenges in Australia, it now expects group ebit of around $28 million, down from the guidance it gave at its annual general meeting when it said ebit would be at the lower end of its target range of $30million - $33 million. The board has also reviewed the group's leverage and dividend policy against its current operating performance, its longterm strategy, the uncertain future competitive landscape, and expectations of how the Australasian building cycles could evolve in the coming years, said <mark>Griffiths</mark>. \"As a result, it will declare no further dividends until the group's leverage ratio, as measured by net debt to rolling 12month ebitda, is reduced to approximately 1.5 times. At 30 September 2018, this ratio was 2.3 times,\" it said. Net debt stood at $95.2 million. The stock last traded at 53 cents and is down 44 percent over the past 12 months. The shares plunged 24 percent earlier this month after it reported on its expected new rival's plans to have its new Hamilton plant coming on stream in mid-2020.

a business it eventually sold in 2005, to lenovo, a chinese company. over the years ibm had produced servers, retail store systems, storage devices, and printers in shenzhen: first for overseas markets, and later, increasingly for the chinese market. it had seen massive supply networks develop in the pearl river delta. some suppliers made parts for toys, sports shoes, and other low-end products; others made components for sophisticated computing and telecommunications equipment. still others provided logistics and supporting technology. ibm had also seen the chinese government invest in business-friendly infrastructure: economic zones, industrial parks, highways and container ports, universities and training colleges. by locating its global procurement headquarters in shenzhen, ibm was not only strengthening its own supply base, but better positioning one of its core businesses: helping clients strengthen their supply chains. the company has also invested in r & d in china. its china research laboratory, one of eight flagship ibm labs around the world, is located in zhongguancun software park, next to beijing's main university district. most of its more than 150 researchers hold doctorates or master's degrees from beijing, tsinghua, or other leading chinese universities. the lab specializes in speech and language technologies, cross-border e-business solutions, and pervasive computing, which is the embedding of microprocessors in everyday objects. ibm opened another lab in shanghai in 2008. in consulting, despite the global economic slowdown, ibm has been on a growth trajectory, doubling its business in 2009 because of chinese demand. it plans to open four new offices in china, taking its total presence from six to 10. moreover, ibm runs all its global growth businesses from shanghai. this includes its businesses in asia, latin america, russia, eastern europe, the middle east, and africa. in short, ibm's presence in china is very different from what might have been envisioned a few years ago. it is defined not by an expanding consumer population or by low-wage labor, but by the integration of chinese activity with its worldwide enterprise. like a growing number of other companies - coca-cola, honeywell, kfc, and goodyear among the most prominent - ibm has a \"one world\" - oriented strategy for its operations in china. in addition to sourcing products in china and seeking out chinese markets, it is investing dramatically in operations there and integrating them with the rest of ibm's global enterprise. the benefits of a one-world strategy in china have become obvious, and a growing number of multinational companies - or \"foreign\" companies, as the chinese think of them - are ready to increase their presence. they may already market to some chinese consumers, or draw from the country's labor pool, or outsource manufacturing there, but now they want more. china's rapid recovery from the global recession, bolstered by its reorganized banking sector and its emerging middle class, has attracted many companies to the chinese economy. as resources american chamber of commerce in shanghai and booz & company, \"china manufacturing competitiveness 2008-2009,\" 2009: research on the evolving capabilities and interests of manufacturers in china. andrew cainey, suvojoy sengupta, and steven veldhoen, \"capturing the asian opportunity,\" s + b, winter 2009: why economic recovery in china, india, and elsewhere in the region could be the strongest source of sustained global growth for years to come. patrick chovanec, \"the nine nations of china,\" the atlantic, november 2009: the further differentiation of china, its culture, and its prospects for development and change. anil k. gupta and <mark>haiyan wang</mark>, getting china and india right: strategies for leveraging the world's fastest-growing economies for global advantage (jossey-bass, 2009): how to go beyond simplistic, premium-based marketing in both global economies. warren liu, kfc in china: secret recipe for success (wiley, 2008): the inside story of the success in china of kfc and its subsidiary yum brands. sam palmisano, \"the globally integrated enterprise,\" foreign affairs, may/june 2006: the chairman and ceo of ibm explains how the corporation is evolving from \"multinational\" to \"global\" enterprise. edward tse, the china strategy: harnessing the power of the world's fastest-growing economy (basic books, 2010): an overall, in-depth guide to the vision, versatility, and vigilance demonstrated by successful companies in china today. china's five surprises, \"s + b, winter 2005: this article explained china's entrepreneurial intensity, fearless experimentation,\" brain gain, \"transition away from patronage, and overseas ambition. context and complexity,\" s + b, autumn 2007: more examples of the flexible approach needed for china's increasingly diverse market. shan zhai companies, once associated with pirated goods, have become competitive players, even in mature industries. for more thought leadership on this topic, see the"}, {"articleID": "2019072620_00003928_W", "names": {"Stephen Fowler": ["Q39415168", "Q7609726"]}, "date": "2019-07-26", "url": "http://www.gattonstar.com.au/news/teen-fugitives-leave-police-in-dust/3790482/", "content": "The tiny and remote town of Gillam has been taken over by an army of police hunting for murder spree suspects Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod.

Now fears are growing that Canadian highway murder spree suspects Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19, may no longer be hiding in dense bushland surrounding the tiny and remote community of Gillam, in northern Manitoba, where authorities have been searching for two days.

An army of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), along with reinforcements from as far afield as Alberta and Ontario, descended on the one-road town of just 1,200 people after the teens torched their last known getaway car at a nearby First Nations reserve on Monday. An Emergency Response Team, Crisis Negotiation Team, the RCMP Major Crime Unit and additional district resources have been deployed to the district, police said. They have received more than 80 tips and asked the public to stay away from the pair if spotted. It comes as heavy rain hampers the search for the suspected killers.

But despite authorities' claims McLeod and Schmegelsky had effectively trapped themselves in the vast swathe of heavily forested, bear and insect-infested swampland that encircles Gillam, there are other ways out besides the single, 300km stretch of road that connects it to the rest of Manitoba. \"There's a CN (Canadian National Railway) line that passes through Gillam and right past where the burnt Rav4 was found,\" Canadian archaeologist Tyler Cantwell told news.com. au in a message. \"My pure speculation - but it's what I would do - is that they hopped on the back of a train and headed back West .\" Others say the Schmegelsky and McLeod could have jumped on a train to Churchill - a port on Hudson Bay known as the Polar Bear Capital of the World and, to a lesser extent, the Beluga Whale Capital of the World. The port is around 270km from Gillam and popular with tourists, who flock to the pristine harbour to join whale and bear spotting boat and air tours. If the suspects make it that far, they could easily steal a boat or another car. The ever present threat of polar bears means that locals never lock their vehicles. Authorities advise anyone under attack to jump into the nearest car and shut themselves inside. CCTV vision of Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, in Saskatchewan.

However, a rail line runs right past the spot where the fugitives dumped their last known getaway car. Picture: Supplied DID THE TEENS PULL OFF ANOTHER CARJACKING? The murderous trail of destruction has played out in terrain so isolated there is often no internet or phone coverage, with some areas in northern Manitoba unable to even access 911. As a result, sightings of the pair have been 24 to 48 hours old by the time they are communicated, allowing the suspects to stay several steps ahead of authorities. There are also unconfirmed reports the teens are travelling in a car with Manitoba number plates stolen from a Gillam man and speculation they may have even been involved in a suspected abduction and carjacking in Regina, Saskatchewan on Tuesday. The carjacking took place 15 hours after the Rav4 was found ditched at Gillam - which is a 13 1/2 hour drive from Regina. \"Officers were sent to a parking lot in the 400 block of Albert Street where a person had been abducted at gunpoint just after noon,\" Regina Police said in a statement. \"A vehicle pulled into the parking lot followed by a small black car. A person got out of the black car with what appeared to be a gun and pointed it at the driver of the first car .\" The driver was forced into the black car with the suspect. Both cars then drove away. No shots were fired. A black car or smaller SUV with four doors and a roof rack was involved in this incident. \"Only one of the teens, McLeod, can reportedly drive but a scenario involving Schmegelsky forcing a motorist to drive at gunpoint with McLeod at the wheel of a second car is not beyond the realms of possibility. An appeal has been made to the public for information regarding the vehicle, its owner or occupants and CCTV footage released .\" Police believe there are at least two suspects involved in this incident, which does not appear to be a random act \"at this time' .\" A local newspaper reported the RCMP did not believe the incident was linked to McLeod and Schmegelsky's alleged murder spree but observers have pointed out the RCMP initially failed to link the teens to the two crime scenes or the crime scenes to each other. Others have speculated police are withholding information from the public to prevent tipping the suspects off. On Friday, police said they had confirmed two sightings of the teens in the area since Monday but said no reports of stolen cars were linked to them. This happened tues morning about 15 hrs after they torched the car in Gillam, enough time to get there. They were announced as suspects tuesday morning as well.

A fleet of armoured SWAT team trucks set off for Gillam on Thursday afternoon to join the search. Hundreds of officers, equipped with police dogs, drones and other high tech surveillance equipment, have been combing the hostile scrub for clues to the teens' whereabouts. The father of Schmegelsky, Alan, said the pair had been \"training in war\" in the woods and were masters of camouflage. But even as the reinforcements were being called in, there was an unconfirmed sighting of McLeod and Schmegelsky at Split Lake, some 85km north of the current search area. Petrol station worker Michelle Keeper told CBC News she believes she served the pair on Monday at about 4pm. It was not clear what vehicle they were travelling in at the time or whether the encounter happened before or after SUV was found dumped at Gillam. Ms Keeper said McLeod paid for $20 worth of fuel and Schmegelsky asked if they could consume alcohol in the First Nations community, which is dry. \"The guy who paid for the gas - he was quiet, he didn't say anything, he was just looking down,\" she told CBC. \"They seemed like, I don't know, normal. I'm just so nervous right now thinking about it .\" Ms Keeper said she didn't realise she had served the fugitives until she saw the RCMP's updated suspect photographs the following day. She said McLeod was still sporting a short beard and Schmegelsky was wearing the same camouflaged shirt seen in the police alert.

Picture: Supplied Lucas <mark>Fowler</mark> and Chynna Deese were very much in love. Picture: The Charlotte Observer/via Deese family The teens have been charged with one count of second degree murder in the death of University of British Columbia lecturer Leonard Dyck and are suspects in the murders of Mr <mark>Fowler</mark> and Ms Deese. The couple were found dead alongside their campervan on the Alaska Highway in British Columbia on July 15. They had been travelling through northern British Columbia en route to Alaska on what was meant to be a dream roadtrip. On July 19, the body of Mr Dyck, a botanist, was discovered almost 500km away on Highway 37 - two km from the abandoned and burning wreckage of McLeod and Schmegelsky's Dodge pick-up truck. Authorities initially failed to link the three incidents, classifying the teens as missing persons up until Tuesday, when they were officially named suspects in the three murders. The teens, who have been inseparable since primary school, have eluded capture ever since, leading police on a 3000-plus km chase across three provinces and up into the wilderness of northern Manitoba.
