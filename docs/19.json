fugitive u.s. marshal has been found in the city of juarez, mexico, according to the u.s. marshals service-the latest discovery in a wave of violence that has gripped towns along the u.s.-mexican border in recent months. the body of deputy marshal vincent bustamante-who faced federal charges of stealing weapons and other government property-was found in juarez on wednesday, said marshals service spokesman <mark>jeff carter</mark>. bustamante appeared to have been shot in the back of the head, a federal law enforcement source said. chihuahua state police said the body had multiple wounds to the head-apparently consistent with an execution-style shooting, according to edgar roman, a reporter with xhij television in juarez. bustamante, 48, was charged with stealing u.s. government property including glock and ruger handguns, a shotgun and a pair of binoculars, according to court documents. according to the federal source, who was not authorized to speak about details of the case and asked not to be named, a pawnshop owner became suspicious when bustamante attempted to pawn a shotgun and called the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. the source said bustamante would buy back items he had pawned on his pay days and return them. bustamante's attorney, mike torres, said a warrant was issued for bustamante's arrest after he failed to appear at a court hearing last week. he said bustamante was a 17-year veteran of the marshals and a former el paso police officer who lived in el paso with his wife and two children. \"he was a familiar face around the federal courthouse here,\" torres said. \"i'm very shocked by this and very saddened .\" he had a lot of friends and a lot of people that cared about him. \"<mark>carter</mark> said bustamante was on administrative leave from the marshals and had been required to turn in his gun and badge. he said bustamante had not been in mexico on marshals business and that all of the weapons he was charged with stealing had been recovered. <mark>carter</mark> said bustamante was on\" modified status \"with the marshals, meaning he had been required to turn in his gun and badge outside of his official work hours .\" what i can tell you is that the u.s. marshals service is saddened by the death of deputy bustamante and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, \"he said. <mark>carter</mark> said u.s. marshals are working with the fbi and mexican authorities to investigate the death. he said an autopsy will be conducted in mexico, and another may be conducted once bustamante's body is returned to the united states. juarez, which sits across the border from el paso, texas, has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and mexican authorities. the conflict has made violence increasingly common in juarez, tijuana and other mexican border towns. more than 400 deaths in the region have been attributed to the fighting this year .) please avoid offensive, vulgar, or hateful language. dash cam video: nfl player's mother-in-law dies while dealing with police", "articleID": "2009032713_00043869_W", "names":

unnecessary and costs $75 million? no, not a retired elephant in a diamond-studded dress: the answer is, of course, a group of 20 summit. these g-20 meetings--younger, chubbier cousins of the equally pointless g-7 and g-8 summits--have been going on since 1999, in an under-the-radar kind of way, but lately they have taken on a new urgency. indeed, the next one, in london on thursday, is being widely billed as the one that will rescue the international economic system, provoke a stock market rally, create lasting prosperity and save the politicians present from the disgruntled voters protesting outside. and all of this in a single day! yet the truth is that nothing that will be discussed at the summit, and nothing that will be discussed at any of the follow-up summits, could not also have been discussed on the telephone. or by e-mail. or on a skype conference call. indeed, one british writer suggests that \"the world's leaders should have followed their usual platitudes about looking to the future and engaging the young by holding the whole thing on facebook .\" the purpose of this summit, like all such summits, is not really discussion. it is politics. but then, the purpose of this summit, like all such summits, is not really discussion. it is politics. from the hosts' perspective, the primary purpose is to rescue <mark>gordon brown</mark>, the british prime minister, whose popularity is at record lows. <mark>brown</mark> spent the years between 1997 and 2007 serving as britain's chancellor of the exchequer--the equivalent of america's treasury secretary--and thus cannot, like his american counterparts, blame britain's financial crisis on the mistakes of the previous administration. he took credit for britain's booming economy during those years and is being held responsible for britain's unusually deep recession: for weeks now, the british press has been howling for him to \"apologize .\" if nothing else, those official summit photographs--<mark>brown</mark> surrounded by the leaders of america, china, russia, argentina, against the grim, industrial background of london's isle of dogs--will make him feel important again. others have different agendas, none of which entail much real discussion either. the obama administration, for example, hopes to use the summit as a tool to bludgeon the germans and others into spending more money: they want each country present to commit 2 percent of its gross domestic product to a stimulus package, creating a sort of family support structure for the gazillion-dollar american stimulus package. this would, in theory, allow our president, too, to go home and declare victory. and if it doesn't happen, at least he'll have a culprit when the international economy does not fix itself within a month or two: it will all be the fault of the europeans, who--typical continentals!--dither, dissemble and squabble among themselves instead of rallying to the american call. while i am usually the first to accuse the europeans of dithering and dissembling, i actually have some sympathy for the germans on this point. the reason they, the french and many others in europe--the british are an exception--have avoided spending large amounts of money on their economy is not that they are incompetent continentals. it is because they do not think it will work. strange though it may sound, angela merkel, the german chancellor, and nicolas sarkozy, the french president, are leaders who, for better or for worse, came to have some respect for what used to be called anglo-american capitalism, with what used to be its reputation for fiscal conservatism. more to the point, they are also running up against the limits of what they can borrow and are worried about inflation as well. this latter worry is even more acute in many smaller european countries, some of which are actually cutting their budgets and introducing financial austerity packages as a result. though these policies aren't popular now, their advocates might well be proved right in the end. there is an analogy, here, albeit an unfortunate one, to the recent past. after sept. 11, 2001, the bush administration, instead of fixing al-qaeda, afghanistan and pakistan for good, decided to invade iraq. the europeans balked--and those who didn't, such as the british, are now sorry. after the banking crisis, the obama administration, instead of regulating the banking system and the mortgage market, decided to devise a massive stimulus package, build a lot of bridges, expand educational spending and maybe fix health care, too. the europeans are balking again. will those who aren't, such as the british, be sorry a few years from now, too? at least if that happens, this week's g-20 summit will take on genuine importance. it won't be just another summit, producing another pile of documents, containing another bunch of euphemisms but, rather, will be a turning point. it will be remembered forever as the moment some of the rich world headed off in one direction and the rest headed off somewhere else. which might mean it has been worth at least a portion of that $75 million.

2009\" (h.r. 1706). the legislation, sponsored by reps. <mark>bobby rush</mark> (d-il) and henry waxman (d-ca), will help bring lower cost generic drugs to market sooner by preventing abuses in patent settlements between generic and brand prescription drug companies. \"lowering prescription drug prices will be a critical part of comprehensive health reform,\" said aarp board member joanne handy,

makers are able to delay competition by paying off generic manufacturers .\" aarp is proud to endorse \"the protecting consumer access to generic drugs act,' which will put an end to patent settlements that jeopardize the availability of safe, less expensive generic drugs. we look forward to working with reps. <mark>rush</mark> and waxman and their colleagues to pass their legislation as a part of health reform this year .\" aarp's health reform campaign is working to lower prescription drug costs through a variety of changes including ending patent abuse, allowing for the safe and legal importation of lower priced prescription drugs from abroad, closing the medicare part d coverage gap, allowing medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and creating a pathway for the

published on thursday, april 2, 2009 by inter press service electronics firms urged to boycott \"blood minerals' washington - the world's mass consumption of cell phones, laptops and other electronics fuels widespread sexual violence in the democratic republic of congo (drc), according to a new study released wednesday by the non-profit enough project that echoes what many human rights activists and humanitarian workers have been saying for years. the paper,\" can you hear congo now? cell phones, conflict minerals, and the worst sexual violence in the world, \"details how\" conflict minerals \"that are mined in the war-torn drc are sold by rebel groups to purchase arms, and serve as a direct cause of widespread sexual violence in the war-torn country .\" the conflict in eastern drc - the deadliest since world war ii - is fuelled in significant part by a multi-million-dollar trade in minerals, \"the report states .\" armed groups generate an estimated 144 million dollars each year by trading four main minerals: the ores that produce the metals tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. \"working with other non-governmental organisations, the enough project has spent the last year researching the supply chains that link these conflict minerals to many of the world's most demanded electronics, including cell phones, portable music players and computers. drc has suffered from violence brought on by the\" resource curse \"for well over a century. over the past decade, various militias and military units that have dominated conflict-ridden areas of the country have vied for control of mineral-rich areas and their inhabitants in part by using sexual violence. according to the study, 1,100 rape cases are reported each month, the world's highest rate of sexual violence against women and girls .\" women from communities that are being displaced are sometimes so traumatized by the sexual violence that they will never return to their home areas, \"wrote <mark>john prendergast</mark>, co-founder of enough, in a recent editorial in the san francisco chronicle .\" these crimes destroy families, decimate communities, and lethally spread hiv/aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. \"years of unrest have plagued the region. following the 1994 genocide in rwanda, in which some 800,000 ethnic tutsis and moderate hutus were slaughtered by government forces and government-backed militias, hundreds of thousands of hutus associated with the regime fled across the border into the drc, as the tutsi-led rwandan patriotic front (rpf) conquered the country. while many have since returned to rwanda, the continued presence of\" genocidaires \"in eastern congo has been cited by kigali as justification for repeated incursion by its forces over the past 12 years into the region. indeed, the new study was released as oxfam reported wednesday that some 250,000 people in the drc have been displaced following an unprecedented joint operation by rwanda and the drc's own army against the remnants of the hutu forces earlier this year. while the operation was hailed as a success by the two countries, the withdrawal of rwandan forces over the past several weeks has enabled the hutu militias to return to the region where they have carried out a campaign of looting and terror against the local population. oxfam said that congolese soldiers have also engaged in the violence .\" there is widespread looting, burning of villages and an unacceptable peak of sexual violence, \"marcel stoessel, oxfam's country director in dr congo, told the bbc. according to the enough study, the three main armed groups responsible for the violence and who also control much of the mineral trade are the national congress for the defense of the people (cndp), the democratic liberation forces of rwanda (fdlr) and renegade units of the congolese army (fardc). these armed groups profit from the mineral trade by forcibly controlling the mines and exacting bribes, or taxes, from transporters, local and international buyers and border controls. the conflict minerals - tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - are moved from congo to countries in east asia where they are processed into valuable metals needed for the manufacture of a wide range of electronics products. the biggest use of tin worldwide is in electronic products, as a solder on circuit boards. congolese armed groups earn approximately 85 million dollars a year from trade in tin, according to the paper. trade in tantalum, which is used to store electricity in capacitors in ipods, digital cameras, and cell phones earns the armed groups an estimated 8 million dollars annually. tungsten, used to make cell phones vibrate, earns approximately 2 million dollars a year; and gold, used in jewelry and as a component in electronics, provides from 44 million dollars to 88 million dollars a year. enough called for electronics companies to endorse a pledge - similar to that made by the diamond and jewelry industry seven years ago regarding so-called\" blood diamonds \"- that they will manufacture their products without conflict minerals and make their supply chains subject to a transparent audit to back up the pledge. according to the report, companies such as apple, nokia, hewlett packard, and nintendo should\" change their procurement practices and demand that their suppliers provide proof of where their minerals are sourced from. \"enough also urged consumers around the world to use their purchasing power by demanding that companies examine their business practices and become accountable for the sources of minerals used in many of their products\" we're asking consumers to endorse the conflict minerals pledge and contact the 21 leading electronics companies through our raise hope for congo website to build pressure on these companies to make their products conflict-free, \"said <mark>prendergast</mark>. the paper also asks that u.s. president barack obama and congress take concrete steps to ensure the end of violence in the drc by combating its causes .\" president obama must make a clean break with past policy toward congo, which has too often been designed to half-heartedly manage the symptoms of the crisis through humanitarian aid, erratic diplomacy, and peacekeeping assistance, \"according to <mark>prendergast</mark>. he called for obama to name a high-level special envoy with a team that can work in co-ordination with others on the local, national, and regional sources of instability; provide all necessary support to the international criminal court as it attempts to investigate and prosecute war crimes in the drc, and press for making rape as a weapon of war a primary focus of criminal investigations in the eastern part of the country. enough also urged congress to introduce legislation\" that requires companies to disclose where their minerals are sourced, and creates penalties for those who continue purchasing conflict minerals.
