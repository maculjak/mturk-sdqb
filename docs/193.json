but at least one part of stapleton - one governed by its own homeowners' association - recently gave the bird to one of the development's most outspoken chicken lovers, caroline vierow, who runs a facebook page called clucs, or chicken lovers united communityof stapleton. in early february, the stapleton neighborhood #7 hoa, which governs about 100 residences built by kb homes, rejected a request by vierow and her husband, dane, to build a fence and a chicken coop in their back yard. the association said that a coop would\" detract from the harmony of the association \"and went on to explain that\" the board feels that, while chickens are allowed by the city and county of denver under certain criteria...they do indeed attract predators, have a potential for the nuisance of smell, and do not fit into the overall feeling of the community of stapleton #7. in addition, the board feels that allowing a chicken coop could negatively affect the marketability of neighboring homeowners. \"the vierows were surprised .\" stapleton prides itself on being very sustainable and green, \"caroline says .\" there are a lot of people here who have chickens. the master community association doesn't prohibit chickens; they're fine with them. that's why we were so taken aback when the hoa came back with this. \"the association added that the vierows' back yard was also small, and pointed out that forest city, stapleton's master planner, is currently marketing a new housing development - the first part of stapleton that will be north of i-25 - more suited for fowl neighbors.

into it. he probably couldn't have stepped into it worse had he put it in a bag, lit it on fire and stepped on the bag to put out the fire. this is shocking, i'm sure, that cribbs said something and caused a ruckus, but that's what happened. appearing on espn-850 on thursday, cribbs basically said his agents have been talking to other teams about his upcoming free agency. which they're not supposed to do. \"my agent has been meeting with several different teams,\" cribbs said in an on-air interview. \"there is a lot of interest. there are already numbers brought to the table. things are happening. wheels are turning behind closed doors .\" wheels turning? not a lot of wiggle room on that one. this of course would be? you know? against the rules. teams are not supposed to negotiate or even talk to agents of players with other teams until three days prior to free agency. doing so is tampering. this led to a scramble by cribbs' agents to say this was not happening. j.r. rickert posted on twitter. \"[cribbs] is a <mark>cleveland brown</mark> [until] march 12. no other discussions are [in] process .\" which of course makes it so. not to say that nfl teams don't violate the no-contact/tampering rule; it happens all the time. it's one of the reasons the league put in a three-day window prior to the start of free agency. in those three days, agents can talk to teams about a contract, but can't sign them. the new rule makes legal what had been happening for years. that wasn't all cribbs had to say, though. asked if he would accept a role as a special-teamer, cribbs said: \"i've been on this team for many years and watched our offense struggle every single year but once. and every time i step on the field on the offense, the majority of the time there was an exciting play. first down. momentum. for me not to be a part of the offense, i'm not ok with that .\" to say, \"hey, you're just a special teams guy .' i'm not ok with that. especially after catching 42 balls as a no. 3, no. 4 receiver (in 2011). you can't say i can't catch the ball. you can't say if you put me on the field i'm not going to produce. because that's what this game is about .\" ultimately it's producing, putting up points and winning. but now it's becoming more and more about whoever you draft, and opportunity for the draft pick. if these scouts didn't bring in this guy, tough for him. he has to get in where he can get in. we have to play these guys because we drafted these guys. \"it shouldn't be that. if you want to win, you play the guys who are the best. play the best guys who are going to win. too many organizations come to the browns trying to build instead of trying to win this year. put all your eggs into this year .\" because as you see, it's not definite that you'll be here the next year. they said (pat) shurmur was gonna be here for years to come, and that's what (mike) holmgren was preaching, consistency in the organization. but as you see, if you don't win there will be high turnover. put all your eggs in one year. win that year so you can have many more to come. \"at this point it seems like cribbs could not do a better job of opening the door to his exit. joe banner said last week that decisions have been made on the future of the browns free agents - cribbs and kicker phil dawson being the most prominent - but he wouldn't say the decisions. he did, though, stress that the browns will emphasize youth, and bring in younger players. that alone does not sound good for cribbs, who isn't exactly old at 29 but has a lot of miles on a 29-year-old body. cribbs still remains one of the better special teams players in the league. last season he had his best punt return average since 2007 and his best kickoff return average since 2009. he's fearless, but he's also not what he was in '07 when he scored three return touchdowns or in '09 when he scored four. since 2009, he has one return touchdown in three seasons. yes, there are new kickoff rules, but it's still not a good trend for a guy trying to stay with a team that is going younger. add on cribbs' recent chattiness and it just doesn't seem like the browns will want to keep him. cribbs is one of the most cooperative media guys on the browns. he's always willing to talk, it's appreciated and a media guy should never turn away from that. but? sometimes for the guy doing the talking, discretion is the better part of valor. and talking about your deal and a role you will not accept as free agency approaches doesn't seem like the best way to cuddle up with this new regime. banner does not seem like a guy who tolerates this kind of thing - especially when cribbs basically admits that he and his agents are guilty of tampering. though of course his agents said that's not so. at this point, it's been a great ride with cribbs, but his future seems like it will be elsewhere. subscribe today and get a full year of copyright? scout.com. all rights reserved. this

group to'erau manu rahi, which oliveros as well as her three children are members of. this family-friendly atmosphere of to'erau is a leading component as to why the group has grown from twelve members to more than 150 in less than three years. \"they like to include everybody in everything, even if it's not dance related,\" says <mark>kim turner</mark>, mother of sixteen-year-old vanessa caluya. \"everyone in the group is always there for one another, lending a helping hand whenever needed .\" now with great experience and more exposure, the to'erau family will be attending its first out-of-state competition - the heiva i honolulu - hosted by tahiti nui international, from march 21 to 23 at the waikiki shell. \"the creation of to'erau was by a random decision that me and my brother, erik, made,\" says to'erau director and co-founder crystal boquiren. \"one day we sat down and decided to just go for it. the next day we went out and got a business license, and within two weeks, we were set .\" te aranui photo credit: to'erau manu rahi though the group developed in such a short amount of time, the combined history and experience of the boquirens catalyzed the strength and foundation of the group. though he started out at age nine as a dancer for tahitian dance company te mana o te ra in walnut creek, california, erik soon became absorbed in drumming. \"i eventually became the music director for hui tama nui (in vallejo, california) where we won multiple first place music, first place drumming, and\" best overall group' awards at the san jose tahiti fete and heiva i reno competitions, \"says erik, who is now in charge of concept design for productions, composing and arranging original drum beats and songs, and male choreography for to'erau. known for his not-so-typical tahitian drum teaching style, erik's students have established a nickname for their leader .\" they like to call me the \"bad cop' for my aggressive teaching and instruction with influences from being in and teaching marching percussion,\" says erik, who was a member-turned-instructor for award-winning drumlines at springstowne middle school and jesse bethel high school, both in vallejo, california. with mostly word-of-mouth advertising and support from the boquirens' mentors - sam almira and lisa aguilar - to'erau has made it a point to continue traditions and appropriately represent the tahitian culture. \"sam almira has been very supportive. he recognized the talent and pushed us,\" says crystal about the well-known tahitian drummer who has been deemed \"the godfather\" and is founder of award-winning group hui tama nui. \"he makes sure we have appropriate material and represent the culture respectfully .\" crystal's experience began as early as the age of ten when she became a member of te mana o te ra. much of her growth as a member of the tahitian dance community has come from the group's leader, lisa aguilar. \"she's made a huge impact on me and erik, and we owe a lot of our success to her,\" says crystal. after being a dancer for many years, crystal eventually became a music director for hui tama nui, where she worked with long-time tahitian dance frontrunner, the sencil family. \"aaron [sencil] completely changed the game, like how bruce lee did kung fu,\" says jeff sencil, former drummer of the kalihi dancers, about hui tama nui's direction shift from traditional to modern, yet still keeping the cultural spirit alive. it was much later during this change that hui tama nui took a break and to'erau found its own birth in january 2010. crystal's motivation to teach and to share the family bond of to'erau is the reason why, despite the many intense hours of rehearsal and preparation, she continues to build her group. \"i love when students have an immense passion to do well. they are always hungry to learn more and want to do better,\" says crystal. \"those students really inspire me and motivate me to become the teacher that i am, and make me love what i do .\" for <mark>turner</mark>'s daughter, vanessa, to'erau was a much needed group for those dance members who had taken a break. \"she [vanessa] had always wanted to go back to dancing. we knew that crystal and her brother had formed their own halau (dance group), because they used to sing/dance/drum in our former group,\" says <mark>turner</mark>. \"we also knew they had the experience needed to run and maintain a successful halau. plus, several other girls vanessa had danced with from our old group joined tmr .\" since 2010, the group has competed and/or performed at the kiki raina tahiti fete, manahere, san jose tahiti fete, na maka, heiva i reno, and te aranui. prior to competition, months and months of preparation are involved. from the music composition to the last-minute changes on the day of a show, the boquirens not only manage the members, they open their home and hearts to members who need them the most. \"there are always people in our house,\" says crystal. we're always spending time with each other, whether it be bowling or grocery shopping. \"but when it's time to work, production begins on a blank canvas with crystal and erik deciding on a theme. once a theme is in place, there is a blueprint of which piece will go in which spot .\" in tahitian culture, it's all about making sure that we follow the legend appropriately, \"says crystal, who looks to sam almira for guidance in designing a show. following the theme, songwriting takes place - a task that can sometimes take only an hour to do, but about two weeks to teach .\" me and my brother just sit and go for it, \"says crystal, who focuses on the vocal aspect and arrangement of a piece .\" whatever comes out becomes a song. \"\"when writing songs, it normally starts with my sister providing lyrics that are translated in english so we could see if it's a\" happy' or \"sad' song, or a song about love or nature. then, see what kind of chord progression to make, either a minor or major chord progression. from there, we start humming melodies, and the rest is history,\" says erik. \"the type of music we play has a very jazzy and r & b feel, but we still stay true to traditional tahitian music, to give it kind of a fusion .\" under the direction of crystal and erik, there are other instructors who help bring out and preserve the tahitian culture for this 150 + member group. malia villanueva instructs the children, jiusten santos instructs the men, danilo calingo assists as drum instructor, and jerwyn sendaydiego and joseph sai design the costumes. \"it's fun and wonderful to watch, especially knowing all the time, energy, and hard work that go into making the group successful,\" says <mark>turner</mark> about the show design from beginning to end. in addition, there are many parents of family members, such as <mark>turner</mark>, who have helped and continue to do so simply out of the love and dedication that has become recognized by other groups. \"we really, really have a unique, close-knit bond. we even get noticed for how positive and supportive we are of each other by the tahitian community,\" says crystal. \"like all families, we argue, but we argue in person instead of talking behind each other's back. it makes us stronger to become even more positive. it's unconditional .\" and it is this distinct bond that has drawn the attention of many parents to have their children become part of such a dynamic group. \"to'erau manu rahi is definitely one of a kind. they are such a warm and friendly group of people that care so much about each other,\" says eileen madayag, mother of six-year-old dancer reese madayag. \"we were looking for a group that was very family-oriented and kid-friendly, but most of all, patient and welcoming with beginners. crystal and erik are great leaders that offer the best support and guidance. we could not ask for a better family to be part of .\" positive leadership skills have brought the boquirens much familial success. their welcoming demeanor has not only been a deciding factor for children to join, but the children's parents, as well. \"it's always a good feeling to see all of the families make memories that last lifetimes,\" says erik. \"we have so many mothers dancing with their children, it's an amazing feeling,\" says oliveros, who used to dance when she was younger, and has now returned to share in the experience. \"when i introduced my children to the culture, they took it and showed appreciation, love, and respect for it. this is what they love to dance and it's great that we can all share it together .\" oliveros' children are eleven-year-old josiah rillera, six-year-old mariah oliveros-nau, and three-year-old caliyah oliveros-nau. of the three, two of them will be part of the heiva i honolulu competition. mariah will be competing in the solo category, while caliyah will be performing in exhibition. \"mariah, who is only six years old, has definitely made her mark in the tahitian community. she won first place last year,\" says crystal. first place is no stranger to to'erau. thirteen-year-old dancer darien panday has won in every single competition he has entered. \"he always wins first or second place,\" says crystal. \"last year he won the overall category (meaning he was the best in the entire competition), in which he competed against over 400 people .\" though there can only be one first place winner in every category, the parents of to'erau members see their children winning every day. \"to'erau has taught her to be more disciplined and to try harder to accomplish her goals,\" says <mark>turner</mark> about daughter vanessa. \"it also has and is, still teaching her to be more confident and to push herself more .\" for oliveros, her children have learned the true meaning of respect and love. \"my children have become some of the strongest children i know by being part of such a great family as to'erau manu rahi,\" says oliveros. \"my family has gained such a new meaning to life by being surrounded by such a great group of people that allows everyone to be a part of. everyone is treated equally no matter your age, shape, or size. if you dance with your heart, that is all that is ever expected. our ra'atiras (teachers) crystal and erik, provide us with a chance at a lot of things that seem, to many, impossible or unreachable .\" success in every form has been awarded to this tight-knit group of dancers, musicians, and parents. the weekly rehearsals, show design, costume making, fundraising, and so much more, have brought them to a point in their development where the possibilities are limitless. \"last year, it was not in my thoughts that we would be able to travel to hawaii to participate in heiva i honolulu, but here we are!\" says crystal. with a history embedded in the tahitian culture, and a fresh take on songwriting, the to'erau family hopes to one day bring its talent to tahiti, but this year, honolulu welcomes to'erau with much appreciation and respect. their name alone, has spoken volumes to those who have followed. to'erau manu rahi translates to \"great birds of the north winds\" , a fitting label for a group that continues to move forward and exemplify positive action. \"we chose a name that signified strength .\" to'erau' comes from a sense of new life and strength in the new generation, \"says crystal .\" \"manu' means bird, and birds are closest to the heavens. they're known for having the eyes of god .\" and strength in a family bond is what has kept this group motivated to lead every member down a righteous path. \"it is a huge stepping stone for what's to come,\" says erik about the heiva i competition. though nothing may be set for the future as far as competitions and productions, \"one thing that i can guarantee is that we will still be\" utuafare', \"says crystal.", "articleID":

"content": "in heavily eroded areas like delacroix, old maps and charts are invaluable for finding new fishing spots, particularly this time of year. capt. <mark>jack payne</mark> has been studying satellite maps that predate the 2005 passage of hurricane katrina to learn where the old ponds and small lakes were. for the past several weeks, he's been fishing those water bodies, and has been catching plenty of keeper speckled trout. \"some of the spots we were fishing today were old duck ponds prior to katrina,\" <mark>payne</mark> said after a wednesday-morning trip. \"now, that old pond is surrounded by open water that's 20 times the size of the pond before katrina. so you kind of look at your old charts, and you see the pond before katrina, and of course, that's going to be your deepest water .\" the washouts surrounding those old ponds may be a foot or two deep, but the ponds themselves are in 4 - to 5-foot wheelhouse that <mark>payne</mark> said is the magic zone for this time of year. \"everybody thinks those trout run out of the area when a front comes through, but they really don't; they just run to the deeper part,\" <mark>payne</mark> said. \"if there's a 6-foot section in that (washout), the trout will pile in there. when the water warms back up, they'll disperse out in the (washout).\" <mark>payne</mark> fishes out of a 23-foot kenner, and he's fearless about exploring. he's constantly looking for new hotspots, and is frequently rewarded. after putting nearly two dozen trout in the boat during wednesday's short trip, he made a quick drift in a washout he had never fished before, and caught several more fish. he filed it away in his memory bank for further exploration this weekend. newcomers to the area who attempt to mimic the technique should look for old passages to the ponds, and definitely bring along a push pole. they might also want to make sure their sea tow memberships are up to date.", "articleID": "2013031416_00012506_W",
