I used to respond to such emails telling him to get back to bed - albeit many hours later, so they weren't that effective. I am now less shocked at the time stamp on his correspondence as I know he's an insomniac and, despite adapting his lifestyle and at times willing himself to sleep, he invariably finds himself awake at horrible hours. The only upside? He gets a crazy amount of work completed while the rest of us are sleeping. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. We all know colleagues who work long hours - the guys and girls who are always at their computers so you never know if they've actually gone home. Are long hours a prerequisite for success? My insomniac friend is hugely productive and a standout performer but I'm not sure I can say that of all those in our industry who habitually work late into the night. Some work late because it's an industry norm and nobody wants to be the first to leave the office. The work-life balance debate recently featured in a Twitter exchange between technology investor Blake Robbins, who has worked for companies like Google and SpaceX, and venture capitalist Keith Rabois, a long-time investor and employee at successful start-ups PayPal and LinkedIn. Robbins tweeted: \"When I first got into tech, I thought it was\" cool' to work on the weekends or holidays. I quickly realised that's a recipe for disaster. Not hanging with friends and family because you're working isn't cool. Burning out isn't cool. \"I promise you...your competition isn't beating you because they are working more hours than you. It's because they're working smarter .\" Rabois quickly responded: \"Totally false. Read a bio of Elon Musk. Or about Amazon. Or about the first four years of Facebook or PayPal. It is pure arrogance to believe you can outsmart other talented people .\" Rabois is at the extreme end of the \"hard work camp'. In a Stanford University class on start-up companies, he posted a slide quoting NFL coach <mark>Bill Walsh</mark>:\" How to tell if you're doing the job: If you're up at 3am every night, have a knot in your stomach, a rash on your skin and you're losing touch with your wife and kids. \"Rabois concluded:\" If this doesn't sound appetising, you probably shouldn't start a company. \"At the other end of the debate are psychologists who point to the\" labour illusion'; it says people routinely confuse effort with results - to the point where effort is over-appreciated relative to the actual outcome. Psychology writer Oliver Burkeman says, contrary to the thinking that a jammed schedule equates to high productivity, it has been very well demonstrated that in certain fields - particularly those requiring creativity - less \"work\" can actually lead to more value. There is, I think, a middle ground. Work hard - harder than your competitors - but don't go crazy. Mathematician Richard Hamming once lectured on how people can do great work, \"Nobel-Prize type of work\". \"Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10 per cent more than the other, the latter will more than twice out-produce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity .\" The logic applies to most aspects of our life."}, {"articleID": "2018012421_00577410_W", "names": {"Jim Hackett": ["Q13129314", "Q30030987"], "Mark Field": ["Q304450", "Q6767598"]}, "date": "2018-01-24", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-24/ford-stresses-fitness-after-failing-to-seize-on-strong-revenue", "content": "Ford Stresses \"Fitness' After Failing to Seize on Strong Revenue - Bloomberg Bloomberg the Company & Its Products Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Bloomberg Anywhere Login Bloomberg Terminal Demo Request Bloomberg Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.

Automotive revenue surged to $38.5 billion in the last three months of last year, about $1.8 billion better than analysts projected. But strong sales only managed to boost earnings to a level that disappointed investors when Ford reported preliminary results last week. The automaker has telegraphed trouble for this year, issuing a warning that profit will slip and prompting a sharp selloff that's cost Ford about $4.2 billion in market value. Chief Executive Officer <mark>Jim Hackett</mark> has earmarked $14 billion in cost cuts over five years and has said the company will drop some car models from its lineup to focus on more lucrative sport utility vehicles and pickups. \"We are intensely focused on improving the operational fitness of our business to deliver strong results while continuing to build toward our vision of the future,\" <mark>Hackett</mark> said Wednesday in a statement. This year, Ford has said it will face a $1.6 billion headwind from rising prices of steel, aluminum and other raw materials, as well as adverse exchange rates. On the strength of rising F-Series truck sales, Ford boosted quarterly revenue and market share in North America, yet pretax profit fell to $1.6 billion. Rising raw material and warranty costs dragged on earnings in the region--the company warned in October that an F-Series recall would cost about Overseas, Ford lost money in South America, while profit declined in Europe. The company barely broke even in Asia as both sales and prices fell in China. Wall Street Wary Wall Street has been wary of Ford. Its profit forecast for this year reneges on former CEO <mark>Mark Field</mark>'s promise that earnings would rebound after 2017. Instead, the automaker said the rising cost of raw materials and the expense of developing autonomous and electric cars will weigh on 2018 profits. \"It was a very challenging year,\" Bob Shanks, chief financial officer, told reporters Wednesday at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. \"It's very, very clear that we have to improve the fitness of the company .\" <mark>Hackett</mark>, who is preparing the company for an ambitious plan to roll out robot taxis and driverless delivery vehicles by 2021, warned last week that this will be a \"bad year .\" Ford shares have fallen about 8 percent since the company issued its profit warning on Jan. 16. Last year, the stock rose just 3 percent, while General Motors Co. jumped 18 percent and Tesla Inc. soared 46 percent. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S.-listed shares outperformed them all, nearly doubling during 2017. \"There's a lot of frustration,\" David Whiston, a Chicago-based auto analyst with Morningstar, said before Ford released earnings. \"People feel like it's not going to get better any time soon .\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal."}, {"articleID": "2016082314_00204977_W", "names": {"Abhishek Gupta": ["Q27951640", "Q42287900", "Q53294409"]}, "date": "2016-08-23", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.in/Idea-rebuff-mergertalks-with-Vodafone/articleshow/53829543.cms#commentHash", "content": "Idea rebuff merger talks with Vodafone Reuters Aug 23, 2016, 07.25 PM Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google + Reddit Continue reading India's No. 3 mobile phone carrier, Idea Cellular, strongly denied a news report on Tuesday that it was in exploratory talks about a merger with larger rival Vodafone India. A spokeswoman for Idea's parent, conglomerate Aditya Birla, called the CNBC TV18 report of talks between Idea and Vodafone \"baseless and absolutely false\". \"This is absolutely untrue and preposterous,\" she said in an email. \"There is no such intent .\" Shares in Idea closed 6.9 percent higher on Tuesday after the TV channel said the two sides were in talks, citing unnamed sources. A spokesman for Vodafone India, India's No. 2 operator by market share and the local arm of Britain's Vodafone Group Plc, declined to comment on the report. India is the world's second-biggest mobile phone market by subscriptions, behind China, but high competition in the crowded market has kept profits under pressure. Adding to the competition, Reliance Jio - a telecom venture backed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani - is set to launch commercial operations in the coming months. \"Both of them are struggling with their data revenue market share and ahead of a big competitive change in the industry they might want to get bigger,\" IDFC securities analyst <mark>Abhishek Gupta</mark> said of Idea and Vodafone India. Any such deal would also face tough regulatory scrutiny and analysts say approvals would be unlikely, as the companies would breach the 50 percent revenue market share limit in many regions of the country if they did try to merge. \"It's very unlikely,\" PhillipCapital (India) analyst Naveen Kulkarni said, citing the regulatory hurdles. \"I'm doubtful whether this can go through but there could be some other form of merger, such as spectrum-sharing deals,\" he added.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Jan. 21, says that a gun show ban passed by the board members of Del Mar Fair in 2018 is unconstitutional and has violated the plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights and others. \"The 41-page complaint alleges that the Del Mar action has purposely violated the First Amendment free speech rights of the plaintiffs and constitutes a prior restraint on speech, along with the equal protection of the plaintiffs,\" said a written statement from the CRPA. Crossroads of the West, one of the plaintiffs, has held gun shows about five times a year at the fairground over the past 30 years, according to Fox 5. In September 2018, the 22nd District Agricultural Association, a nine-member board operating the Del Mar Fairgrounds on behalf of the state, decided to stop renewing the contract with the Crossroads of the West Gun Show for 2019.

Board President Steve Shewmaker said at a meeting that he's concerned about safety issues after several arrests were made in the fairground as felony offenders sent \"their wives and girlfriends in to buy ammunition and guns\" at the gun show.

However, the board's decision didn't convince everyone. \"It sounds like a nice,\" here is our olive branch,' but it's really nothing. It means we're going to do whatever we can to make sure you can't do your business model the way you normally operate, \"Tracy Olcott, president of Crossroads of the West, told Fox 5. Olcott also said the Crossroads shows typically brought the fairgrounds between $500,000 and $700,000 a year.

Dick Durbin (D-Ill .), the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, told the Hill that he is \"reflecting\" on whether to end the filibuster on bills if the 2020 elections give his party control of the Senate. (Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA) By Jon Healey Deputy Editorial Page Editor July 18, 2019 12:02 PM Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link URL Copied! Print \"Severe memory lapse\" must be one of the (many) debilitating side effects that can result from being elected to Congress. I can't think of any other way to explain why Senate Democratic leaders told the Hill that they won't rule out killing the last vestiges of the filibuster if they retake control of the chamber in 2020. Less than six years ago, Democrats led by former Senate Majority Leader <mark>Harry Reid</mark> (D-Nev .) ended the filibuster on presidential nominees for the executive branch and most federal courts. It was an act born of frustration--the Republican minority had resolutely blocked votes on all three of President Obama's nominees to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But in doing so, <mark>Reid</mark> laid the path for Republicans to eliminate the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees after they retook the Senate and President Trump nominated his first justice. That's why Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh are on the high court, despite attracting the support of bare majorities of the Senate. And why Trump has been able to flood the courts with his nominees, a number of whom have been rated unqualified by the American Bar Assn. Notably, <mark>Reid</mark> made no move to kill the filibuster on legislation, which means that bills routinely require 60 votes to come up for debate on the floor, then 60 votes to go to a vote. His successor as majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has similarly resisted the push from partisans to end the legislative filibuster, despite pressure from Trump just to steamroll Democrats and enact his agenda. Advertisement Now, top Senate Democrats are signaling a willingness to bar filibusters on bills too, should they reclaim the majority. According to the Hill, both Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill .) said the idea was on the table, which marks a considerable shift for Durbin. When asked why, Durbin told the newspaper that the status quo in the Senate was no longer acceptable: \"This is a different Senate. It is unproductive under the current state of affairs .\" The best arguments for killing the filibuster are that it's undemocratic and that it has been transformed from a rarely used tool to force compromises into a quotidien implement of obstruction. Both of those points are valid, yet the Senate is undemocratic and inefficient by design. Less populous states hold disproportionate power, given that the four senators from Idaho and Wyoming have as many votes as the four from California and New York. The Founders' intent was for the House to channel the passions of the electorate and for the Senate to cool them through a more deliberate process. The salutory effect of the filibuster is that it promotes legislation that has at least some bipartisan buy-in. Without that, you end up with embattled initiatives like the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans feel free to undermine because none of them voted for it. Durbin is right, though, that the gridlocked status quo in Washington cries out for change. For more than a decade, Congress has been unable to get anything done on the biggest issues of the day. The only exceptions have come when power was concentrated in one party's hands and the issue could be addressed through a budget bill not subject to the filibuster. The result: inaction on problems like our failed immigration policies, and purely partisan and often unsustainable actions on issues like healthcare and tax rates. Advertisement The fundamental problem here is that members have little interest in compromising or not enough incentive to do so. This is one of the bitter fruits of partisan gerrymandering that the Supreme Court ignored. When the only real threat to your reelection is drawing a primary challenge from someone more deeply partisan than you are, you don't have much reason to work with the other side on solutions that neither side loves but both sides can live with. Killing the filibuster won't fix that. Instead, it will simply make federal law and policy more volatile, with statutes and regulations being whipsawed by each change in control of Congress. Granted, it makes little sense to allow two filibusters on every piece of legislation, as is the case today; ideally, senators would eliminate the filibuster on the motion to begin debate on a bill while preserving the option to filibuster the motion to end it. But then, any more to restrict legislative filibusters would probably hasten the end to all of them. Lawmakers seem to be moving in only one direction on the filibuster, and it's not the right one."}, {"articleID": "2009061315_00055188_W", "names": {"Al Green": ["Q14469655", "Q313260", "Q4703915", "Q749039"], "David Byrne": ["Q1173887", "Q16151648", "Q21466735", "Q22000528", "Q28232492", "Q336640", "Q43128176", "Q5231984", "Q5231985", "Q5231986", "Q53098115"]}, "date": "2009-06-13", "url": "http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/bonnaroo-heats-up-with-phish-beastie-boys-1003984215.story", "content": "troy carpenter and jeff vrabel, manchester, tenn. day 2 at bonnaroo: the rain held off but the heat didn't, animal collective and phoenix made fans believe the hype, public enemy had them arguing otherwise, the beastie boys brought out a fellow new york mc to debut a new track and an energized phish ended their night with \"a day in the life .\" phish held down their responsibilities as ringleader of the main stage on friday night. the two-day headliners (including sunday's festival-closing set) came through with a set full of crowd-pleasers, a little something for everyone but nothing outrageously mind-blowing all told. five years on from \"farewell festival\" coventry, phish seemed back at home in front of the immense crowd, playing a good deal of the classic phish canon including \"harry hood,\" \"wilson,\" \"you enjoy myself,\" \"divided sky\" and \"chalkdust torture\" roller-coaster improvisational work highlighted \"kill devil falls,\" while the band's playful nature was best represented by a trio of covers: ac/dc's \"highway to hell,\" \"also sprach zarathusra\" (\"2001\" ), and an encore performance of the beatles' \"a day in the life .\" phish put on what for most bands would be a powerhouse headlining performance, but it was clear restraint was a factor as well;
