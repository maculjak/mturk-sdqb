associated press new york - six months after barack obama's inauguration, a persistent and noisy legion of doubters won't let go of an already debunked claim - that he is actually a foreign-born, illegal president. the issue has flared again on political blogs, tv news shows and even a town hall meeting, widely circulated on youtube, in which a republican congressman was booed for saying obama is a citizen. mainstream republicans who want the issue to go away are having a tough time stamping it out as the so-called \"birthers\" resurface, with assists from talk show host rush limbaugh and cnn's lou dobbs. some who had initially dismissed the claim as a laughable political sideshow now wonder whether it's gotten out of control. \"i've stopped laughing,\" new york daily news columnist errol louis wrote thursday. \"too many political and media leaders are deliberately fanning the flames of ignorance and fear, and they should be ashamed .\" passions among the birthers run so high that rep. mike castle, of delaware, was booed by his own constituents at a recent town hall meeting for saying obama \"is a citizen of the united states .\" he was responding to a woman who waved her own birth certificate, contended obama was born in kenya, and shouted out, \"i want my country back!\" theories that obama was born abroad abounded during the presidential campaign, even after an official hawaii birth certificate was produced, along with august 1961 birth notices from two honolulu newspapers. numerous lawsuits and emergency appeals were lodged challenging obama's eligibility to be president, and all were rebuffed. the constitution states that a person must be a \"natural-born citizen\" to be eligible for the presidency. the birthers contend that obama's hawaiian birth certificate is a fake, and many say he was actually born in kenya, his father's homeland. limbaugh, for example, joked that obama and god have something in common - the lack of a birth certificate. dobbs has broached the issue several times, saying at one point, \"the questions won't go away .\" and 10 republican members of congress have co-sponsored a bill that would require future presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate. one of those congressmen, <mark>john campbell</mark> of california, was pressed by msnbc's <mark>chris matthews</mark> as to whether he believed obama was a u.s. citizen. \"as far as i know,\" <mark>campbell</mark> replied. the issue also was raised by cnn's <mark>larry king</mark> this week, in a conversation with liz cheney, a former state department official and daughter of former vice president dick cheney. \"i think the democrats have got more crazies than the republicans do,\" liz cheney said. \"but setting that aside, one of the reasons you see people so concerned about this...people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, i think, a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas .\" a fellow guest, democratic strategist james carville, suggested cheney should have been more critical of those questioning obama's citizenship. \"she refuses to say this is ludicrous because she wants these people to believe this,\" he said. carville is among many democratic commentators suggesting that republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base. even some conservatives say dragging out the controversy only hurts the republican cause and helps obama. \"he has a significant number of conservatives wasting enormous amounts of time on a side issue that can never bear any fruit and, as an added bonus, it makes them look somewhat unhinged to many americans,\" wrote conservative blogger <mark>john hawkins</mark> on townhall.com. \"when your political enemies are making fools of themselves, why stop them?\" john feehery, a gop consultant and former press secretary for dennis hastert when he was house speaker, suggested that dobbs and other broadcast figures were seeking to capitalize on the controversy to boost ratings. \"it says more about the media culture we're entering and the decline of responsible journalism, and less about the political realm,\" feehery said. as for the birth certificate bill introduced by the 10 house republicans, feehery said, \"it's so they can point to something if they're asked questions .\" the president's birthplace and citizenship have been among the most popular topics in e-mails to ask ap, a q & a column where associated press journalists respond to readers' questions about the news. over the past year, dozens of readers have asked about obama's birth certificate, or have simply declared that he was born in kenya and asked why he's allowed to serve as president. seemingly unimpeachable evidence hasn't swayed the birthers, as msnbc's conservative talk show host <mark>joe scarborough</mark> noted this week. \"they would rather be like sea lions barking at waves,\" he said. \"instead of trying to figure out what's happening to their country...they embrace conspiracy theories, and they make themselves look like cartoon characters .\" comments

on cpsia tracking labels this article originally appeared in pw's children's bookshelf. sign up now! by karen raugust--publishers weekly, 7/23/2009 3:00:00 pm the consumer product safety commission issued its long-awaited statement of policy on the tracking labels required for all manufacturers of children's products, under the consumer product safety improvement act. new chairman inez tenenbaum, as well as commissioners <mark>thomas moore</mark> and nancy nord, voted on monday to approve the guidelines. the tracking label provision, section 103 (a) of the cpsia, goes into effect on august 14 and affects only products manufactured on or after that date. the guidelines allow publishers to be flexible in how they comply with the provision, which is what the industry, through the association of american publishers, had been pushing for. in a statement about the new policy, tenenbaum said: \"the commission...has agreed that section 103 (a) does not require a uniform\" one size fits all' labeling system. rather, the only \"uniform' requirement is that the tracking information required by statute be ascertainable from the distinguishing marks made on the children's product and its packaging. how an individual manufacturer chooses to achieve this end is left to the reasonable judgment of each individual manufacturer .\" in other words, publishers can print the \"tracking label,\" which must be permanent and appear on the product and packaging, anywhere on the book and in any form, as long as it contains the specific source of the product, including the country, city and state where the product was manufacturered, the date of production, and cohort information such as the batch or run number. the information can be printed in full on the product, or a code can be used to allow consumers to find the information online. click here to read a list of faqs about compliance with section 103 (a). test older books. all publishers of books printed from august 14 forward must include tracking labels on their products, whether or not they must test for lead. alison morris, children's book buyer, wellesley booksmith, wellesley, mass. josie leavitt, co-owner,

\"treasury will periodically auction excess operating funds to participants for a fixed term at a rate determined through a competitive bidding process .\" another view of tios from the st. louis fed is here. now for some interesting quotes, with our comments and simplications [sic?], from a few federal reserve members over the last 17 years: \"the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle. the foreign exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger. daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $130 billion. the daily volume for treasury securities is about $110 billion. the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange, the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $7 billion and $10 billion .\" --former federal reserve governor, <mark>robert heller</mark> in the wall street journal on october 27, 1989 1. governor <mark>heller</mark> actually admits that the fed can \"handle\" the stock market, way back in 1989. 2. the fed already participates in the $110 billion daily treasury securities market. all activity of all the stock markets is less than 10% of the size of the treasury market. \"an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market: the federal reserve...the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign exchange markets. the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities. the stock market is the only major market without a marketmaker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort .\" ...\"the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thus stabilizing the market as a whole .\" --former federal reserve governor, <mark>robert heller</mark> in the wall street journal on october 27, 1989 1. another admission by governor <mark>heller</mark> that the fed, way back in 1989, assumed responsibility for preventing \"disorderly conditions\" in the market for treasury bonds and bills. 2. he also observes the lack of a \"buyer of last resort\" , even though the executive order establishing the \"working group on financial markets\" (also sometimes called the plunge protection team, or ppt) was issued earlier in 1988. the avowed purpose of the ppt is to prevent or control a large stock market crash like what occurred in october 1987. \"executive order 12631 - working group on financial markets - mar. 18, 1988; 53 fr 9421, 3 cfr, 1988 comp., p. 559: by virtue of the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and laws of the united states of america, and in order to establish a working group on financial markets, it is hereby ordered as follows: the secretary of the treasury, or his designee; the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system, or his designee; the chairman of the securities and exchange commission, or his designee; and the chairman of the commodity futures trading commission, or her designee .\" 3. a method of \"supporting\" the stock market via buying futures was named. \"the last duty of a central banker is to tell the public the truth .\" --alan blinder, vice chairman of the federal reserve, on pbs's nightly business report in 1994 1. oh...2. our favorite quote from a member of the federal

is this \"fed-speak\" for the ppt since the fed is actually a private organization, or perhaps for the crmpg? even without the benefit of a tinfoil hat, the concept of private and controlling surveillance of the market is quite disturbing. 2. an admission that governments interfere (\"supplement\" ) during periods of \"sub-optimal\" performance, from the maestro. we wonder who defines what is sub-optimal, at the very least, and also note that september 2002 was also the approximate bottom in the u.s. stock markets. 3. the first public tio transaction from the u.s. treasury was in april 2002 ....so what does it mean when the fed hands over billions in sloshy loot to play with?

(my ipod deserves mention during this trip; it heroically played for almost nine straight hours on the way down and about eight hours on the way back .) the wipers on the crazy high setting, the one where you think surely the wipers will just fly right off the car, were of almost no help in visibility. it was a crazy rainstorm, but i can thank my stars that it came at a point where the road was fairly straight and fairly flat - instead of at the tennessee-north carolina border, which was a petrifying climb straight up and over and then down again. i coasted down on neutral on the way back and hopefully saved myself a little gas. jennifer's husband has traveled a great deal for his job in the past, so she had platinum status at our hotel, which meant free wine and haagen-dazs and breakfast. also the beds were quite comfy and they gave us little chocolates in the shape of north carolina, with a small white dot where asheville is. very cute. now, the workshop itself was with a gentleman from toronto named <mark>michael stone</mark>, who has written a brilliant if not easily digestible book called the inner tradition of yoga, which is arranged very loosely around various topics of yoga philosophy. he is a wonderful writer, and a great soul, and his photo on the back made him look like, as jennifer said it, a \"yoga hottie\". the picture turned out to be quite kind to him - he seemed not to have shaved or had a haircut since the picture was taken - and his personality was thoroughly different than the writing made it seem, but for all that it was amazing to study with him. he was so funny, and so thoughtful, and so committed to his lifestyle that it was inspiring. he made all kinds of wonderful yoga jokes, like telling us that utkatasana translates as \"favorite pose\" or \"easiest pose\" in sanskrit (i can't imagine that it's anyone's favorite pose, it's not at all pleasant or easy to do, and it translates literally as \"powerful pose\" , but also as \"chair\" or \"awkward chair\" or \"fierce\" ), and getting us into upward-facing dog and then chatting for a few minutes about the weather and whatnot while we waited, giggling in agony, for him to tell us to release, and so on. when walking around while we were in uttanasana, he talked in a low voice about all the \"stories\" that we tell ourselves (this is a major precept in his book), all the little insecurities that our brains like to chatter about as we're trying to concentrate on our yoga. \"i don't know what i'm doing in north carolina. her pants are so cute. why am i still talking to these people? they stopped listening a long time ago. i know i don't have anything good to say. i wonder what's happening back home .\" except the things he actually said were vastly funnier than these examples. i loved this. it made me feel 800 times better about my own inner monologue, which i feel it is hopeless for me to try to get rid of. his style of teaching was also so sure, and although his rhythm and pronunciation when he spoke reminded me of nothing so much as <mark>steve martin</mark> - that same exactness of consonants, the same elastic masculine tone - he did have a lovely voice. the main pieces of the workshop were sitting meditation, lecture/questions, asana, and pranayama. we did some of each in every session. we also did two brief workshop exercises, which i'll talk about in my next post. i learned something about myself and my current practice and my future practice in each piece. in sitting meditation, i learned that i am not afraid of meditation being a somewhat futile exercise for me for the rest of my life, but am also not afraid to let it grow very, very slowly. in lecture, oh, innumerable things. \"our fantasies of enlightenment obscure enlightenment .\" \"objectivity is a fairy tale .\" \"...recognizing that my viewpoint is just a viewpoint .\" \"enter there .\" in asana, i think i truly understood beginner's mind, the approach to asana as if it is new each time, and not feeling constrained by what i have been taught. such freedom there. in pranayama, i learned a lot about my limits, and about not being afraid to disobey the teacher if it's not right for me. i explored breathing and my feelings about it, and learned that there is something severely unresolved in me as regards breath. more on that also in my next post. there was so much more to this experience: jennifer's parents, asheville in its supreme vibrancy, an interesting guy whose energy i failed to fully understand, the exhaustion of ashtanga-style asana practice, the difficulty of mysore-style asana, and many, many tears. but i'm at 1100 words and i need to save the rest for another time. possibly related posts: (automatically generated)", "articleID": "2009080412_00048477_W", "names": {"Michael Stone": ["Q15987708", "Q21067357", "Q344648", "Q43198636", "Q6834644", "Q6834645", "Q6834647", "Q6834648", "Q786093"], "Steve Martin": ["Q16473", "Q2347163", "Q48152466", "Q55085130", "Q55085225", "Q7613276", "Q7613279", "Q7613281", "Q7613283"]}}]
