Normally the Elks play their home games on their own patch at the University of Ulster Jordanstown but it proved to be a low risk strategy as they won the game 4-1. Although it was an all Ulster affair <mark>Ricky Lee</mark> and his team did their utmost to make the occasion a bit special and they deserve immense credit for doing so but more on that later. I hadn't been to Mossley's headquarters for more than a decade and, although I didn't mention it at the time, I was somewhat puzzled when our intrepid photographer Rowland White said to me\" you can't miss it, it's right beside the railway station \".\" What railway station? \"I asked myself. There was no such station on my last visit as it was so long ago, but some things never change and after getting there in good time I was greeted by some familiar faces at the entrance to the club house. Club stalwarts Harry Burns, Bertie Moore and Dougie Sleith were all there and three proud men they were as they chatted about the new club house and pitch which had, a week previously, hosted the boys under 16 and under 18 inter-pros and in March a series of women's internationals. But one comment from Dougie set me thinking .\" Visiting players don't stay around any more - they just arrive in their track suits and go away in them. \"But back to the Elks and they made a tremendous effort to make the occasion a special one although they were less welcoming on the pitch as\" Garvey will testify to. I was amazed to see half a dozen ball girls lined up around the pitch and all of them were wearing Elks gear under several other layers as they kept warm. Music blared out over the PA System before the start, at half time and at the end of an excellent game of hockey watched by a big crowd. It's a very user friendly club house as spectators who don't wish to brave the cold can watch in comfort from an elevated position with their favourite tipple in hand. After the game the Elks had laid on a meal for both teams and umpires, again to enhance the sense of occasion. But such occasions are, sadly, all too rare outside the two all Ireland competitions when visiting teams who have often travelled long distances are fed and watered as a matter of course. Also present at Saturday's game was Randalstown co-captain Louise Creighton, who was manning the club shop. She, too, laments the fact that it just isn't the same any more as far as the camaraderie between teams at domestic level is concerned. \"In the men's game opposition teams tend to make an effort to come in for a drink but I suppose in the women's game, it's because a lot of us don't have club houses and many teams play at Leisure Centres .\" she explained. \"Back in the old days we went back to the rugby club in Randalstown. Often then there were a lot of players from the surrounding area and (local) players were brought up through the club .\" Nowadays though there are a lot more school kids playing on women's teams and they often have Ulster or Irish training the next day. \"The pressure on these kids is immense and, quite, honestly I don't know how they do it .\" Due to work commitments I had to decline Louise's invitation to stay for some hospitality at Mossley's palatial club house and instead I headed to my normal base at Queen's Sport to put pen to paper, or more accurately, fingers to keyboard. The place was buzzing as players from opposing sides were sitting down to sandwiches and stew and enjoying each other's company in the club house which, like Mossley's, is superbly appointed. But it was the footballers of Queen's University and Glebe Rangers who were enjoying the \"craic' and there wasn't a hockey player in sight. Queen's Football Club always make a point of entertaining visiting teams although I am not sure if it is a widespread phenomenon outside of Upper Malone. But I know, from experience on other Saturday afternoons that it also applies to rugby when players and supporters from Queen's and their opposition are seen mingling together after matches. As dusk fell the footballers from both teams said their\" cheerios' and went their separate ways while I continued my work and it was one of those \"last out, please turn the lights out' occasions. However the bar would have remained open had any one else wanted to sample it's contents or merely sit around and have a chat in the club house. As I left, as if to illustrate the point, two women's hockey teams were trudging off one of the pitches and both sets of players headed straight for their cars without even considering the possibility of even the briefest bit of socialising. So well done to the Ulster Elks for trying to break the norm and making Saturday's Cup game a special occasion and to Mossley for their offer of hospitality - I will take it up next time and leave the lap top at home.

This year's Grammy nominations may be as muddled as usual, but the Recording Academy sent at least one straightforward message with the picks it announced Friday night: Rock music didn't matter in 2013. No rock albums made the shortlist for the Grammys' flagship album of the year prize, nor is a rock act among the nominees for best new artist; the rock performance category, meanwhile, is padded with a cut from a live disc documenting Led Zeppelin's one-off reunion gig. Grammys: Alternative R & B largely overlooked in nominations Live review: Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande light up KIIS-FM Jingle Ball PHOTOS: KROQ-FM's Almost Acoustic Christmas 2013 Yet if the academy has decided that rock is dead, its verdict didn't hold much sway Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium, where L.A.'s KROQ-FM (106.7) presented the first night of its annual Almost Acoustic Christmas extravaganza. Here a very rowdy capacity crowd had gathered to watch nine bands - including Kings of Leon, Vampire Weekend and Queens of the Stone Age - bash through five hours of songs filled with fuzzy guitars set to galloping beats. (Phoenix and Lorde are among the acts scheduled to perform Sunday night .) \"You know that I could use somebody,\" sang Caleb Followill of Kings of Leon, and at the Shrine he had no shortage of enthusiastic somebodys to reassure him of his value. Alas, the crowd was too kind. Though they sounded OK in their big hits \"Use Somebody\" and \"Sex on Fire,\" both more or less foolproof, Kings of Leon were appallingly dull in Saturday's headlining slot, a boring (and bored-looking) outfit with none of the live-wire intensity that Followill and his mates used to project. AFI was more energetic but equally uninspiring in its performance, which pulled from the long-running California quartet's recently released \"Burials .\" A decade ago, AFI was honing a sometimes-thrilling mixture of punk thrash and goth romance, but at Acoustic Christmas it merely barreled through its set, the band's old dynamism reduced to an insistent whine, even in its vintage hit \"Miss Murder .\" More encouraging sounds - and reason, perhaps, to believe that rock can still make an impact - came from Vampire Weekend, the deeply clever New York City band whose latest album, \"Modern Vampires of the City,\" is one of the year's most acclaimed. (It's up for the alternative music Grammy .) On Saturday, Drake's song \"Worst Behavior\" blasted from the Shrine's speakers as the band arrived onstage, and that was just one sign that Vampire Weekend was looking beyond rock's usual borders; its set pulled from rap, reggae and African pop as Ezra Koenig floated his boyish vocals over arrangements that mixed strummy acoustic guitar with percolating machine beats. Fifties-rebel cool in a denim jacket with the collar turned up, Koenig in \"Diane Young\" led his bandmates through a synthed-up revamp of early rock? la Buddy Holly - \"<mark>Peggy Sue</mark>\" for the Age of Spotify. <mark>Alex Turner</mark> of England's Arctic Monkeys had a similar look, with a greaser's pompadour and hip-hugging jeans. And his band's set likewise juiced old forms, pairing Black Sabbath-style guitar licks with slowed-down grooves out of hip-hop and R & B; it was as sensual as it was menacing. Ditto Queens of the Stone Age, whose frontman Josh Homme has served lately as a kind of spirit guide for Arctic Monkeys. At the Shrine he sang merrily about drug use - \"nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol,\" as he put it specifically in \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" - while the rest of the group found inventive ways to give heavy metal a feeling of luxury. \"We're the drunkest band on the lineup,\" Homme said by way of introduction, and at this the audience roared its approval once again - in this case cheering an act with a clear sense of purpose.

Eurozone industrial output slumps Putin defends conservative values Thousands queue to bid sad farewell as Mandela lies in state Mourners pay respects to Mandela Barcelona that the referendum would ask the region's voters if they want Catalonia to be a state and, if so, should it be independent. Mr Mas did not clarify the distinction between a state and an independent state. However, the questions appeared to open a door for those nationalists who want Catalonia to have the structure of a state but remain a part of Spain, possibly along the lines of Puerto Rico and the United States. Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz Gallardon responded to Mr Mas' announcement, saying a referendum would be illegal and would not be allowed. Spain's Constitution says only the central government in Mariano Rajoy recently rejected a request by Mr Mas to allow one. The government has not said what it might do to prevent a ballot. Mr Mas said the referendum date was set almost a year away so as to give ample time for negotiations with Madrid on \"the way to stage the consultation legally .\" Polls indicate that Catalans are roughly evenly split on independence. The European Union and Nato have warned Catalonia it would be excluded if it seceded. Scotland is staging an independence referendum next year, on September 18. That vote has been approved by the British government. Mr Mas began pushing for a referendum after he failed to clinch a better financial pact for Catalonia with the central government in 2012. The referendum proposal got the support of some one million people who turned out at two demonstrations held since then. The possibility of a region having the right to decide its future has stirred much political debate and raised questions as to whether it is time to reform the 1978 constitution to ease territorial discontent. The Basque region, which has traditionally sought greater powers, failed in a bid to hold a self-determination referendum several years ago. Catalonia is one of the country's most powerful regions and represents roughly a fifth of Spain's 1.1 trillion euro (? 930 bn) GDP. Its population of 7.5 million is greater than those of EU members such as Denmark, Ireland or Finland. The region, like others in Spain, has its own language as well as Spanish. Its financial powers include some tax collecting rights.

(\"Nighthawk\" ) (TSX VENTURE: NHK) is pleased to announce it has entered into a binding option agreement, with Geomark Exploration Ltd. (\"Geomark\" ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine Cliff Energy Ltd., to acquire 4 contiguous mining leases adjacent to Nighthawk's existing property in the Northwest Territories (\"NWT\" ) (Figure 1). HIGHLIGHTS:--Agreement encompasses the Kim and Cass gold deposits (Figure 2) as well as multiple other prospects within the Indin Lake Greenstone Belt;--Kim and Cass represent the final strategic properties to be incorporated into Nighthawk's Indin Lake Gold Project;--Nighthawk's land package will increase in size by 7,588 acres to 229,791 acres total;--Over 32,000 metres of reported historic drilling completed with much of the core remaining intact. Drilling highlights from the Cass Zone include intercepts of:--81.55 metres of 4.50 grams per tonne (\"g/t\" ) gold from hole C87-35;--52.00 metres of 5.10 g/t gold from hole C95-06;--64.40 metres of 4.08 g/t gold from hole C87-23; and--Prior to the implementation of NI 43-101, previous work conducted on the properties defined historic gold resource estimates of significant grade and continuity that have yet to be fully evaluated. Nighthawk President & CEO, David Wiley, commented, \"In this challenging market environment, we remain committed to adding value for our shareholders. We are fortunate to have a healthy balance sheet, a low cash burn rate and now the final strategic pieces of what we believe is a world class gold camp. These leases contain the Kim and Cass deposits plus numerous drill ready targets where previous owners have already completed a significant amount of work. We believe the historical data may be sufficient to apply towards our next resource estimate update and we will be working with the author of our technical report to incorporate this new information .\" Figure 1. - Location Map of Leases Optioned from Geomark Under the agreement with Geomark, Nighthawk has optioned 4 contiguous mining leases which include the Kim and Cass gold deposits and other gold showings. On signing the agreement, Nighthawk granted Geomark a 2.5% net smelter royalty on the 4 leases (of which 1.5% can be repurchased for $1,500,000) and paid $250,000, one-half of which is to be satisfied through the issuance of 1,768,345 common shares of Nighthawk. Subsequent option payments totalling $1,300,000 are staged in tranches over the next three years as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due Date Payment---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2014 $300,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2015 $450,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2016 $550,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nighthawk has the right to satisfy one-half of each of the option payments in common shares, subject to receipt of requisite approval including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange should Nighthawk elect to issue common shares. Upon making the final payment, Nighthawk will own 100% of the mining leases. Property Highlights Historical Resource Estimates The Kim Main Zone, hosted by mafic volcanic rocks, and the Cass Zone, hosted by gabbro, represent significant underexplored gold deposits within the Indin Lake Gold Camp. Several historical resource estimates that pre-date the implementation of NI 43-101, were calculated for each of the deposits. The most recent of these was compiled in 1995 by 1Royal Oak Mines Inc. (\"Royal Oak\" ), the previous operator of the Colomac Gold Mine. They reported a possible geological resource based upon relatively shallow drilling (150 metres) for the Cass and Kim Zones presented in Table 1 below. Table 1. Historical Resource Estimate for Cass and Kim Zones Zone Cutoff (g/t) Tonnes Grade (g/t) Ounces Au---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cass 1.00 1,919,518 2.43 150,228 Kim (Main) 1.50 937,575 3.15 95,082---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total 2,857,093 2.66 245,311 A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify any of the historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined by NI 43-101; consequently, they should not be relied upon. The Company is not treating the historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves as defined by NI 43-101. Cass Zone The Cass Zone is located approximately 20 kilometres southwest of Colomac, hosted within a northeast trending gabbro sill. Mineralization is characterized by a stockwork of quartz-carbonate veins with minor pyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite. In excess of 13,500 metres of historic drilling into the zone has defined mineralization over a strike length of 360 metres and to a depth of 210 metres. Royal Oak intended to place the Cass Zone into production and process the ore at the Colomac Mill, but the company closed the Colomac operation before production from the Cass Zone began. Select drill intercepts from the Cass Zone are reported in Table 1 below. These are historical in nature and Nighthawk has not independently verified the results; consequently, these results should not be relied upon. Table 2.

True widths are unknown at this time. Kim Main Zone The Kim Main Zone, located approximately 15 kilometres southwest of Nighthawk's past producing Colomac Gold Mine, lies within a sequence of northerly striking, steeply dipping, mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks. Mineralization is hosted by intercalated, massive and pillowed mafic volcanics and has been traced over a strike length of 650 metres and to depths of up to 150 metres vertically. Near surface mineralization is offset by a north-south trending, 45 degree late reverse fault, but historical drilling is reported to have intersected mineralization below the fault and the zone remains open at depth. Over 18,000 metres of historic drilling is documented for the Kim Main Zone. 19th Hole Zone and Albatross Zone Two occurrences, the 19th Hole Zone, located 300 metres to the southwest of the Cass Zone, and the Albatross Zone, located 500 metres further to the southwest, appear to be extensions of the Cass Zone. Both the Albatross Zone and the 19th Hole Zone are defined by an area of extensive quartz-carbonate veining in gabbro with associated pyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite identical to that of the Cass Zone. 19th Hole Zone Historic surface trench samples collected from the 19th Hole showing assayed 15.9 g/t gold and 11.58 g/t gold over widths greater than 1 metre. Two other samples had values of 5.5 g/t gold over similar widths. Albatross Zone The Albatross occurrence is located entirely within Nighthawk ground and appears to represent a continuance of the Cass Deposit mineralization. Historical channel samples from a trench across the zone returned assay results up to 9.7 g/t gold over 1 metre. 1 Archibald, D.L., and Kulas, J. P., 1995.

There is little doubt that Big Data solutions will have an increasing role in the Enterprise IT mainstream over time. Get a jump on that rapidly evolving trend at Big Data Expo, which we are introducing in November at Cloud Expo New York. \"Cloud\" has become synonymous with \"computing\" and \"software\" in two short years. Cloud Expo is the new PC Expo, Comdex, and InternetWorld of our decade. By 2012, more than 50,000 delegates per year will participate in Cloud Expo worldwide. The cloud is certainly a compelling alternative to running all applications within a traditional corporate data center. But moving from theory into practice is where things get complicated, and this is where attending a top industry event like Cloud Expo comes in. No one can take full advantage of cloud computing without first becoming familiar with the latest issues and trends, which is why the organizing principle of the 10th International Cloud Expo on June 10-12, 2014 - is to ensure - through an intensive three-day schedule of keynotes, general and breakout sessions, and our bustling Expo Floor - that attending delegates leave the Javits Center with abundant resources, ideas and examples they can apply immediately to leveraging the Cloud, helping them to maximize performance, minimize cost and improve the scalability of their Enterprise IT endeavors. Delegates will leave Cloud Expo with dramatically increased understanding the entire scope of the entire cloud computing spectrum from storage to security. Whether you're an enterprise or small to medium business, you'll soon be benefiting from the Cloud. Join your peers in New York June 10-12, and maximize those benefits already in 2014.

Wayne Rooney: Hailed for his leadership qualities Rooney, who was an injury doubt before this weekend's game, was instrumental in United's 3-1 win over West Ham and Moyes believes the England international is now playing a key role in helping his team-mates improve. Moyes has been impressed by Rooney's attitude since taking over at Old Trafford and believes the 28-year-old is showing more maturity on his way to becoming a true United great as he enters his tenth year at the club. \"Do you know what I see more than anything in Wayne? I see leadership,\" said Moyes. \"I see somebody who wants to take responsibility for the team. I see somebody who cares for how he plays and how the team plays. More than anything, that is what I see from Wayne .\" Maybe if he is not quite at the top of his form I will need him to drop in at times and he has no problem doing any of the jobs. He is getting to an age now where he realises he is not a boy any more. He is one of the senior men in the team. He is actually on the verge of being one of the great legends at this club.
