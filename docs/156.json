budget reduction - was 2005 when $40 billion was cut over five years .\" we are doing more than three times that. \"<mark>ryan</mark> reminds me,\" defense secretary [leon] panetta said [the defense cuts] would be \"devastating .'\" so the house is going through the budget, focusing especially on so-called mandatory spending. this isn't just an academic exercise, <mark>ryan</mark> says: \"the purpose is to be specific with the american people .\" as for alternatives to sequestration, <mark>ryan</mark> notes that the office of management and budget, the senate and the white house \"have none .\" he stresses that in putting up a concrete substitute for sequestration of defense funds, \"we are doing what leaders do .\" that entails coming up with cuts of 405 percent (over five years) of the total of one year of sequestration cuts. he explains that much of this is obtained by removing duplicative programs and practicing good government. for example, currently there are 47 overlapping job training programs spread across 9 different government agencies. on food stamps, <mark>ryan</mark> would block grant the program for greater efficiency as was done with welfare reform in the 1990's. food stamp spending has increased by 270%. under <mark>ryan</mark>'s reforms to curb waste, pair back the failed stimulus, and end duplication food stamp spending would still be 260% higher in 2013 than in 2002. . <mark>ryan</mark> says his proposal does include some basics: \"you need to be eligible in order to receive food stamps .\" in other cases, <mark>ryan</mark>'s proposal would shut down what he calls \"slush funds,\" for example the bailout monies in the dodd-frank legislation, and shut down inefficient bureaucracies (e.g. the office of financial research) or bloated ones that don't target those in need (e.g. federal flood insurance). <mark>ryan</mark> is candid that after the house does its work \"it will go on the shelf .\" nevertheless, he adds, \"it will show we are prepared to lead .\" and he doesn't rule out the possibility some of this could be accomplished in the lame duck session (\"it depends who wins .\" ) as for the presidential race, he says he has been in touch with the romney campaign: \"they're pleased to see we are leading. they are pleased to see we have put out specifics .\" <mark>ryan</mark> says the president's rhetoric is \"so politically crass. we're used to it. we're used to the demagoguery .\" he continues, \"i really think people will grow tired of it. it's cynical divide - and-conquer politics,\" in contrast to romney's \"uplifting, unifying message\" and totally different vision is precisely the way to go. romney is putting out a pro-growth, pro-free market vision. <mark>ryan</mark> says that in contrast to romney, \"the president thinks life is a zero sum game. he thinks the economy is a zero sum game .\" if someone gets ahead, in obama's view, it was because someone else got less or was exploited. <mark>ryan</mark> says, \"that's not how it works .\" in part two of the interview, <mark>ryan</mark> talks about immigration reform, entitlement reform and the choice in the 2012 election.", "articleID": "2012050921_00024870_W", "names": {"Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"]}}, {"date": "2012-02-29", "url": "http://denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20063447?source=rss", "content": "with all the news focused on warren buffett's annual shareholders' letter, it was easy to miss jeremy grantham's more urgent missive. like buffett, grantham is a legendary value investor. he's co-founder of boston-based investment firm, gmo llc, which manages $97 billion. that's about half the market value of berkshire hathaway inc., but still big enough to produce a noteworthy letter. buffett, in his widely anticipated letter, is content to repeat platitudes, such as \"america's best days lie ahead .\" the oracle of omaha proclaimed \"the banking industry was back on its feet\" and even managed to find the bright side of foreclosures: \"large numbers of people who have\" lost' their house through foreclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash in excess of their cost. \"grantham, however, takes a longer view, and isn't so\" awe-shucks \"about the future of our broken economic system .\" capitalism, \"he writes,\" threatens our existence. \"already, capitalism is proving that karl marx and friedrich engels were at least partially correct. they\" looked forward to globalization and the supranational company because they argued it would make capitalism even more powerful, over reaching, and eventually reckless, \"grantham writes. globalization\" would...offer the capitalists more rope to hang themselves with...rope...bought from briskly competing capitalists, eager till the end for a good deal. \"grantham, who is british, studied economics at the university of sheffield and got his mba from harvard business school. he started his investment career as an economist with royal dutch shell before starting gmo in 1977. he says capitalism does almost everything better than any other economic system. it's just that its two or three main flaws are potentially fatal and have gone largely unaddressed. a sustainable economic system, for instance, can't be based on ever-increasing debt, corporations can't be allowed to run governments and loot treasuries, and\" growth at any cost \"is a recipe for planetary suicide. here are some of grantham's finer points:? capitalism too heavily discounts the future value of cash flows as it seeks to raise debts:\" your grandchildren have no value. \"? companies foolishly reward executives for taking on debt:\" total remuneration...for senior officers...rose as a percentage of the average worker's pay from 40 times in eisenhower's era to over 600 times today with no indication of any general improvement in talent. \"? it's about profits, not people:\" capitalism in general has no sense of ethics or conscience. whatever the supreme court may think, it is not a person. \"? the more people borrow, the more they just gamble:\" leverage...increases your returns over and over until, suddenly, it ruins you ....there are no investors anonymous meetings to attend. \"? this time, it's not so different:\" ignore the...inevitable cheerleaders who will assure you that this time it's a new high plateau...even if that view comes from the federal reserve itself. no. make that, especially if it comes from there. \"? washington is becoming a corporate subsidiary:\" what capitalism has always had is money with which to try to buy influence ....the issues they influence are precisely...the ones that are most important to society's...very existence. \"? big companies can't help it:\" ethical ceos can drag a company along for a while, but this is an undependable and temporary fix. \"? economic theory ignores natural laws. it suffers an\" absolute inability to process the finiteness of resources ....capitalism wants to eat into...limited resources at an accelerating rate with the subtext that everyone on the planet has the right to live like the wasteful polluting developed countries do today. \"? it's not just inexpensive oil we are running out of: the\" loss of our collective ability to feed ourselves, through erosion and fertilizer depletion -

well-funded junior exploration company focused on establishing ree, uranium and other rare metal resources through exploration and property acquisition. with multiple projects across north america, ucore's primary focus is the 100% owned bokan - dotson ridge ree property in alaska. the bokan - dotson ridge ree project is located 60 km southwest of ketchikan, alaska and 140 km northwest of prince rupert, british columbia and has direct ocean access to the western seaboard and the pacific rim, a significant advantage in expediting mine production and limiting the capital costs associated with mine construction. the bokan properties are located in an area reserved for sustainable resource development with an existing road network providing access to the main target areas. ree mineralization at the bokan-dotson ridge project occurs in a well-demarcated vein system related to a mesozoic bokan peralkaline granitic complex. however, a number of other occurrences of ree mineralization are also located within, or at the margins of the complex. viewed in a geological and geophysical context, the bokan complex is a distinctive circular structure and is highly prospective for rare earths deposits. <mark>jim mckenzie</mark>, president and ceo this press release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\". all statements in this release, other than

opposition to same-sex marriage wednesday, as the filipino superstar tried to quiet the storm. more coverage for more boxing news and analysis, check out the boxing tribune. pacquiao sparked a flurry of headlines in an interview earlier this week by disagreeing with president barack obama's view that gay couples should be allowed to marry--calling it a direct attack on the morals of society and the will of god. the devout christian said wednesday he is not against homosexuality, just same-sex marriage. \"i'm not against gay people,\" pacquiao said in a statement. \"i have a relative who is also gay. we can't help it if they were born that way. what i'm critical of are actions that violate the word of god. i only gave out my opinion that same-sex marriage is against the law of god .\" however his clarification was not enough to stop to another online confrontation with mayweather. fans of the sport have long called for the pair to match up against each other in the ring--but neither camp has agreed to the other's demands thus far, and the pair do most of their fighting through the media. mayweather tweeted wednesday evening, \"i stand behind president obama & support gay marriage. i'm an american citizen & i believe people should live their life the way they want .\" in his statement earlier in the day, pacquiao, who is training for a june 9 fight against undefeated american timothy bradley, also maintained he never made a reference to the bible's book of leviticus when interviewed. the writer who conducted the interview for examiner.com included the passage from leviticus stating, \"if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads .\" pacquiao, who is a lawmaker in his native philippines, said, \"i didn't say that, that's a lie...i didn't know that quote from leviticus because i haven't read the book of leviticus yet .\" the writer, granville ampong, has since said pacquiao never referenced the passage, although his article suggested the boxer had agreed with it. amidst the fallout from the interview, a popular los angeles entertainment complex nixed an interview between the boxer and <mark>mario lopez</mark> of \"extra,\" according to kcbs-tv. boxing's first-ever eight-division champion was slated to appear at the grove wednesday afternoon, and both men had tweeted invitations for fans to watch the filming. the grove, which is owned by prominent los angeles developer rick caruso, cited the 33-year-old boxer's \"intolerance\" in its decision to cancel the taping. \"based on news reports of statements made by mr. pacquiao we have made it be known that he is not welcome at the grove and will not be interviewed here now or in the future,\" read a statement from grove vice president of corporate affairs bill reich. posted: may 13, 2012 american <mark>michael hunter</mark> wins gold in an olympic qualifier over argentina's
