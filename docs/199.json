front by selecting utah's star lotulelei with the 14th overall pick in general manager dave gettleman's first nfl draft. it marks the first time the panthers have selected a defensive tackle in the first round since joining the league in 1995. defensive tackle was considered a position of need for the panthers, who released starter <mark>ron edwards</mark> in a salary cap move earlier this offseason. lotulelei, 6-foot-2 and 311 pounds, is expected to step in and start right away alongside veteran defensive tackle dwan edwards, who re-signed in the offseason. gettleman called lotulelei a three-down lineman. \"what star does is he impacts the game on every snap in terms of the run game and the pass game,\" gettleman said. \"he's not someone you are going to replace in your sub package defense .\" gettleman likes the idea that lotulelei can occupy two players at the point of attack, which he hopes will free up middle linebacker luke kuechly to make even more plays. kuechly, the 2012 ap defensive rookie of the year, led the nfl in tackles last season. \"it gives luke more protection, which makes our whole defense better,\" gettleman said. in his last two seasons at utah, lotulelei had 20 of his 86 tackles behind the line of scrimmage and posted 6.5 sacks. he also forced four tackles. \"we think he's going to be an impact player for us as far as our front is concerned,\" coach <mark>ron rivera</mark> said. \"he's a guy that will command the double teams and can split the double teams as well as hold them point, which will give our linebackers an opportunity to run .\" it will affect the way we play pass coverage when you've got two guys up front in he and dwan that will be able to push the pocket for us. \"the panthers finished 10th in the league on defense last season and 14th against the run. at the scouting combine in february a heart test revealed his left ventricle was pumping at only 44 percent efficiency, thus clouding his future in the nfl. but following a variety of tests, including those by a cardiologist specialist in utah, it was revealed that a virus was causing the abnormal heartbeat. medication cured the problem .\" he was thoroughly checked out, \"gettleman said .\" our doctors felt very comfortable that he's fine. he's been completely cleared. \"lotulelei said it was a scary situation at the time .\" it was definitely a big blow, \"the soft-spoken lotulelei said .\" but it ended up just being a virus i had from a cold. but everything has been cleared and i'm ready to go. i'm ready to get down there and get to work. \"a native of tonga, the 23-year-old lotulelei is already married and has two daughters. lotulelei hails from the same school as two current panthers stars - <mark>steve smith</mark> and <mark>jordan

aston villa backlash after swindon incident having his say: the then swindon town manager paolo di canio reacts to aston villa's fans at the end of the game at the county ground paolo di canio can expect a hot reception next week from aston villa fans who feel they were taunted by the colourful italian on their last meeting. villa fans were incensed last october after the premier league side beat swindon 3-2 in the capital one cup at the county ground to see di canio approach them and seemingly suggesting swindon would be going up this season and villa would be relegated. but di canio insisted that that was not the case and he was merely praising robins' fans for the quality of their support in an eventful cup tie. the then swindon boss had watched his side storm back from a 2-0 deficit to level, only for villa striker christian benteke to score a match-winner to send his team into the last eight of the competition. and when the subject was raised post-match about villa supporters' fury at what they saw as baiting, he insisted: \"no, that was not the case .\" i was saying to my fans that they had been brilliant and their support was so good that they were up there and villa were below them. \"to see the county ground full of emotion when we scored the second goal was amazing .\" i was saying it was my fans that are the top and they are underneath you.

balancing competing issues well regarding the april 21 point of view piece \"a paler shade of orange\" : apparently <mark>michael jacobs</mark> has chosen to use statistics to reinforce what he already thinks even if the facts don't fit his assertions. to read his piece, one would believe orange county is a willfully elitist outlier in north carolina, promulgating policies that drive away people of color and expend tax dollars to no particular purpose. the professor takes pains to identify a decline in the county's african-american population over the last decade, throws together a hodgepodge of other stats and concludes that \"a community that preaches social inclusion enacts policies of economic exclusion .\" he conveniently fails to mention that, in the span of a decade governed by orange county's supposedly anti-inclusionary policies, its asian population nearly doubled, its \"hispanic or latino\" population (census terms) more than doubled and the percentage of white population decreased. that must mean our policies aren't a barrier to inclusion after all. as for where all that tax revenue goes, orange is among state leaders in the percentage of the county budget devoted to public education. despite sustained enrollment growth in both of our excellent school systems, and a continued decline in school construction funds from the state, we've kept up with providing the high-dollar school buildings necessary to accommodate reasonable class sizes. we are careful stewards of taxpayer dollars. we have a rigorous policy limiting debt and a strong fund balance, resulting in one of the highest bond ratings of any county in north carolina. and we haven't raised property taxes in four years. we know our poverty rate and cost of living remain too high, situations we're addressing in the face of historical, political and market-based forces we often cannot control. even in these anti-tax times, a healthy debate can be had regarding the limits and merits of public spending and government policy. but <mark>jacobs</mark> seems more eager to paint orange county leaders as business and social bogeymen (and women) than to grasp current realities or to appreciate the complexities of balancing competing local imperatives in an era of shrinking resources. chairman, orange county commissioners, the length limit was waived to provide a fuller

to bounce back facing medlen, braves though the tigers were on the winning end of friday's 10-0 series opener against the braves, seeing those numbers on the scoreboard may have brought back some bad memories for detroit's saturday starter, rick porcello. that was the exact score by which the tigers lost in porcello's last outing, which lasted less than one full inning. last saturday, porcello was tagged for nine runs on nine hits while lasting just two-thirds of an inning in his start against the angels. \"a little rusty, a little wild, a little unlucky,\" manager jim leyland said in characterizing porcello's disastrous start. \"and that pretty much sums it up .\" the unlucky part stemmed from the fact that all but one of the nine hits allowed by porcello were singles, with three not leaving the infield and three more finding their way up the middle on the ground. the only extra-base hit against porcello was a mike trout grand slam that ended the right-hander's day after 47 pitches and just two outs. \"i think we've all had games where guys are hitting the ball hard just right at [defenders],\" porcello said after the game, \"and you cruise through seven innings or whatever and you walk away feeling pretty good about it, but you didn't throw the ball that well. today, i felt like i threw the ball fine. it just wasn't in the cards for me .\" the braves, meanwhile, will counter with right-hander kris medlen, who--in spite of a 2.16 era--has already recorded more losses (two) in four starts this season than he did all of last year. that, however, is more of a testament to his dominant 2012 campaign than anything else. following his 10-1 record and 1.57 era in 50 appearances (12 starts) a season ago, medlen has experienced little drop-off this season, regardless of the two losses. medlen allowed just two runs over five innings, but he received zero runs of support in taking his first loss of the season in his season debut. then after allowing just one combined earned run in a pair of seven-inning performances in his previous two outings, medlen was saddled with his other defeat sunday after conceding three runs over six innings of work. braves: <mark>mccann</mark> homers twice in first rehab game catcher <mark>brian mccann</mark> homered in each of his first two at-bats friday with class a rome in his first game action since offseason shoulder surgery. he finished the game 2-for-3 with a pair of walks to go with his two homers. the current plan is to have <mark>mccann</mark>, who would be permitted to play up to 20 games in his rehab stint, play five games with rome, then approximately another five with triple-a gwinnett before making his return. though he's been able to swing without any issues for more than a month, <mark>mccann</mark> has been focused on regaining his arm strength following the surgery. \"the reports on him are that he is up to 180 feet throwing and it was really, really good,\" manager fredi gonzalez said. tigers: coke dealing with groin strain reliever phil coke was unavailable friday night due to a left groin strain, and his status for the rest of the weekend is up in the air. coke initially felt the strain while throwing a pitch in thursday's outing, during which he took the loss after allowing four runs on one hit and four walks over 1 1/3 innings of work. \"he's better today and so he's kind of a day-to-day guy at this point in time,\" head athletic trainer kevin rand said friday afternoon, \"but it'll probably be a couple days .\" worth noting tigers infielder jhonny peralta has reached base safely in each of his last 14 games. peralta is hitting .364 (20-for-55) with three doubles, a home run and nine rbis over the 14 games. @ paul_casella. this story was not

admitted several scottish hospitals could face closure - because the buildings are too old to care for patients. three nhs lothian hospitals - astley ainslie, corstorphine and liberton - are under threat because they don't provide the \"optimal setting for patient care\". officials said the closures don't pose any threat as more patients are being treated outside of hospitals. but as closures were being discussed the health secretary <mark>alex neil</mark> said more beds are needed to deal with an ageing population. critics accused health bosses of \"singing from different hymn sheets\" and questioned the snp's pledge of maintaining crucial bed numbers. the closures were announced at the same time a planning document set out nhs lothian's priorities over the next eight years. the report stated fewer hospital beds may be required as more patients are set to be treated in the community. bed numbers in lothian across all specialities have been slashed by almost 20% in the last decade from 4445 in 2003 to 3655 in 2012. nhs lothian said it is committed to its major hospitals but can make no guarantees over the smaller sites of astley ainslie, corstorphine and liberton - which have only 467 bed between them. the health board said the buildings \"provide less than optimal setting for patient care\" and that it would now look at \"opportunities to safely move off sites .\" but mr <mark>neil</mark> told workers at a unison conference in glasgow that a growing older population would mean the same number of beds in hospitals would be needed. labour lothians msp sarah boyack called for clarity on the contradicting messages. she said: \"<mark>alex neil</mark> is saying we need the same number of beds to cope with demographic change, yet nhs lothian is talking about reducing bed numbers. it seems like they are singing from different hymn sheets .\" scottish tory health spokesman jackson carlow also accused nhs lothian and mr <mark>neil</mark> of sending out mixed messages. he said: \"there has been no end of negative news stories from nhs lothian about capacity pressure and other issues, how can it come to the conclusion it can afford to cut more beds is beyond me .\" in response mr <mark>neil</mark> said: \"even if we are able, through better treatment at home, to reduce by 50% the level of hospitalisation of our elderly population, we are still going to need the same number of beds, the same number of hospitals, the same number of doctors and nurses just to stand still because this population [over 75s] is doubling .\" professor <mark>alex</mark> mcmahon, director of strategic planning at nhs lothian said the board was committed to modern facilities, and there would be a rise in beds at the edinburgh royal infirmary. he said: \"we will review our current methods of care and make decisions on maintaining, expanding, refurbishing or replacing facilities to ensure we have the right mix of inpatient beds and capacity in the community to meet the needs of the growing population .\" a spokeswoman for the scottish government said: \"we are committed to at least maintaining the level of quality and provision in scotland's nhs - and that means having the right numbers of staff and beds, in the right place .\" all health boards continually work to shape their services to best meet the care needs of their local populations. \"short url: in brief. you can follow any responses to this entry through the sheena williamson: i'm not surprised. i have worked in the healthcare sector for years and am astounded

"http://zdnet.com/apple-versus-microsoft-the-ticker-tape-tells-the-tale-7000014556?s_cid=e539&ttag=e539", "content": "windows 8 was released to the general public exactly six months ago. during that time, the pc industry has contracted sharply and windows 8 buyers have been less than fully enthusiastic. the conventional wisdom is that microsoft is flailing and apple is a productivity machine. apple's products are uniformly loved and microsoft's are unable to get any traction. apple's cool, microsoft's not. and yet the company's stock prices have gone in completely opposite directions since the launch of windows 8. this chart begins on the day windows 8 was released to the public. now, the market has been known to be dead wrong before. but it's odd to see this big a divergence between public perception and market performance. last week microsoft released its quarterly results. this week apple weighed in with its numbers. that gave me a chance to look at both companies in a little more detail. and when i did, i saw far more similarities than differences, including two ceos who have drawn their share of fire from critics who think they need to be replaced. at microsoft, steve ballmer gets dinged for the company's inability to make any serious inroads into the mobile category. after six months on the market, neither windows phone 8 nor windows 8 have managed to get out of the single digits in terms of usage. and yet the company managed to increase its profit 19 percent over the corresponding quarter last year. how? by concentrating on the boring, yet highly profitable units that most tech bloggers yawn at. microsoft business division (responsible for office 365, which is about to become a billion-dollar business) and server and tools (with multiple billion-dollar businesses under its umbrella) are both bigger than windows. meanwhile, the windows division reported flat revenues even though pc shipments dropped by 14 percent during the same period. i've read several critiques from armchair financial analysts implying that ballmer and co. are somehow cheating by including its new surface hardware line in the windows division's results. but that's microsoft's strategy for windows, part of its initiative to become a \"devices and services\" company. you can argue about the execution of that strategy, and you can place bets on whether it will succeed. but there's nothing timid or tentative about it. and then there's apple. superficially, its business looks as diversified as microsoft's, with revenue and profits coming from a variety of products. but in the same quarter where microsoft's profits were up 19 percent, apple's were down almost 18 percent. there's no question that apple will sell lots more iphones and ipads. but as ceo <mark>tim cook</mark> acknowledged on the earnings call, \"we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012 .\" in developed markets, apple has masterfully executed against its plan to sell high-priced, high-margin products to the wealthier segments of the buying public. but there's evidence that that market is saturated, and the first-mover advantage is gone. on the same earnings call, <mark>cook</mark> conceded as much: \"we can't control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures .\" growth for apple in its existing product lines means appealing to more price-conscious buyers and moving into markets where the $618 average selling price of an iphone isn't an option. is there another breakthrough hardware product in apple's back pocket? it's hard to believe that a smart watch or a tv has the potential to define a category as the iphone and ipad did. maybe services? revenue on the itunes/software/services line in apple's just-completed quarter was up 30 percent. but as the latest 10-q report makes clear, that's a by-product of the larger installed base of ios devices: this increase was due primarily to growth of itunes [which] reflects continued growth in the installed base of ios devices and expanded itunes digital content and applications offerings around the world, resulting in higher net sales on the app store and higher net sales of digital content. outside of itunes, apple hasn't exactly excelled at delivering services to its own customer base, let alone expanding those services to a larger market. so it's hard to see that as a real growth opportunity. indeed, that's the real difference between steve ballmer's microsoft and <mark>tim cook</mark>'s apple. ballmer has a significant challenge in one division that represents about a quarter of his company's revenue, while other divisions are growing steadily outside the gaze of the gadget-obsessed tech press. meanwhile, apple has become downright boring and predictable. as felix salmon today's earnings report marks the point at which apple is officially no longer a high-growth tech stock, valued on its monster potential. instead, it has become a cash cow, valued on its ability to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into its shareholders' pockets. that's actually a fairly accurate description of microsoft's performance in the ballmer era. and given the challenges of the economy and a fickle technology market, it's a significant accomplishment for both men. ed bott ed bott is an award-winning technology writer with more than two decades' experience writing for mainstream media outlets and online publications. imagine a document and it is shipped off instantly...first i never saw george do that, second what the hell are you talking about? google \"microsoft cooler than apple\" looks like to most, other than you, microsoft is seen as cooler today than in many moons. that being said, some typewriters were pretty neat. you know, it's typical here for people to equate proprietary with features. actually, by not using active-x, alternatives just as applications, contrary to ms office which is deeply entrenched into the os, similar to internet explorer. confusing proprietary to essential feature is born from microsofts' monopolistic tendencies, nothing more. how ironic and ridiculous to make an apples-to-oranges comparison type analogy by referring to the price of cows and goats. the author was not, for example, comparing the price of an iphone to the price of a microsoft surface pro. he specifically was looking at common measures of both companies? revenue growth or decline rates, stock price rise or decline rates, etc. how ironic also for this commentator to be talking about others' state of denial when in fact he is ignoring the actual growth in microsoft revenues in absolute and relative terms. i suggest refresher courses, e.g. comparisons 101, irony 101, reality 101, etc.; -) way up overall. way up on office 365. way up on cloud services. way up on server systems. windows flat. wp8 only slightly up. the point is that microsoft redesigned itself years ago to be ready for a shift away from windows. they will do fine. and maybe they will even get some traction. who knows?? remember windows live? countless of cloud-based services too many to count with little popularity, they've bundles all * of those into windows 8 because they weren't making a name for themselves as services and microsoft's products were fractured, they're all in windows 8 now (including zune which they call xbox music & xbox video now), even bing is big in windows 8, if there's anything to microsoft, it's that they preserve everything, no matter how much they've failed, microsoft keeps supporting them. * = many windows live services have feen merged, example: windows live mesh, windows live skydrive and several \"minor -\" services have been merged into microsoft skydrive. if windows 8 is an indication of anything, it's that microsoft believes in windows, and thinks \"windows 8 is the way to the cloud\". if i understand you correctly you practically hate microsoft for allowing integrated search, skydrive, cloud sync et al. actually it is a great way to connect windows to the cloud which people will be using more and more every day. windows live was no failure (hotmail, live mail, skydrive, msn messenger, office web apps), they were used more than comparable services. having all of those present without any additional downloads is brilliant. something i've wanted since xp. @ stevenababy see? this guy here is the most common kind of prime example of really stupid writing, talking like he has a point, actually says nothing substantive, but makes a claim, a claim by the way provably and obviously wrong, but says it as if he means it and as if its based on some common truth. its obvious and uncontestable crap. his claim: \"face it ed, the world is beginning to realize that it can live without windows and office\" the world is beginning to realize no such thing. what a joke. neither the particular business i am in or any of the businesses i have been through nor any of the homes or anyplace ive been to over the years seems to have had any so called \"realization' that windows isnt needed. what a load of guff. its like someone took a pile of nonsense and distilled it down to its finest form. what the world may have realized is that you don't need windows to run a cell phone or tablet. this in itself is a joke. its like saying\" the united states is beginning to realize that you don't need russian built rockets to go into outer space \". ummm? i don't get it? are you claiming they just recently came to realize this? like? didn' t the u.s.a. go to the moon or something already without russian rockets? like, a bunch of years back? and similarly, when did the world ever think that windows was needed for a cell phone or a tablet??? my guess would be something like the 12th of never. it seems to me that the whole world in so far as business and home use of windows goes that years ago they would walk into best buy and look at desktop computers and laptop computers, there been an area for macs for some time. if they were not buying a mac they were buying a windows computer. sometimes, although we know rarely, people will now sometimes buy a chromebook. we know that people don't buy nearly as many desktops and laptops as in the past because everyone already has one. and we know, just exactly like the\" good old days \"about 90% of the computers sold are still windows computers. it dosnt fly in any sense of the term that the world is coming to realize that they don't need windows. its just impossible given the facts that the world actually knows exists. hopers and dreamers that want windows and usually ms to disappear and die use such phrases based on the fact non windows os tablets and cell phones have sold amazingly well, but it has shown absolutely nothing to the notion the world can get by without windows. nothing, as like in not a thing. its like saying that now we have airplanes and submarines the world is coming to realize we don't need automobiles. we know why people say these really stupid things. it allows them to dream of a world in the near future where things are more like the way they would like them to be. it gives some fertile ground for them to hope and dream there is some rational belief for thinking that their dream world is somehow closer to a reality than it actually is. the world still needs windows every bit as much as they always have. at least certainly in general. and worse yet for the ridiculous dreamers who for odd reasons hate windows and ms so much they live to exist in this dream world, is that we are not really much closer in significant ways to being any closer to any kind of world that can get by without windows yet. cayble, a very well written and thought out piece. my only thoughts are: for pretty much every windows hater, there are an equal amount of apple haters, which is very evident on this site, whom also want to see the demise of apple. what many of these haters don't seem to understand, is that we really don't need or should want any company to go down, the resulting effects it has on everyone is bad. people will be out of a job in an economy that is already strained enough, and then the other businesses that deal with those products also loose business and customers. and then of course, the consumers loose in the end as well. i prefer to have choice, just as i prefer to use different platforms for different parts of my job, or at home. but if it's one thing i've learned over my life, a lot of people just like to complain, and they need something or someone to take it out on. and they never seem happy unless their bashing something, trying to make themselves feel better than others...but it's none of the people you mentioned. where in mr. bott's article did you find any reference to goats? the only reference to cow, as in cash cow, was in a quote from another article. mr. bott did not promote microsoft. all he did was take readily available data, and do a side-by-side comparison. he even said that the stock market was known to be way off. his point was that the evidence does not support the assumptions - for either ms or apple. microsoft hit with competition complaint over windows 8 uefi secure boot zdnet newsletters get
