RELATED STORIES Philippines' top nickel ore producer sees flat shipments, better prices this year The Philippines is the biggest exporter to top metals consumer China of nickel ore, used to make stainless steel. A smattering of smaller mines are likely to be affected in coming months and new mines will probably face tough going in the future, but the review of the mining sector is not likely to result in a quick drop in shipments. \"The Chinese think the Philippines will continue exporting ore to China and only some small mines will be affected. They're not worried about the situation at the moment,\" said Peter Peng, analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing. The biggest Philippine producer, Nickel Asia Corp., which has already complied with international mining standards, accounted for close to 40% of Philippine nickel ore production last year, according to analyst <mark>David Wilson</mark> at Citi in London. Three other major miners also say they have approvals, while small-scale miners only accounted for about 11% of ore produced last year, he added. \"We therefore suspect that the impact of environmental license suspension may be more limited than initially feared, and believe the recent rally will run out of steam,\" he said in a note. Of the 40 operating mines, 21 have obtained their ISO 14001 certification, said Ronald S. Recidoro, Legal & Policy vice-president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines. POPULAR ANGER Benchmark nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange have rallied a fifth to eight-month highs since June 4 when incoming President Rodrigo R. Duterte warned mining companies to \"shape up\". What remains unknown is how tough the mining minister, Regina Paz \"Gina\" L. Lopez, a committed environmentalist, will be in enforcing environmental and social responsibility rules. Days after she assumed office on June 30, a review of all mines was launched and two small mines were suspended. Analyst Jim Lennon, a consultant for Macquarie, said politicians in the Philippines were responding to public anger at damaging practices in the small-scale mining sector. \"Small miners are stripping away the overgrowth and the forestry and mining down 5-10 meters (yards), but don't bother replacing the overburden and replanting,\" Lennon said. Philippine nickel ore exports to China were already down this year before the crackdown, due to low prices and as some mines ran out of ore. \"Exports are down 25% in the first half anyway, because of the price and reserve exhaustion, so if any of the mines were to be shut down, there's still plenty of capacity,\" Mr. Lennon said. \"So my feeling is that there will be more of an impact on new mines because I think there will be a much more extended environmental approval process .\" The Philippine government has halted permits to develop new mines since 2012 while it works out ways to get more revenue from the sector, but such efforts in Congress have stalled .--Reuters E-mail |"}, {"articleID": "2009103119_00068576_W", "names": {"Eric Walker": ["Q3056424", "Q5387694"]}, "date": "2009-10-31", "url": "http://southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/sport/Coach-Eric-is-just-knockout.5769055.jp", "content": "the plaudits continue to come in for veteran boxing trainer <mark>eric walker</mark> whose 50-plus year career in and out of the ring has led to a string of awards. <mark>walker</mark> - who runs the wombwell and dearne amateur boxing club in bolton-upon-dearne - has now been named coach of the year at the rotherham sports awards in recognition for his successes over the past year. he said: \"i'm over the moon, this is brilliant. this is about the fifth one i've had now, but it's still great to get them .\" two years ago <mark>walker</mark> received a lifetime achievement award at the south yorkshire sport awards in recognition of his half-century career. current young prospect connor nixon is a champion at national level and will again box for england this weekend - a status he initially acquired after just 11 amateur fights out of wombwell and dearne abc. <mark>walker</mark> also runs coaching sessions where he trains pupils who have had problems at school and helps them achieve a qualification. he first picked up the pads in his early thirties, after a stint as an amateur fighting out of mexborough. initially he took up residence at a gym alongside a karate and kick-boxing instructor, until the amateur boxing association ruled that the disciplines should not be practiced together and he was forced to move out on his own. the black bull pub in stairfoot, barnsley, became his stable's new home as he converted the small upstairs room into a gym with home-made equipment and a ring. as the club expanded he moved into wombwell swimming baths before taking over from his friend jack priestley at a declining gym in bolton-on-dearne where he remains, 20 years on. in his time <mark>walker</mark> has produced some of south york-shire's brightest boxing talents out of wombwell and dearne amateur boxing club through various special techniques and approaches. the brookes brothers - stuart and the late scott - both started their boxing careers with <mark>walker</mark> while successful amateur tommy coward remains in his stable."}, {"articleID": "2014102403_00004096_W", "names": {"John Carr": ["Q37372878", "Q37731921", "Q47546431", "Q55938805", "Q6225265", "Q7307535"]}, "date": "2014-10-24", "url": "http://www.stanforddaily.com/2014/10/23/anita-speaking-truth-to-power-screened-at-title-ix-conference/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=anita-speaking-truth-to-power-screened-at-title-ix-conference", "content": "A Tale of Two Transfers Dylan Fugel dives into the to divergent paths of the past two Stanford quarterback transfers, Brett Nottingham and David Olson Back and forth with OSU Daily Barometer With the Oregon State game rapidly approaching, the Daily's Winston Shi talked about the matchup with the OSU Daily Barometer sports editor TeJo Pack Our talented staff of editors, writers and photographers form the hub of Stanford-related news, the voice of the student body and a window into the Farm for a broad print and digital audience. Scene from \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power .\" Courtesy of American Film Foundation. Like many political events of the past few decades, Anita Hill's 1991 testimony before the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary can be recognized from a few token soundbites. Hill, then an attorney-advisor to Clarence Thomas, accused Thomas of sexual harassment preceding confirmation hearings for his nomination as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Hill passed a polygraph test; Thomas declined, calling it a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks .\" According to the film \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power,\" this phrase is a grossly misleading caricature of a difficult case. The original hearing was televised on October 12. As a nod, it seems, both to the anniversary of Hill's hearing and the recent controversy surrounding Title IX rights on campus, Stanford University sponsored a two-day conference from October 16 to 17 with Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University. The conference featured a new documentary and workshops on Hill's hearing and sexual harassment in the workplace. \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power\" was screened on October 16 at Paul Brest Hall, with a Q & A with Professor Hill afterwards. Director Freida Mock's documentary is a compilation of interviews with Hill and her colleagues and footage from the original hearing. Throughout the film, the audience is granted glimpses of a woman who remained remarkably poised while under attack from members of Congress. In the course of the film's commentary, Hill's friends point out the imbalance of demographics at the trial's outset. The Senate Judiciary Committee was homogeneously white and male (a much younger Joe Biden presided over the proceedings). Gender and race were hot-button topics that received only a cursory evaluation - the film commits a number of blundering inquiries to memory. In an interview, <mark>John Carr</mark>, a friend of Hill's, underscored the invisible consequences of the trial. \"She paid the price,\" said <mark>Carr</mark>. \"She could've been a judicial nominee .\" The film highlighted the committee's bouts of targeted questioning, most of which required that Hill reiterate embarrassing details of her encounters with Thomas, seemed designed to make her sound absurd. Hill's quiet resilience provided a foil for Thomas's fiery rebuttals. \"I think that this today is a travesty,\" said Thomas during his testimony, in reference to the hearing in whole. He proceeded to categorically reject every accusation against him - the phrase \"high-tech lynching\" was used during this opening salvo. \"He played the race card,\" said <mark>Carr</mark> of Thomas's phrasing. The focus of the trial promptly turned away from sexual harassment and towards race. For this reason, perhaps, Thomas was cleared for his hearing and confirmed as a justice by a vote of 52-48, the narrowest margin to date. Hill returned to her teaching position at the University of Oklahoma soon after the trial. Today, Hill speaks on sexual harassment, using her experiences as a vehicle. She engaged the audience in a Q & A session following the film screening. One female audience member expressed her shock at the blatant rudeness of committee members' questions: \"Has anyone apologized?\" Hill's response was at once illuminating, disappointing, and inspiring. \"No, no apologies,\" she said. \"[In] Washington, apologies are easy - they don't mean anything. What I want is action .\" She described her faith in the younger generation of female leaders and politicians, young women who could use her experience to move forward.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up <mark>Trump</mark>'s pivot on Jerusalem triggered warnings from America's friends and foes alike that he is needlessly stirring more conflict in an already volatile region. The religious and political dispute over Jerusalem forms the emotional core of the Israeli-Arab conflict. The ancient city is home to major Jewish, Muslim and Christian shrines and looms large in the competing national narratives of Israelis and Palestinians. In a Wednesday address from the White House, <mark>Trump</mark> defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated failures to achieve peace a new approach was long overdue, describing his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government as merely based on reality. The move was hailed by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and by leaders across much of the Israeli political spectrum. <mark>Trump</mark> stressed that he was not specifying the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the city, and called for no change in the status quo at the city's holy sites. <mark>Trump</mark>'s decision on Jerusalem is widely seen in the region as a blatant expression of pro-Israel bias, but it was unclear if protests and confrontations would maintain momentum after Friday.

(AP Photo/Bilal Hussein) Across the region--from Asia's Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan to North Africa's Algeria and Lebanon in the Levant--thousands of worshipers poured into the streets after midday prayers to voice their anger. Some protesters burned US and Israeli flags or stomped <mark>Trump</mark> posters that showed the president alongside a Nazi swastika. In Jordan's capital of Amman, thousands marched through the center of town, chanting \"America is the head of the snake .\" Pro-Western Jordan is a crucial US. ally in the fight against Islamic extremists, but King Abdullah II cannot afford to be seen as soft on Jerusalem. His Hashemite dynasty derives its legitimacy from its role as guardian of the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam's third-holiest site, that sits on the Temple Mount. <mark>Trump</mark>'s decision has also strained US foreign relations UN Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov told an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Friday that <mark>Trump</mark>'s announcement created a \"serious risk\" of a chain of unilateral actions that would push the goal of peace further away. Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour warned of the danger of \"a never-ending religious war that will only be exploited by extremists, fueling more radicalism, violence and strife in the region and elsewhere .\" Even traditional US allies sharply criticized <mark>Trump</mark>'s decision. Sweden's UN Ambassador Olof Skoog said the US action \"contradicts international law and Security Council resolutions .\" Britain's Ambassador Matthew Rycroft called the US decision \"unhelpful to peace,\" the French envoy expressed regret and Italy's Sebastiano Cardi warned of \"the risk of unrest and tensions in the region .\" The US ambassador, Nikki Haley, told the council that the <mark>Trump</mark> administration is more committed to peace \"than we've ever been before--and we believe we might be closer to that goal than ever before .\" Haley did not explain.

Tillerson said it will likely take years for the US to open an embassy in Jerusalem. In a news conference with the French foreign minister, Tillerson said <mark>Trump</mark>'s recognition of the city as Israel's capital \"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem .\" The United States is making clear that Jerusalem's borders will be left to Israelis and Palestinians to \"negotiate and decide,\" he said. Most countries around the world have not recognized Israel's 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Under a longstanding international consensus, the fate of the city is to be determined in negotiations. <mark>Trump</mark>'s announcement delivered a blow to <mark>Abbas</mark>, a supporter of the idea of reaching Palestinian statehood through US-led negotiations with Israel. In siding with Israel on Jerusalem, he has said, the <mark>Trump</mark> administration effectively disqualified itself as a mediator. However, Palestinian Authority President <mark>Mahmoud Abbas</mark> has not decided how to move forward, including whether he will rule out future US-brokered negotiations. <mark>Trump</mark> has said he still intends to propose a Mideast peace deal. More than two decades of intermittent Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to statehood. Some in <mark>Abbas</mark>' inner circle say the old paradigm, with the US serving as mediator, is no longer relevant. On Thursday, a senior Fatah official said the Palestinians would not receive Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the West Bank later this month, but it was not immediately clear if the official spoke for <mark>Abbas</mark>. The Arab League, an umbrella group of close to two dozen states, is to meet Saturday to try to forge a joint position, followed next week by a gathering in Turkey of the 57-state Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

Both the House and Senate voted decisively to reverse Obama's decision to scuttle the legislation. Democrats in both chambers abandoned the president in large numbers despite warnings from Obama and top national security officials that flaws in the bill could put US interests, troops, and intelligence personnel at risk. Advertisement The Senate vote was 97-1. The House vote a few hours later was 348-77. Lawmakers said their priority was the 9/11 victims and their families, not Saudi Arabia. \"The White House and the executive branch (are) far more interested in diplomatic considerations,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and a sponsor of the bill. \"We're more interested in the families and in justice .\" Speaking at a forum in Washington, CIA Director <mark>John Brennan</mark> said he was concerned about how Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, would interpret the bill. He said the Saudis provide significant amounts of information to the United States to help foil extremist plots. \"It would an absolute shame if this legislation, in any way, influenced the Saudi willingness to continue to be among our best counterterrorism partners,\" <mark>Brennan</mark> said. Advertisement <mark>Brennan</mark>, who said he visited lawmakers Wednesday to argue against an override of Obama's veto, noted that there is a tremendous amount of Saudi investment in the United States. \"Do they want to leave them here so they could potentially be attached by some type of court ruling that is going to award the litigants?\" he asked. After senators acted, White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the vote the \"single most embarrassing thing\" the Senate has done in decades and \"an abdication\" of its responsibility. He accused members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of not understanding the legislation and its impact on the military. Five weeks before state and national elections, lawmakers refused to oppose a measure strongly supported by 9/11 families who say they are still seeking justice 15 years after attackers killed nearly 3,000 people. Saudi Arabia is staunchly opposed to the measure. Despite reversing Obama's decision, a group of senators acknowledged that defects in the bill could open a legal Pandora's box, triggering lawsuits from people in other countries seeking redress for injuries or deaths caused by military actions in which the United States may have had a role. In a letter sent Tuesday to Senate minority leader <mark>Harry Reid</mark>, Obama said the bill would erode sovereign immunity principles that prevent foreign litigants \"from second-guessing our counterterrorism operations and other actions that we take every day .\" <mark>Reid</mark> was the lone senator to side with the president. But proponents of the bill dismissed Obama's concerns as unpersuasive. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on US soil. \"This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,\" Cornyn said. Families of the victims and their attorneys dismissed concerns over the legislation as fear-mongering. Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, one of the Democrats who broke with Obama and voted to override, said, \"The risks of shielding the perpetrators of terrorism from justice are greater than the risks this legislation may pose to America's presence around the world .\" The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in US court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis. Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurred inside US borders, according to the terms of the bill. A group of national-security minded legislators pledged to discuss how to repair problem areas during the upcoming lame-duck session of Congress. But the fact that legislation could pass both chambers of Congress without closer scrutiny left at least a few senators chiding themselves for not examining its ramifications more closely. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act moved to the floor of the Senate in May and was passed by voice vote. The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote. \"We didn't pay much attention to this,\" said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"And boy is that ever a lesson learned .\" Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the country vulnerable to retaliatory litigation. In his letter to <mark>Reid</mark>, the president said other countries could attempt to use law to justify similar immunity exceptions to target US policies and activities that they oppose. In a separate letter sent Monday to a senior House member, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter described the potential for foreign litigants to seek classified intelligence data and analysis and sensitive operational information to establish their cases in what could be an \"intrusive discovery process .\" Missing the vote were Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Of the Massachusetts delegation, both Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and Representatives Michael Capuano, <mark>Katherine Clark</mark>, <mark>Joseph Kennedy</mark> III, William Keating, <mark>Stephen Lynch</mark>, <mark>Richard Neal</mark>, and Niki Tsongas backed the override of Obama's veto.

Communicating with the business now more than ever requires communicating with these users, and effective communication requires a clear understanding of their experience with the application services you deliver. But how well do you understand end-user experience? To answer that question, let's first define end-user experience as the transaction response time a user receives from an application service; click to glass seems to be the term in vogue. Alternatively, you can look at the question from a different perspective: How is the quality of your application services measured? Are you driven primarily by infrastructure and application performance metrics, or by end-user experience? Whether your data center supports customer-facing applications that directly generate revenue or enterprise applications that automate and manage critical business processes - or, increasingly, both - application performance matters. It is the way your service quality is perceived by your users - consumers or employees. Business owners understand this intrinsically; poor ecommerce site performance results in lost revenue and damaged loyalty, while internally, poor application performance leads to decreased productivity and lost business opportunities. APM's Three Aspects Application performance monitoring can be segmented into three aspects, or disciplines: Device monitoring provides critical visibility into the health of the infrastructure components - the servers, disks, switches, routers, firewalls, desktops, etc. required to deliver application services. Application monitoring provides visibility into critical application components, such as application containers, methods, databases, APIs, etc.. End-user experience monitoring, within its performance context, provides visibility into user productivity, and provides a top-down business-centric perspective of both device and application performance. It's clear that the first two aspects - device and application monitoring - are fundamentally important. We should also be able to agree that, to answer our earlier question about service quality, you must also measure the end-user's experience. When users complain, they speak in terms of transaction speed, not network latency, interface utilization, database queries, java server pages, or CPU speed. (Well, if you're on the network team, you'll claim they often will say the network is slow, but we generally know better .) The user's experience can be considered the intersection between business metrics (productivity) and IT metrics (device and application); it's the one metric both groups have in common. Most of us are pretty good at device and application monitoring; this is often not the case when we consider end-user experience monitoring. So what are the penalties if you're not measuring end-user experience?' You won't know users are having a problem until they call you (unless something catastrophic happens). You will chase after problems that don't affect users (because you're monitoring dozens, or hundreds, of metrics of varying impact). You won't have a description of the problem that matches your metrics (and therefore don't have a validated starting point for troubleshooting). You won't know when or if you've resolved the problem (without asking the users). At Cisco Live this week, an IT manager told me of his frustration with all-too-frequent 3 a.m. infrastructure or application alerts: should he get up and investigate? He had no idea if the problem of the moment had any impact on users. Only by adopting end-user experience monitoring was he able to qualify and prioritize his response. Don't We Already Measure End-User Experience? It's true that many applications - particularly those based on Java and. NET platforms - may already be instrumented with APM agents, some of which provide exactly this insight into end-user experience. However: These APM solutions are often not used by operations teams Not all Java and. NET apps will be instrumented (and if you're not using Dynatrace, you might only be sampling transactions) Many application architectures don't lend themselves to agent-based instrumentation IT operations teams therefore usually rely on more traditional infrastructure-centric device and network monitoring solutions. The rise of application-awareness (primarily in Application Aware Network Performance Monitoring - AA NPM - solutions, but also in device management offerings) has given IT varying degrees of insight into application behavior - and sometimes a degree of insight into application performance. However, without visibility into end-user experience, without a user transaction-centric starting point, these tools do little to foster the communication and collaboration we mentioned earlier. As I pointed out in a recent webcast called the Top Five Benefits of Transaction-Centric NPM, AA NPM solutions are generally quite limited in their ability to measure actual end-user experience, especially across a broad range of application architectures. Instead, these tools use key infrastructure measurements such as network latency, packet loss, jitter, etc., as indicators or hints of application performance as experienced by end users. These metrics may be quite meaningful to IT specialists, but they aren't end-user experience and don't provide a basis for effective communication.

What is all this going to mean for performance testing? It's almost impossible to know for sure as so much of this story remains unwritten. However, there are industries where IoT is already happening. Let's take a look at a few of these and ponder the future of performance testing for IoT applications. iPhone Developer's Journal provides updates on related technology advances, software and business trends, and new products and standards relating to the iPhone.

Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps Join Us at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, California, November 3-5 Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS - software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service. Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year. Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous. Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud. Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: \u2022 Cloud Computing \u2022 Big Data | Analytics \u2022 Internet of Things \u2022 Containers | Microservices \u2022 WebRTC \u2022 DevOps Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100 + exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. Save $300 on your \"Golden Pass\" !

Mariota completed 16-of-27 passes for 355 yards and also rushed for a pair of scores for the Ducks (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12), who have won each game this season by at least 39 points. Bralon Addison caught five passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Huff finished with five catches for 103 yards and two scores and Byron Marshall picked up 122 yards on the ground in the win. \"I didn't really think about mercy,\" Oregon head coach <mark>Mark Helfrich</mark> said. \"That's a good program, a proud program. We're not in the embarrassment business. We're not in the statistic business and we don't think about individual awards. That's not our deal. We just wanted to get in a rhythm offensively .\" Connor Wood was 11-for-33 passing for 205 yards and two interceptions. <mark>Paul Richardson</mark> finished with 134 yards receiving and also threw a 75-yard touchdown pass for the Buffaloes (2-2, 0-2), who have dropped back-to-back games. Colorado jumped out to an early lead as Will Oliver booted through a 33-yard field goal. The Ducks, though, answered back just over two minutes later as Mariota ran it in from two yards out. Pharaoh Brown bulled his way across the goal line for the two-point conversion to make it 8-3. The Buffs got creative on their next touch as <mark>Richardson</mark> took a pitch on a reverse then found D.D. Goodson wide open along the right sideline for a 75 - yard touchdown. Oregon, however, added three touchdowns before the end of the first quarter to blow the game wide open. First, Thomas Tyner ran it in from two yards out, and Mariota followed with a 75-yard touchdown strike to Addison. After Wood was picked off by Terrance Mitchell on the Colorado 26, Mariota connected with Keanon Lower for a 17-yard score to make it 29-10. Oliver added a pair of field goals early in the second, but Mariota tacked on two more touchdowns to close out the half. \"I felt like if we would've kept coming away with nothing, I felt it might have deflated us,\" MacIntyre said. \"I felt the field goals us a little bit of energy .\" The sensational sophomore capped a 12-play, 67-yard drive with a 1-yard TD plunge before orchestrating an 11-play, 92-yard march which ended in a 4-yard toss to Huff for a 43-16 lead heading into the break. Mariota found Addison for a 44-yard touchdown 4:21 into the second half for a 50-16 cushion before adding a 26-yard TD strike to Huff just under four minutes later .> Apps and services for tablet devices> Apps and services for your mobile phone> Get updates via Facebook and Twitter> Your daily paper delivered to your computer Also check out our community publications"}]
