The chief philosophical influence of an American neo-Nazi extremist group that is the subject of a nationwide FBI crackdown and is believed to be on the cusp of being declared a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department, is claiming in an audio message obtained by Motherboard that the group is disbanding. In the recording, <mark>James Mason</mark>, a longtime figure within the U.S. neo-Nazi movement and the author of what's considered an important work in the racist canon of the far-right, claims to officially announce the demise of Atomwaffen Division, a group that has become synonymous in recent years with white nationalist terrorism and is linked to five murders. \"This is a press announcement from <mark>James Mason</mark> on the evening of March 9 of this year,\" said <mark>Mason</mark>, who is known to be an advisor to the group and has made personal appearances in some of its propaganda videos. \"I was approached by members of the group known as Atomwaffen Division with the request that I make the official announcement of that group's disbanding, effective at once .\" Motherboard spoke to sources familiar with <mark>Mason</mark>'s voice who believe it to be him on the recording, which is already circulating online. While the statement does not necessarily prove the group or its supporters are abandoning their activities, it does show the sustained pressure by federal authorities is having a negative effect on the militant neo-Nazi movement. In late February, the FBI arrested five members of the group, including its former leader <mark>John Cameron</mark> Denton, 26, who goes by the online alias \"Rape,\" for allegedly swatting journalists and members of the Trump Administration. A month earlier the FBI announced the arrest of six members of The Base, another neo-Nazi terror group linked to Atomwaffen Division, on charges of planning assassinations and mass shootings. Federal prosectors in Virginia where Denton is being tried recently alleged in court the former leader shared child pornography with another unnamed individual. In 1992, <mark>Mason</mark>, known for his writings advocating for a white ethnostate, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of possessing child pornography. <mark>Mason</mark> made it clear in the latest recording that the notice of disbanding comes on the heels of FBI pressure on the group. \"Over the course of past weeks and months, the level and degree of federal infiltration and the numerous arrests stemming from that have so severely hampered the group's ability to function as a group that it would be pointless to even pretend that anything resembling organizational activity could continue,\" he said. <mark>Mason</mark> went on to declare, \"anything found on the internet henceforth claiming to be or bearing the mark of Atomwaffen Division\" was to be considered an impostor. Last fall, a group claiming to be Atomwaffen Division released a widely circulated propaganda video, which was swiftly denounced by <mark>Mason</mark> as a fraud.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was \"very difficult\" for people to get out of those countries. He told the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee: \"The challenge there is to make sure, first of all, the governments of those countries keep a route so British nationals can get out .\" Mr Raab said there were between 300,000 and \"closer to a million\" British nationals travelling abroad. \"That is a massive, massive scale,\" he admitted.

Tourists in Morocco face a race against time to get home as the country is closing its airspace after Thursday. Bob Warburton, 62, from Manchester, told the PA news agency that the situation at Agadir airport was \"chaos\" , with hundreds of UK holidaymakers waiting for flights. He explained that he and his wife were unable to contact Ryanair, who they were booked to fly back with, and described the airline as \"appalling and negligent\".

Michael Mancuso | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By <mark>Brent Johnson</mark> | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com and Matt Arco | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com New Jersey will go into virtual lockdown mode starting Saturday night after Gov. <mark>Phil Murphy</mark> announced he is ordering all people to stay at home except for necessary travel and mandating that all non-essential retail businesses in the state close help to battle the spread of the coronavirus. Here's a look at what that means: SO I HAVE TO STAY IN MY HOME? People are limited to traveling for only essential needs, like groceries, food, or medicine, or if they are have to get to a job at a business that is still open. People can also go outside for walks or exercise. Except for the essential workers, the governor wants everyone off the roads, and specifically urged people not to go to the Jersey Shore If they have part-time residences there. \"We expect people to stay home,\" <mark>Murphy</mark> said during a news briefing Saturday at Rutgers-Newark. \"We want you off the roads. That's now 24 hours. We don't want you out there. Period .\" WHAT'S CLOSED? <mark>Murphy</mark> had already indefinitely shuttered a number of businesses amid the outbreak, including indoor malls, movie theaters, casinos, gyms, amusement parks, barber shops, salons, libraries and more. He also limited restaurants to takeout and delivery. Now it extends to the vast majority of retail businesses. WHAT CAN STAY OPEN? Retail businesses allowed to remain open include grocery stores, food banks, pharmacies, medical marijuana dispensaries, gas stations, auto mechanics and repair services, convenience stores, banks, hardware and home improvement stores, laundromats, dry cleaners, printing and office supply shops, pet stores, stores that sell supplies for young children, and mail and delivering shops. Restaurants, bars and liquor stores that provide takeout and delivery can also stay open. Manufacturing, industrial, logistics, ports, heavy construction, shipping, food production, food delivery, and other commercial operations may continue operating, but they must keep staff at a minimal level on site to make sure \"essential operations can continue .\" Medical facilities can continue to operate. Child day care centers will also remain open. <mark>Murphy</mark> has said many emergency and essential workers need a place to watch their children. Other businesses should allow people to work from home, if possible, the governor said. MORE: What is an essential retail business in N.J.? A list of places that can stay open in coronavirus shutdown. WHAT ABOUT PUBLIC GATHERINGS? <mark>Murphy</mark> has barred any public gatherings--parties, funerals, concerts, etc.. He first limited them to 250 people and then reduced it to 50 people. Now all are barred. \"This decision is not an easy one, and it pains me that important life moments will not be celebrated the way we are accustomed to,\" <mark>Murphy</mark> said. \"Our singular goal is to make sure we get through this emergency so you can safely gather with family and friends later and enjoy many more wedding and birthdays to come .\" WHO IS CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL WORKER? Health-care and medical-services workers, members of the media, law enforcement agencies, federal government workers, those who work at businesses that are allowed to remain open. WHEN DOES THIS GO INTO EFFECT? 9 p.m. Saturday. HOW LONG WILL IT LAST? That's unclear. <mark>Murphy</mark> said he expects the crisis will be \"measured in weeks to months. This is not next week .\" WHAT IF I DON'T COMPLY? <mark>Murphy</mark> didn't provide specifics on what the penalties would be, but he said: \"If folks are monkeying around, we will take action .\" He has also said any businesses that don't comply will be prosecuted for a disorderly person's offense at the local level. WHY TAKE THIS ACTION? Officials say the more people keep their distance from each other--otherwise known as \"social distancing\" --it will help slow the spread of the virus, which causes the illness COVID-19. \"Social distancing is the key to stopping this,\" state Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. \"There's nothing more sophisticated about it. We don't have a vaccine .\" An NJ Advance Media analysis of data from a Rutgers University study shows in a worst-case scenario, with the minimal amount of social distancing, 1 in 7 people could contract the virus. HOW MUCH HAS THE VIRUS ALREADY SPREAD? The coronavirus is a pandemic that has infected and killed thousands across the globe. In New Jersey, officials have confirmed at least 1,327 known cases, with 16 confirmed deaths. Officials say they expect that number to increase significantly in the coming days as testing expands and there is more evidence of \"community spread .\" The state has not released how many negative tests have come back or how many people have recovered from the virus.
