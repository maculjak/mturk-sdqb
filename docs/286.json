The 23-year-old e-commerce worker spares little expense to make his pooch happy. Pet dog Duoduo walks into Cute Beast Pet Resort in Beijing, China December 22, 2017. Picture taken December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Lee \"I'll happily splash out on my dog,\" Li told Reuters as he walked his brown poodle Coco in Pingyang, a town on China's east coast. \"She is like a child to me .\" He is far from alone in China these days. The growth in the middle class, a massive move to urbanization and other demographic changes - such as growing numbers of elderly, and people getting married and having children later than before - have been turning this into not just a pet-owning society but also one that is prepared to lavish money on them. Chinese shoppers are set to spend 46.3 billion yuan ($7 billion) on their pets by 2022, up from 17.5 billion yuan this year as the market grows at around an annual 20 percent, according to estimates from Euromonitor. The U.S. market may be much bigger with an estimated $44.4 billion in sales this year but it is only growing around 2 percent a year. The surge in Chinese demand is not only great news for global pet food behemoths such as Mars Inc and Nestle SA NESN. S, but also rapidly growing Chinese pet food and product companies, as well as entrepreneurs setting up everything from dog salons for grooming to fancy pet hotels. It is an amazing shift in a country where owning pets was once banned for being too much of a bourgeois pursuit under revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and where - despite protests - there is still an annual dog-meat festival in the southern Chinese town of Yulin. \"There is huge growth potential in the Chinese market,\" said Liu Yonghao, the chairman of Chinese company New Hope Group [NWHOP. UL] at a recent event in Beijing, noting that younger people especially were developing closer bonds with their pets. \"They are willing to spend lots of money on the pets because they have become like part of the family,\" he said. New Hope joined a consortium, including Singapore's state-owned fund Temasek and private equity firm Hosen Capital that just closed a $1 billion deal to acquire Australian pet food maker Real Pet Food Co, with the aim of bringing the firm's brands to China. The growing popularity of pets is turning China into a magnet for local and global firms. Thomas Kwan, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based fund manager Harvest Global, said China's pet market would be one of his personal picks for 2018 as consumers looked to shift up to premium products. The questions pet owners are asking now: \"Can you buy them healthy foods? Can you give them a good lifestyle?\" he said. BONE-SHAPED CENTER Pingyang, where Li lives with his poodle, has big ambitions in China's pet economy. The county, which is near the wealthy city of Wenzhou and has a population of almost one million, is among a slew of places responding to Beijing's call to create 1,000 \"specialty towns\" by 2020 in industries from cloud computing to chocolate. In Pingyang's case the theme is pets. It has a dog bone-shaped visitor center and pet factories, while locals said there were plans for pet-themed hotels and a retail hub. On a recent visit, though, it was clear the concept has a way to go. The visitor center was shut and locals admitted the \"pet town' had yet to fully catch on. Nationally though, there is no doubt that the pet economy is thriving--helped by demographic shifts .\" Chinese society is aging, we're experiencing declining birth rates, we have empty nesters and the youngsters from those empty nests, \"said <mark>Zhang</mark> Tianli, co-founder of Hosen Capital, adding pets were helping people find\" spiritual sustenance \". The pet products boom has stoked imports and boosted local business. Among the Chinese companies that are now challenging the global giants, in China at least, are Shanghai Bridge Petcare, Sunsun Group and Navarch. Yantai China Pet Foods 002891. SZ has seen its stock climb close to 60 percent since it listed in Shenzhen in August. Smaller entrepreneurs abound too. They include DogWhere.com, which offers pet holidays and runs a boutique pet hotel in Beijing with all sorts of amenities for the pets - including a swimming pool, pet-sized bedrooms and a cinema. Owners can spend thousands of dollars per stay .\" We once looked after a dog in our hotel for 47 nights, at a total costs of 17,000 yuan ($2,585), \"said the platform's marketing manager <mark>Wang Chao</mark>. Xiao Xudong in Beijing runs a popular grooming service for\" Westies \"- West Highland White Terriers - and says his increasingly youthful clientele fly in from regions as remote as far-western Xinjiang and the southwestern Yunnan province .\" Young people hold a different consumption view to the older generations, \"said Xiao, 45 .\" They think a lot about how their pets are groomed and are willing to splash out on them. \"PET BATHING Despite the growth, Chinese pet ownership is still just getting started. Some pets are mistreated and there is a lack of know-how about vaccinations and sterilization. Strict rules about pet food imports also stoke a gray market trade. Earlier this month, police arrested gang members who were selling poisoned darts used to kill dogs that were then sold to restaurants, the official Xinhua news reported, opening the debate once more about the practice of eating dog meat. Back in Pingyang's state-sanctioned pet town, the owner of one pet shop said the shift towards pet ownership was nonetheless stark .\" Ten years ago this place was basically farmland and people were eating dogs, now they don't eat them as much and have started to see them as pets, \"he said. In the shop, <mark>Wang Jing</mark>, 26, was getting her two dogs - Can Can and Niu Niu - their regular bath. She said she spent around 2,000 yuan a month on them, mostly on food, but that it was all worth it when she arrived home each day .\" Otherwise when you come back there's nobody there, \"she said .\" But if you have a dog then it jumps on you happily as soon as you open the door. \"Reporting by Anita Li in PINGYANG, Hallie Gu in BEIJING and Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by SHANGHAI newsroom, Lusha <mark>Zhang</mark> and <mark>Shu Zhang</mark> in BEIJING; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Edited by Martin Howell 0: 0"}, {"articleID": "2017122121_00165968_W", "names": {"John Kelly": ["Q1529538", "Q16121409", "Q16190651", "Q19950171", "Q20679793", "Q21543413", "Q23008537", "Q27915220", "Q27915222", "Q3181857", "Q42290073", "Q43132411", "Q45190351", "Q56597784", "Q6232322", "Q6242695", "Q6242701", "Q6242710", "Q6242715", "Q6242718", "Q6242722", "Q6242726", "Q6242728", "Q6242740"]}, "date": "2017-12-21", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/us/donald-trump-walter-reed-visit-soldiers/2017/12/21/id/833201/", "content": "Trump Swings by Walter Reed to Visit With Soldiers (Andrew Harrer/Getty Images) By Jason Devaney | Thursday, 21 Dec 2017 04:03 PM Close A A President Donald Trump visited soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Thursday afternoon via a short helicopter flight on Marine One.

Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan said it does not behove the prime minister to make such remarks to impressionable minds while addressing the NCC rally on Tuesday here. The Congress leader also raised questions over the credibility of the poll panel. \"We have got serious questions about the impartiality of the Election Commission,\" Chavan told reporters. On two BJP leaders who have been removed by the Election Commission from the list of star campaigners, he said, whatever BJP does, it is for the poll panel to take it up with the BJP leadership but we would like to raise the issue of Prime Minister's speech at the NCC rally. \"Election (campaign) is going on in Delhi and the prime minister's speech in the NCC rally, particularly to the young minds, I deplore that wholly and I request the Election Commission to take it up seriously .\" Just because he is the prime minister, he should not violate the rules. He cannot violate the guidelines of the Election Commission, \"he said. Chavan also welcomed the EC order against two BJP leaders, but remained critical of the prime minister's remarks at the NCC rally .\" Whatever the prime minister has said violated the model code. Whatever the PM has said to the young impressionable minds, I feel it does not behove the prime minister to say such things, \"he said. Addressing the Annual Prime Minister's National Cadet Corps (NCC) Rally 2020, Modi had on Tuesday said his government brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to correct\" historical \"injustices and recalled the Nehru-Liaquat pact to assert that the law fulfils India's\" old promise \"to religious minorities in neighbouring countries. Modi had also said the Jammu and Kashmir problem had persisted since Independence with some families and political parties keeping issues in the region alive. This had resulted in terrorism thriving, he had said. He had also slammed Pakistan and said it lost three wars but continues to wage proxy wars against India.

Alfred Taubman. Sotheby's fought hard to win the consignment--guaranteeing the estate for a little over $500 million--and it heavily marketed the sale, the first of four to feature his holdings, as a memorial to Mr. Taubman's artistic taste. But spotty bidding and a few unsold pieces damped the mood in Sotheby's York Avenue saleroom, turning the night into a dogged jog more than a victory lap. The sale eked past the low bar of Sotheby's $375 million and $537 million expectations, but its total includes its fees, unlike its presale estimates. It remains to be seen whether the house will break even on its deal with Mr. Taubman's heirs, but Chief Executive Tad Smith said, \"We remain on track to cover most of the total guarantee .\" The star of the sale was \"Paulette Jourdain,\" Amedeo Modigliani's demure portrait of his dealer's housemaid and girlfriend, which sold to an Asian telephone bidder for $42.8 million, well over its $25 million estimate. Before the sale, dealer <mark>Helly Nahmad</mark> said the 1919 portrait looked like a bargain compared with some of the Italian modernist's other portraits that have sold for as much as $69 million. (Rival Christie's plans to ask $100 million for a Modigliani nude next Monday .) Sotheby's also sold a chartreuse-and-cherry-colored abstract by Willem de Kooning for $25 million, its low estimate. Mr. Taubman bought the work from a gallery a year after the artist painted it in 1976. Sotheby's also reset the auction high bar for Frank Stella when it sold his red geometric abstract, \"Delaware Crossing,\" for $13.7 million, over its $12 million high estimate. But a gray-black <mark>Jasper Johns</mark> abstract, \"Disappearance I,\" estimated to sell for $15 million didn't garner any bids, and no one wanted Edgar Degas's sensuous portrait of a nude woman brushing her red hair after taking a bath, \"Nude Woman, Back .\" It also carried $15 million estimate. Elsewhere in the sale, a pair of Mark Rothko abstracts met with so-so results: \"No. 6/Sienna, Orange on Wine\" selling for $17.6 million and \"Untitled (Lavender and Green)\" selling for $20.4 million. Both were estimated to sell for at least $20 million. What does Mr. Taubman's sale portend for the art market overall? Collectors and dealers will likely wait to see how Sotheby's fares Thursday with its impressionist and modern art sale before making any lasting rulings."}, {"articleID": "2012012017_00096489_W", "names": {"Phil Wilson": ["Q16734486", "Q2085745", "Q262201", "Q7182561", "Q7182562", "Q7182564", "Q7182565"], "Anthony King": ["Q20749328", "Q3618504", "Q4772882", "Q4772883", "Q4772884", "Q55099172"], "Jim Moore": ["Q16732815", "Q17378085", "Q22006996", "Q28444878"], "Richard Thomas": ["Q15431585", "Q15993570", "Q203314", "Q2150753", "Q22111480", "Q3431268", "Q492238", "Q51880914", "Q56598144", "Q56600036", "Q57895976", "Q7329442", "Q7329446"], "Charlie Phillips": ["Q19979363", "Q39073772", "Q5085394", "Q5085397", "Q55042162"]}, "date": "2012-01-20", "url": "http://odt.co.nz/your-town/queenstown/195071/chamber-members-warned", "content": "queenstown chamber of commerce president alastair porter has warned members they have little cause to expect an improvement in business this year. the property developer told the 68 members who attended the annual meeting at the skycity queenstown casino \"the one certainty in the world today is uncertainty\". \"it is enormously difficult to predict the future and while 2010 and 2011 have been difficult years for many businesses, there is little reason to expect 2012 to be a return to better times .\" in fact there are many reasons particularly from a resort perspective to be cautious and concerned. \"mr porter said he would have served as president for more than four years if re-elected this year. he indicated 2012 would be his final term as president if he was re-elected .\" strong organisations are those that keep introducing new leadership and i will accordingly encourage the chamber to find a new president beyond the 2012 [annual meeting], \"he said. mr porter said at the meeting last month that, as president, he placed strong emphasis on the chamber's core values. his view was those core values had never been more important .\" they are for queenstown chamber of commerce to be a catalyst for discussing business issues including bringing key speakers to queenstown, to be proactive in promoting members' interests, being innovative in terms of ways it can assist the economic development of queenstown and co-operating with other key organisations in the district and beyond. \"the chamber was represented last year in forums and meetings regarding parking and transportation, central business district security, labour market and immigration, the sustainable tourism advisers group, sister city committee, the rugby world cup working group and international tourism trade show trenz. special thanks were given to board members miles <mark>wilson</mark>, past-president, tourism industry identity and canterbury franchisee for queenstown, who completed his tenure, and <mark>anthony king</mark>, lawyer, accountant and new world wakatipu general manager, who stepped down due to new family commitments. board members for 2012 include mr porter as president, event director julie hughes, hotel general manager <mark>jim moore</mark>, publisher <mark>richard thomas</mark>, pharmacist kim wilkinson and lawyer <mark>phil wilson</mark>. of the four members who put their names forward, queenstown resort college chief executive <mark>charlie phillips</mark> was elected to the voluntary board. the board retained the constitutional option of co-opting a further three members. annual accounts find a\" relatively small loss in 2011 \", due to increased chamber activities. increasing subscriptions and more profitable activities in 2011-12 were expected to restore the chamber to profit in this financial year. chief executive ann lockhart told the meeting the chamber's membership had grown considerably, with 80 new members in the previous financial year. the total stood at 345 .\" it is my intention to further raise the membership to 400 by june 2012, \"ms lockhart said."}]
