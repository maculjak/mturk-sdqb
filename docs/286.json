Data provided to The Associated Press by the NFL ahead of its annual pre-Super Bowl health and safety news conference Thursday shows there were 111 concussions in games during the 2014 regular season, down from 148 in 2013, and 173 in 2012, a 36 percent drop over that three-year span. When preseason games, plus preseason and regular-season practices, are included, the 202 concussions this season declined 12 percent from 2013, and 23 percent from 2012. That's despite no new rules meant to protect players' heads. \"Players are changing the way they're tackling,\" NFL Senior Vice President of Health and Safety Policy <mark>Jeff Miller</mark> said. \"They're changing the way they play the game .\" In all, the concussion rate is down to 0.43 per game, <mark>Miller</mark> said, adding: \"You have to play more than two games to get a concussion in the NFL, by those numbers .\" A total of 59 concussions were caused by helmet-to-helmet or shoulder-to-helmet hits this season, the league's data says, almost exactly half as many as two years ago. \"With all the technological innovations that we've had over the past few years, I'm surprised the numbers keep going down,\" St. Louis Rams team doctor Matthew Matava said. \"Because you'd think, with more vigilance, you'd see more of any sort of condition .\" According to STATS, there were 265 players placed on injured reserve during the regular season in 2014, a 17 percent jump from the 226 the year before. This season, for the first time, NFL injury data was collected by all 32 teams through electronic medical records, allowing for more comprehensive accounting. That system does a better job of capturing all injuries - from a bruise, say, to a broken leg - according to Christina Mack, an epidemiologist at Quintiles, a clinical research organization that works with the league. One change is that less-severe injuries, such as a first-degree sprain, are captured more frequently now, she said. Something worse, such as a concussion or torn knee ligament, is just as likely to have been reported under the old setup. A 15 percent hike in injury reporting from 2013 to 2014 - an increase of about 0.9 per game, on average - is at least in part due to the new system, according to Mack. \"We knew it was going to be up this year, because we transitioned to the electronic medical records,\" Mack said in a telephone interview, echoing <mark>Miller</mark>'s explanation. \"We can't conclude the incidence of injuries is up. We know the reporting of injuries is up .\" In December 2013, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick - whose team plays the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday - said it was \"a matter of record, not opinion\" that injuries league-wide had been on the rise recently. Belichick blamed a decrease in the number of offseason, preseason and in-season practice sessions and workouts allowed as a main contributor to higher injury totals. That reduction in practice time was among changes made in an effort to cut down on head injuries after the NFL's concussion policies were criticized by Congress, and thousands of ex-players sued the league. Other safety measures include rules protecting defenseless receivers and barring hitting with the crown of the helmet; revised return-to-play protocols; independent neurologists on sidelines during games; \"eye in the sky\" monitoring by athletic trainers to make sure in-game injuries aren't overlooked. ___ Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http: //twitter.com/HowardFendrich \"Broad City\" and the City: 10 ways you know you live in Abbi and Ilana's New York Thanks for nothing, Netflix: Depressing new research links TV binging to depression Lil B launches the vegan emoji app you never knew you needed <mark>Stewart</mark> on \"manspreading\" : \"Don't be an a ** hole on the subway\" <mark>Jon Stewart</mark> slams the Koch brothers for putting a price tag on the 2016 election Bieber's teary apology: \"I'm not that person who says' I don't give a f--!'

Here is a rundown <mark>Kraft</mark>'s recent actions: Prior to one of coach Bill Belichick's Super Bowl press conferences, <mark>Kraft</mark> made a surprise appearance and demanded an apology from the NFL if they are unable to prove that the Patriots intentionally deflated the footballs, noting that he is\" disappointed in the way this entire matter has [been] handled. \"<mark>Kraft</mark> was a no-show to Goodell's pre-Super Bowl state-of-the-league address, a move considered unusual for an owner of one of the team's in the Super Bowl, especially one so close to the commissioner ().

As it now stands, all that money - including $360,000 budgeted for this fiscal year - is collected by the city government but paid quarterly to a group known as the Mount Airy Tourism Development Authority (TDA). The TDA governing board then spends at least two-thirds of the funds on advertising and marketing of the area, with about one-third available for infrastructure projects such as a recent effort to convert the Earle Theatre to a digital facility. The TDA uses all the money as it sees fit, but in accordance with state legislation enacted years ago specifically permitting the collection of the occupancy tax here. Shirley Brinkley, a member of the Mount Airy Board of Commissioners - and also the TDA board - believes the city government itself should start getting some of the occupancy tax revenues. She mentioned other towns where occupancy taxes are levied, which collect all the proceeds then delegate money for tourism-related expenditures. \"We give 100 percent, which not a lot of cities do,\" the commissioner said of delegating the money to another entity. A different arrangement should be considered in Mount Airy, according to Brinkley, whose sentiments were echoed by Commissioner Jon Cawley. \"I think it made sense when it was $100,000 (per year), but it has grown,\" Cawley said of the present system that now involves significantly more money. Although the city budget reflects occupancy tax revenues of $360,000 for the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the final figure probably will be higher, city Finance Director Pam Stone said. She said it could total $400,000 - \"which is a good indicator that people are traveling .\" For the first five months of the fiscal year, through November, the revenues were up 10 percent over the same period in 2013. Cawley said he believes local citizens should be benefiting more from those funds. Changing Mount Airy's procedure of occupancy tax collection and dispensing would require special action by the N.C. General Assembly, according to City Attorney <mark>Hugh Campbell</mark>. That's because occupancy tax legislation is specific to each locality, he explained, including how the money is to be distributed and who can remit those funds and how. There was support at the retreat for seeking the required legislative change in Raleigh and Brinkley reiterated that Wednesday. \"Absolutely,\" she said. Brinkley emphasized during the retreat discussion that her desire to change the occupancy tax set-up does not signal any dissatisfaction with those who now administer the proceeds. \"This is not 'cause you're mad at anybody, or trying to create a mess,\" she said. It is simply a matter of the city needing to tap into additional revenue sources to meet several pressing needs, Brinkley said. Also discussed at the retreat was the possibility of an event fee that would be charged when organizations hold fund-raising walks or similar activities that require police and other services. Such a fee was first discussed a couple of years ago, but never materialized. Along with balancing the regular city budget, Mount Airy officials have been asked to fund a new fire truck, add parking at Reeves Community Center, develop a shell building to better attract industry and other projects in the next fiscal year. One target of TDA funding could be the redevelopment of the former Spencer's industrial site in downtown Mount Airy, Brinkley said. This might include funding a conference center that local tourism representatives have said would boost visitation here. Brinkley indicated that her position on the occupancy tax is bound to ruffle feathers - even with the group of which she is a member. \"I'm on the TDA board now,\" she said. \"But I may get kicked off after this .\" ", "articleID": "2015020423_00042892_W", "names": {"Hugh Campbell": ["Q14950666", "Q20676192", "Q21165079", "Q23583443", "Q43913059"]}}]
