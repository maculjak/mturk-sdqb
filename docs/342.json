Some time ago I wrote a post when it originally aired, \"Why Are We Raiders?\" It prompted me to revisit that post and among the comments I found a response from JSNOOP61 that far outshines my original post. It deserves to stand alone. Raider Nation Forever. Ok, I have been a Raiders fan since the late 60s when I was still in my single digits...I went to a black college, Tennessee State Univ in 1978...Interestingly, head coaches and coaching staffs at black colleges loved two teams: the Raiders and Chiefs, because <mark>Al Davis</mark> and Lamar Hunt were color blind. When the NFL had an unwritten policy that a team couldn't have more than 5 or 6 black players on a team, the AFL was different and the Raiders & Chiefs were more different. They had scouts travel the Southeast and East Coast, where most black colleges were located, looking for talent. And that's one of the reasons <mark>Al Davis</mark> got his reputation as a maverick. Even AFL owners tried to come up with an unwritten policy of a limited number of black players, but <mark>Al</mark> bucked the system, along with Lamar Hunt. Not many people can tell you the colleges Gene Upshaw (Texas A & I) and Art Shell (Maryland State) attended. These were obscure colleges back in the day, and their glory days were back in the 60s, but still, they were fairly unknown colleges that were on the Raiders radar & only the Raiders. Before the Bear Bryants & Joe Paternos got smart and got their heads out of their asses, it was guys like <mark>Eddie Robinson</mark> & John Merritt who were supplying black ballplayers to the AFL & NFL. And in many ways, <mark>Al Davis</mark> was the leading opportunist who opens the flood gates for black players. If Walter Payton & Jerry Rice were coming up today, no way they would attend or play for a Jackson State or Mississippi Valley State. No way <mark>Doug Williams</mark> attend a Grambling State. <mark>Al Davis</mark> brought a lot of focus to the black athlete on both the professional & college level. The man was great. His last 10 years or so he wanted to go to the Super Bowl again before he died. I hate the fact those are the years he will be remembered for vs. everything he done for the AFL & NFL. He & Lamar Hunt deserves way more credit than Pete Rozelle & definitely way more than a Roger Goodell. Those guys will forever receive credit, but the true innovators were guys like <mark>Al</mark>, Hunt, Sid Gillman, etc.. Why Am I A Raider? Because of the great innovator, the man who believed in giving others opportunities that other owners wouldn't--<mark>Al Davis</mark>. And I hate the fact that <mark>Al</mark> would never receive credit for giving Art Shell & Tom Flores an opportunities to be head coaches when no other owner would. And everyone plays it down, because it was only <mark>Al Davis</mark>, a maverick. Give the man credit! Up until the last decade or so, the Raiders were truly the team of the Decades, and the team of opportunity.", "articleID": "2016070906_00319891_W", "names": {"Doug Williams": ["Q1364004", "Q20687595", "Q28933869", "Q5301013", "Q5301014", "Q5301015", "Q5301016", "Q951164"], "Eddie Robinson": ["Q1151037", "Q1419778", "Q3047306", "Q5336448"]}}, {"date": "2016-07-10", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/deputy-pm-prescott-iraq-war-illegal-479186", "content": "Iraq War Was Illegal, Ex-deputy PM <mark>Prescott</mark> Says On 7/10/16 at 11:31 AM Close World Chilcot Report Iraq War Tony Blair British parliament Britain broke international law when it invaded Iraq in 2003, its deputy prime minister at the time, <mark>John Prescott</mark>, said on Sunday in the wake of a critical report on the decision to go to war. A seven-year inquiry concluded on Wednesday that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's justification, planning and handling of the Iraq War involved a catalog of failures, but did not rule whether the war was legal. Eight months before the 2003 invasion, Blair told former U.S. President George W. Bush \"I will be with you, whatever,\" eventually sending 45,000 British troops into battle when peace options had not been exhausted, the long-awaited British public inquiry said. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week <mark>Prescott</mark>, writing in the Sunday Mirror newspaper, said he had now changed his view about the legality of the war and criticized Blair for stopping his ministers from fully discussing in advance whether the war would be legal. \"In 2004, the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that as regime change was the prime aim of the Iraq War, it was illegal. With great sadness and anger, I now believe him to be right,\" <mark>Prescott</mark> wrote. Britain's former Deputy Prime Minister <mark>John Prescott</mark> arrives for a weekly cabinet meeting at Downing Street in London May 4, 2006. Reuters \"I will live with the decision of going to war and its catastrophic consequences for the rest of my life,\" he added. Many Britons want Blair to face criminal action over his decision to take military action that led to the deaths of 179 British soldiers and more than 150,000 Iraqi civilians over the following six years. \"The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, came to the Cabinet, verbally announced it was legal, but provided no documentation,\" <mark>Prescott</mark> said. \"The timing of the decision was clearly designed to endorse an almost immediate action for us to go to war .\" <mark>Prescott</mark> added that he backed the decision by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn--a veteran anti-war campaigner and critic of Blair--to apologize for the war on behalf of the party. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of lawmakers said they would seek next week a vote declaring Blair in contempt of parliament for misleading it in the run-up to the decision to go to war. \"Saying one thing to George W. Bush in private and a totally different thing to parliament and people in public, that is the parliamentary crime, the offence, and it is time for parliament to deliver a verdict,\" Scottish National Party lawmaker and former party leader Alex Salmond told ITV television. The possible implications of such a vote were not immediately clear, but the Sunday Times newspaper said it could see Blair barred from public office or stripped of his membership of the Privy Council, a largely ceremonial body that advises Queen Elizabeth.", "articleID": "2016071015_00657922_W", "names": {"John Prescott": ["Q332393", "Q58166586", "Q58166598"]}}, {"date": "2016-07-11", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/massachusetts-playbook/2016/07/equal-pay-bill-incoming-mind-those-budget-earmarks-happy-birthday-ed-markey-215241", "content": "The fights before the convention fight in Cleveland Christie builds his case for <mark>Trump</mark>'s VP Why <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> won't accept--or dismiss--<mark>Donald Trump</mark> The Year the Veepstakes Really Mattered An Unfair Tragedy for Unlucky Dallas Politico Massachusetts Playbook Lauren Dezenski's must-read rundown of what's up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

COMING THIS WEEK: EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION--Debate and a likely vote on the House's take on equal pay legislation which passed the Senate unanimously is expected to appeal to all sides thanks to tweaks from the House. More from yours truly in POLITICO Massachusetts--\"While the House language was not yet available late last week, those involved with negotiations say the bill will be amenable to all parties. It is currently being tweaked in the House Committee on Ways and Means .\" ...\"\"I would say that it's similar to the Senate version,' said Rep. Patricia Haddad, a Somerset Democrat. The main difference, she said, is that the House worked more closely with Associated Industries of Massachusetts in developing the legislation .\" ...\"In January, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to shrink the gap between men and women's wages by prohibiting potential employers from asking about salary history and establishing a definition for\" comparable work. \"'\" Associated Industries of Massachusetts, or AIM, was critical of the Senate's language. The group's president, Rick Lord, confirmed that his team has been closely working with House leadership as well as the Attorney General's office \"to hopefully come up with a bill out of the House that we would support .\" '...\"The Massachusetts High Tech Council, another group pushing back against the Senate proposal, sent a similar signal .\" Based on the conversations we've been having, we're optimistic about the House-produced bill. It will be an improvement over what the Senate did,' said public policy and communications executive vice president Mark Gallagher. \"READ ON--http: //politi.co/29ssPOE Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Massachusetts has one of the cleanest and lowest carbon-producing power generation systems in the nation. In fact, transportation today represents twice the carbon emissions of power plants in the Commonwealth. And despite talk of an \"energy cost crisis,\" the last two years have seen the lowest electricity prices in more than a decade. The energy plan being pushed on Beacon Hill, however, puts all this progress at risk by outsourcing up to a third of our electricity market to government-owned Canadian utilities and locking consumers into decades-long hydro contracts. If passed by the legislature, energy bills are estimated to increase by up to $777 million each year for Massachusetts families and businesses. Government-owned Canadian hydro is expensive, unreliable and not the solution for Massachusetts. Learn more: bit. ly/2928S3h ** Want to make an impact?
