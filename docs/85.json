"lydia davis, glenn gould & mary tyler moore having finished freedom, by jonathan franzen, my haphazard reading habits have caused me to pick up the collected stories of lydia davis, which more than caffeine has aroused my nervous system during midmorning, work-day coffee breaks. davis's \"fictions\" have been called crosses between stories, prose poems, and philosophic aphorisms. in an interview, she has said that she likes beckett for \"the plain, anglo-saxon vocabulary; the intelligence; the challenge to my intelligence; the humor that undercut what might have been a heavy message; and the self-consciousness about language .\" these are characteristics that one recognizes in davis's work, too. and another one that she did not mention, the bleak outlook. in a story called \"glenn gould,\" the narrator, a stay-at-home mother, makes a point of watching \"the mary tyler moore show\" whenever possible. it seems odd that one of my favorite tv shows plays a part in the last two books i've read. franzen's teen-aged patty emerson, watching at her home in westchester county, new york, is by way of this show introduced to my hometown of minneapolis, and to escape her affluent but damaged family of origin she accepts an athletic scholarship to the university of minnesota. davis's character, describing the attractions of the show, says: \"i want to stay in that other place, that other city that is a real city but one i have never visited .\" one feels that the language, here and almost everywhere in davis's work, is charged and allusive. the \"other place,\" \"that other city that is a real city but one i have never visited,\" is not really or just minneapolis, minnesota. it's where sane, grounded, decent, intelligent, mostly contented <mark>mary richards</mark> makes her home. that's the place the narrator hasn't been. she gives the impression that she regards \"the mary tyler moore show\" as a guilty pleasure and is therefore pleased to learn, in a letter from her friend mitch, that glenn gould, the great pianist she admires, is also a fan. in the course of the brief story (though, at nine pages, it's one of davis's longer ones), some of the pianist's characteristics are mentioned, and the movement is from the elevated (\"intelligent,\" \"high standards,\" \"articulate\" ) to the ominous (\"hypochondriac,\" \"excessively careful of his hands,\" \"was fond of a certain rather ugly female pop singer\" ). also, there is this: glenn gould did not have children. he was not married. the narrator is married and has a child. there is nothing in the story to indicate that either is a source of much satisfaction. the husband is barely in the story. when they eat dinner, they sometimes have little to talk about, so she will tell him about something funny from the last show. then, \"i can see that he is ready to laugh even before i tell it, though so often, in the case of other subjects, he is not terribly interested in what i say to him, especially when he sees that i am becoming enthusiastic .\" the sentence proceeds, clause by clause, to that final one: especially when he sees that i am becoming enthusiastic. that is all there is about the husband. her friend who tells her that glenn gould watches \"mary tyler moore\" is mitch but the husband is not named. one of the things the narrator mentions about glenn gould is that he \"was able to be selfish without hurting anyone .\" your comment could not be posted. error type: the letters and numbers you entered did not match the image. please try again.",

urges public to get vaccinated against influenza by habib toumi, bahrain bureau chief qatar recently received 40,000 doses of a new version of the seasonal influenza vaccine, which is currently being administered. manama: qatar's supreme council of health (sec) has allayed fears of a new outbreak of h1n1 in the country, following the death of a qatari woman last week. four people have died of h1n1 in qatar since the beginning of the year; the fourth was a pregnant qatari woman. however, the sch was quick to point out that such incidents are sporadic and do not indicate a return of the pandemic. the council, nevertheless, is strongly urging the public, especially high risk groups like pregnant women, to get vaccinated against seasonal influenza as a precautionary measure, qatari daily the peninsula reported on monday. the first death from h1n1 this year occurred in january and was followed by two more deaths in august, one in september and one in october. two of the last four victims were qatari women and the other two were indian nationals. however, the sch did not announce any of the deaths. \"we did not feel it necessary to announce each death because they were isolated incidents. there is no threat of a pandemic in qatar at this moment. the world health organisation (who) has also ruled out the possibility of a new outbreak of the disease,\" said dr mohammad al thani, director of the public health department at sch. however, he added that the latest incident involving the pregnant woman had come as a reminder of the need for vaccinating all vulnerable groups against seasonal flu. \"sch will launch an investigation into this incident to identify the causes and circumstances that led to the death of the woman. the twins she was bearing have been saved and are in healthy condition now. a medical team from the sch will be visiting the family of the deceased to check if any other members in the family are infected,\" he was quoted by the daily as saying. dr <mark>abdul lateef</mark> al khal, head of the communicable diseases section at hmc, said the woman, who was admitted into the intensive care unit of the hmc with pneumonia, was treated normally. \"she was tested negative of the influenza virus even though she was infected. this happens in some patients,\" said al khal. dr mohammad al hajari, head of the health protection and communicable disease control department at sch, highlighted the need for the seasonal flu vaccination. he pointed out that hundreds of people around the world die every year from seasonal influenza. qatar recently received 40,000 doses of a new version of the seasonal influenza vaccine, which is currently being administered. another consignment of 160,000 doses is expected by the end of this month. email a

how much of their money actually goes through to the people in need on the other end. so, they usually end up not donating at all, except for maybe some clothes to the goodwill every now and then. so what should you do? first, do research. read up on different charities you can donate to, perhaps more local ones if you can find them. talk to the people from the charities you research and ask them questions. ask your friends and people you know where they donate to and how much. but if that even seems like too much for you, then just go to freerice.com. i heard about free rice from a documentary on world hunger and poverty called one peace at a time (which was excellent by the way; be sure to pick it up from the library or add it to your netflix que!). what free rice is is a nonprofit game. several games to choose from to be precise. all you do is play the games and with every correct answer, you donate 10 grains of rice. you can play multiple choice games that test your vocabulary, grammar, famous paintings, chemistry symbols, geography, math and languages like spanish and french. if you get a question wrong, no grains of rice are donated. once you get a question correct, the 10 grains of rice are automatically and immediately donated. your following question will be harder, and your next three consecutive correct answers will progress you to a harder level. united nations world food programme. and you don't have to have an account to play free rice, you can start playing the moment the homepage loads. but you can have an account if you wish to track your totals of donated rice. and the best thing about donating to this charity is it's fun, educational, and addictive. i sat there and played free rice the first time i visited the site until i donated about 5,000 grains of rice. and i felt wonderful about it. there's no money lost in the process, it's just grains of rice being directly donated, and free rice donates 100 percent of it's earnings. the sponsors that advertise on the site are paying for the rice you donate. as quoted in the faq page on freerice.com, \"freerice is not sitting on a pile of rice. you and other freerice players earn it 10 grains at a time. here is how it works: when you play the game, sponsor banners appear on the bottom of your screen for every correct answer that you choose. the money generated by these banners is then used to buy the rice. so by playing, you generate the money that pays for the rice donated to hungry people .\" where does the rice go exactly? the grains of rice goes to hungry countries all over the globe, including bangladesh, cambodia, uganda, nepal, bhutan and myanmar. watch a video of free rice being donated in bangladesh. so who started this wonderful way to help stop world hunger? his name is <mark>john breen</mark>, and he launched the fabulous freerice.com in october of 2007. in march 2009, he donated free rice to the un world food program, and it's been accumulating billions of grains of rice since. so what are you waiting for? play free rice today, and as many days as you can, and tell all your friends about it who don't know how to contribute to charities or think it's too hard or not worth it! and if you have a blog, promote free rice on it by having a banner, which can be found here: 0y3qfmlgmr8o3qm45upqvasxqp5qzua%

protect sensitive computer networks against growing cyber threats. the department's use of top-level system integrators and entrepreneurs will continue to grow, along with the need for so-called\" active \"defenses that scan incoming code to shield network perimeters, <mark>robert butler</mark>, the pentagon's top official for cyber policy, said on wednesday .\" and as we thread those together, what we want to do is a very very tight partnership with industry, \"<mark>butler</mark>, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, told reporters at a breakfast session. one key goal, <mark>butler</mark> said, was to cut the lag between development of new protective technology and its deployment. he said the department also wants to promote supplier diversity, partly to guard its information technology supply chain against compromise. the pentagon's biggest suppliers--including lockheed martin corp, boeing co, northrop grumman corp, bae systems plc and raytheon co--all have big and growing cyber-related product and service lines for a market that has been estimated at $80 billion to $140 billion a year worldwide, depending on how broadly it is defined. <mark>butler</mark> declined to comment directly on newly expressed concerns by u.s. lawmakers about buying telecommunications hardware from companies such as huawei technologies co, a china-based network equipment maker founded by a retired chinese military officer .\" supply chain is a big issue that we are tracking, \"he said. part of the approach involves screening to verify components and sub-components, he said. the department is also seeking to understand how manufacturing processes are taking place and to manage risks, <mark>butler</mark> said. a group of lawmakers including senator joseph lieberman, chairman of the senate homeland security committee, asked the federal communications commission on tuesday to detail any security risks from network equipment made by huawei and zte corp, both based in shenzhen, china. the two\" are aggressively seeking to supply sensitive equipment for u.s. telecommunications infrastructure and/or serve as operator and administrator of u.s. networks, and increase their role in the u.s. telecommunications sector through acquisition and merger, \"lieberman said in a letter also signed by senators jon kyl and <mark>susan collins</mark> and representative sue myrick. a report commissioned by the congressionally chartered u.s.-china economic and security review commission said last year that beijing, at odds with washington over taiwan arms sales among other things, appeared to be conducting\" a long-term, sophisticated, computer network exploitation campaign \"against the u.s. government and u.s. defense industries. china has denied the charge, made in a survey carried out for the commission by northrop grumman, the pentagon's third-biggest supplier by sales. deputy defense secretary william lynn, who is leading the overall effort to protect the military's 15,000-plus computer networks, has said more than 100 foreign intelligence outfits are attempting to break in, and some\" already have the capacity to disrupt \"u.s. information infrastructure. <mark>butler</mark> cited what he called a growing threat from malicious software and\" botnets, \"or code that can drive automated tasks over the internet without computers' owners knowing. walling off power grids, the\" defense industrial base \"and other critical industries from the rest of the internet is\" one idea of a series of operating concepts that we are working through, \"he said .\" over the course of the next several months, i think we'll sort through a lot of this. \"u.s. senator sheldon whitehouse, who led a task force on the cyber threat for the senate select committee on intelligence, said the private sector is an essential partner in federal efforts to boost cybersecurity, with as much as 90 percent of internet infrastructure in private
