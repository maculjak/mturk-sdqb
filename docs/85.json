Emmanuel Macron had reportedly studied <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s style of domineering power-grabbing handshakes, apparently prepared to avoid being outdone by his counterpart. Instead, it was President Trump who at one point in the 5-second-long handshake attempted to withdraw his hand from Macron's firm grasp. The maneuver marked the start of what has become a close partnership between the two leaders, who recently joined forces along with the United Kingdom to strike Syria earlier this month. \"It's no secret that President Trump and President Macron enjoy a good working relationship. I may say a close personal relationship,\" a senior administration official said in a briefing with reporters. President Macron has already feted Trump in grand style, inviting him to be his guest of honor at France's elaborate Bastille Day celebrations last summer. The president and first lady dined with Macron and his wife at the Eiffel Tower and sat side-by-side as French military tanks, planes and troops rolled down the Champs-Elysee in the elaborate military parade. The event so inspired Trump that he has since called on the Pentagon to look into organizing a military parade in the United States. That parade is now set to take place on Veterans Day. By extending an invitation to host Macron for a state visit in the United States, Trump is in many ways returning the favor and celebrating the deeply-rooted historical ties between the two countries and marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. This will be the president and first lady's first time hosting a foreign leader to the full ceremonial honors of a state visit and sends a symbolic message about the value Trump places on his close ties with the French president. \"This will be a visit of symbolism of the strength and history of the U.S.-French relationship,\" says Heather A. Conley, senior vice president for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It will be more symbolism than substance .\" The events When Macron arrives in Washington on Monday for a three-day visit, he and his wife will stay at Blair House, the presidential guest house, and will dine privately with the president and first lady at George Washington's Mount Vernon home and pay a visit to the first president's tomb. \"President Trump is eager to host the Macrons for this special event, as he remembers fondly the dinner the couples shared together in the Eiffel tower on the eve of Bastille day last July,\" a senior administration official said. President Trump will officially welcome Macron to the White House on Tuesday with an elaborate welcome ceremony on its South Lawn, complete with honor guards and marching bands. They are scheduled to engage in bilateral meetings and partake in a joint news conference. Macron will also dine with Vice President Mike Pence at the State Department for a luncheon that is traditionally hosted by the Secretary of State, and visit the tomb of the unknown soldier. The day will conclude with a formal white-tie state dinner that has been in the works for several months at the personal direction of First Lady Melania Trump. Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush, said the dinner will be a chance for the first lady to showcase her skills as a hostess. McBride predicted that Melania Trump has put a keen interest in creating an elegant evening. \"Mrs. Trump wants her guests to have a wonderful, sensory experience. The flowers and lighting in the room. She pays great attention to detail. It's really a chance for her to show how they entertain,\" McBride said. The White House is closely guarding the invite list, with plans to only release the names of the invitees after the final guest has arrived for the evening, which is sure to include both French and American dignitaries. But the guest list is one of the most important and trickiest matters to navigate--to strike the right balance and set the desired tone. Several offices and departments are involved in the process, with recommendations flowing in from the State Department, the Office of Public Liaison--which largely manages the White House's relationship with outside groups--and the offices of Cabinet Affairs and legislative affairs, McBride said. But the most important suggestions of all, she added, are those that come from the first couple. \"The most important list of all is who the first family wants to have there,\" said McBride. As for what's on the menu, the White House has yet to reveal what will be served but says the first lady has personally selected and taste-tested the dishes. While some modern state dinners have been hosted in a large event tent on the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday's dinner will be in its State Dining Room. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, says the setting is a \"nod to tradition and the historic relationship between the two countries .\" She added that there has been an effort on the part of the first lady's office \"to keep things elegant and more traditional than perhaps some of the last few state dinners .\" The live musical accompaniment for the evening will be \"classical and traditional,\" says Grisham. She suggested the entertainment will be a departure from the modern artists who made a splash at some of former President Obama's state dinners, which included live performances from A-list artists like Gwen Stefani and Beyonce Knowles. On Wednesday, Macron will deliver an address to a joint session of Congress, which Elys\u00e9e Palace says will be a \"very important moment\" of Macron's visit. \"The French president will introduce himself to the American people, will send a message of friendship, of respect and affection toward the American nation,\" the Elys\u00e9e Palace says. \"Our common history is incredible, a history of friendship that started 250 years ago. The central message that we will see at the Congress will be: Do you want to continue to write history together?\" Macron will also make a public address at George Washington University, and hold his own news conference at the conclusion of his U.S. visit. The Issues Amid all the pomp and circumstance of the ceremonial visit, there will also be the work of high-level diplomacy between the two leaders and their delegations. Macron has described his relationship with Trump as \"extremely direct and frank,\" telling the BBC in January: \"Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail .\" Macron appeared to test the limits of that frankness when he seemed to take credit recently for convincing President Trump not to pull U.S. troops out of Syria in the immediate future; Trump had said days before that the U.S. mission in Syria was nearly complete and that troops would be coming home \"very soon .\" \"We convinced him that it was necessary to stay there long-term,\" Macron said during an extended televised interview on Sunday. The White House then came out to refute Macron's assertion. \"The U.S. mission has not changed--the President has been clear that he wants U.S. forces to come home as quickly as possible,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. And Macron himself also sought to walk back the comments, later attempting to clarify: \"I did not say that either the U.S. or France will remain militarily engaged in the long term in Syria .\" After the joint strike earlier this month and the public fissure around Macron's comments on the duration of a U.S. military commitment, one issue to watch will be whether the two countries come to any sort of shared understanding around next steps for war-torn Syria. A senior administration official said the leaders would \"discuss probably in some detail the way forward on Syria\" but said it's \"difficult to say right now\" how far those discussions will go. \"The question around Syria would be,\" Now what?' \"says Conley .\" President Macron very much wants to see a diplomatic process come through. He wants more U.S. engagement...[and] wants to talk to President Trump about what the U.S. policy towards Syria will be at the same moment where President Trump has publicly announced that his desire is to remove U.S. forces from Syria. \"Conley added that it will be interesting to see how the\" leaders comment publicly on their two positions on Syria and a diplomatic process moving forward. \"While the Elys\u00e9e Palace has made clear they don't have high expectations for producing substantive agreements, the French delegation will try their hand at the art of persuasion in presenting the French position on issues of disagreement, namely the Iran nuclear deal, trade, and the Paris Climate Accord .\" We hope that this State visit will be useful and allow us to present our arguments, to convince and move forward. But on these three topics, we do not expect to obtain results, make deals [or] agreements during the visit. For example, on the Iran deal, we know that President Trump has not made a decision yet. We do not think there will be a diplomatic breakthrough during the State visit, \"the Elys\u00e9e Palace said. A senior administration official said the Iran nuclear deal is sure to be a\" a major topic of discussion \"during the meetings but said that any decisions as it relates to the United States' continuing participation in the agreement would come in mid-May, when the president faces a deadline on whether to continue to keep the U.S. a party to the deal. Even as both U.S. and French officials say there's no expectation that a final decision will be reached on the Iran deal during the visit, Conley says Macron is uniquely suited among European leaders to make potential headway with Trump as he seeks to convince him not to withdraw the United States from the pact .\" This visit will be dubbed the \"Save the Iran Nuclear Agreement' trip,\" Conley said. \"The French have historically been the toughest EU of the three--that's U.K., France, and Germany--on being tough on Iran, getting the toughest compliance possible. So in some ways, President Macron is the best to provide the president with...the toughness that he wants about and towards Iran, but trying to do so in a way that preserves the Iran nuclear agreement .\" But as it relates to the Paris Climate Accord--the historic pact on climate change to which President Obama had previously committed the United States and has since been adopted by every other country in the world--the Elys\u00e9e Palace says President Macron will refrain from trying to convince President Trump to get back on board with the agreement. \"We are not trying to get the United States back into the Paris Accord,\" the Elys\u00e9e Palace said. \"What we are doing is describing the consequences of climate change. We continue scientific and economic cooperation with the U.S.. This goes beyond the U.S. Federal state; working with American cities, NGOs, companies. By working collectively, the United States will reach their objective of decreasing gas emissions. On the political aspect, it can show the Trump administration the positive consequences of actions to fight climate change in terms of job creations and innovation .\" Asked if Paris Climate Accord is set to be discussed, a senior administration official said, \"I don't have any insight on that for you\" and said the topic is not on the agenda \"unless it's brought up by President Macron .\" Related Topics: abc news national SHARE: share tweet share email (Copyright \u00a9 2018 ABC News Internet Ventures .)

The Scottish First Minister used a speech in London on Monday to urge Westminster politicians to vote down any compromise deal the Prime Minister can strike with Brussels. She accused the UK Government of \"threatening us with fire, to make us choose the frying pan\" , and argued that any deal that is presented to the Commons was likely to be deliberately vague about the future relationship and damaging to the UK's interests. Ms Sturgeon told an audience at the Royal Society of Arts that voting down the Prime Minister's proposal would allow a deal keeping the UK in the customs union and single market--which the SNP wants--to be presented instead. Voting against \"a bad or blindfold Brexit\" was not a vote for no-deal, she argued, but \"the only chance the House of Commons will have to reset these negotiations and think again before it is too late\". She said: \"As the crucial vote looms closer, it is also time for individual members of the House of Commons to consider what compromises they see as justified--and which are not--if they are to serve their constituents, and the wider public interest .\" If they do that, I believe that a commonsense outcome could yet be found. \"Ms Sturgeon has said the SNP's strong preference is to remain in the EU (Jane Barlow/PA) She added:\" For MPs to support a bad or blindfold Brexit--a cobbled-together withdrawal agreement and a vague statement about our future relationship--would, in my view, be a dereliction of duty. \"In the June 2016 referendum, Scotland voted by 62% to 38% in favour of remaining in the EU. As part of her speech, the First Minister presented a new paper from the Scottish Government--Scotland's Place in Europe: Our Way Forward. It noted that the\" core \"of the proposal was the same as it set out in December 2016. Writing in her foreword to the paper, Ms Sturgeon said:\" The Scottish Government, in line with the overwhelming vote for Remain in Scotland, supports continued EU Membership. Remaining in the EU continues to be our strong preference. \"Nevertheless in December 2016 we set out a compromise plan to keep Scotland and the UK in the European Single Market and Customs Union to limit the damage of Brexit as much as possible .\" It is therefore simply incorrect for the Prime Minister to say that there is no alternative to Chequers. \"In fact, the UK Government's position is increasingly absurd--insisting on pursuing proposals they have been told will not work while rejecting a plan that will .\" She adds: \"With crucial decisions coming up over the next few weeks and months at EU level--and in the House of Commons, where the UK Government must seek the approval of the UK Parliament--it is vital to break the deadlock .\" For the Prime Minister and the UK Government it is time to face reality. For MPs at Westminster it is time to come together in a commonsense coalition to minimise the Brexit damage. \"A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union (Dexeu) said:\" We will have an ambitious course outside of the EU that enhances our prosperity and security and that genuinely works for everyone across the UK. \"We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU and look forward to continuing to engage with the EU Commission on our proposals .\" 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2016052005_00860440_W", "names": {"Chris Brown": ["Q14951440", "Q155700", "Q240686", "Q2964666", "Q3022478", "Q5105666", "Q5105993", "Q5105995", "Q5105996", "Q5105998", "Q5105999", "Q5106001", "Q5106002", "Q5106003", "Q5106004", "Q5106005", "Q5106007", "Q5106008", "Q5106009", "Q5111994", "Q5112603", "Q51543886", "Q58314139"], "Sam Smith": ["Q15123969", "Q15522057", "Q16226475", "Q27763826", "Q3946359", "Q3946360", "Q41249297", "Q41787201", "Q50382049", "Q7408170", "Q7408171", "Q7408172", "Q7408177", "Q7408178", "Q7408180", "Q7408733"], "J.

Obviously Cone did watch the three episodes of the TNT-Meralco quarterfinal series and got something to focus on in the semifinals of the PBA Commissioner's Cup. \"The TnT/Meralco series was an epic battle, but it presents a very interesting matchup for us,\" said Cone, whose Gin Kings will play the Tropang Texters in the best-of-5 semifinal series starting today at the Mall of Asia Arena. Cone is visibly impressed with the way the Texters executed what he called their \"in and out game' and import <mark>Joshua Smith</mark>'s flexibility on both ends of the court. <mark>Smith</mark> actually averaged 22.2 points and 24 rebounds as he stood at the forefront of the Tropang Texters who beat Meralco in three games in the quarterfinals. Needless to say, the Gin Kings need to put more premium on defending what Cone describes as a\" massive' TNT import. \"We're going to have to find ways to battle their in and out game with their massive import,\" said Cone, who is looking to bring the Gin Kings to their third straight finals appearance under his watch. \"It will be tough for us to defend. We have problems dealing with huge import, and we have to figure that out,\" added Cone. On the other hand, the Texters will have to find ways to keep pace with the Gin Kings' quickness and Cone himself is saying that. \"They, of course, will have to find ways to stop our quickness and like I said, (the series is) very interesting indeed,\" said Cone, who is counting on import Justin Brownlee, Japeth Aguilar and Joe Devance, <mark>Scottie Thompson</mark> who all run faster. One interesting matchup that's expected to highlight the 6:30 p.m. opener of their brief series is between L.A. Tenorio of Ginebra and TNT's Jayson Castro. The Gin Kings asserted their might as the playoff top seed and crushed Globalport, 96-85, to advance to the semis Tuesday in a game marred by the ejection of Batang Pier's top gunner Terrence Romeo.

Our 6 \ufe0f \u20e3 th consecutive English trophy!?? \u26bd \ufe0f @ QNetOfficial?? #ManCity #CarabaoCup pic.twitter.com/5SjNPP4dTp--Manchester City (@ ManCity) March 1, 2020 A third successive Premier League title looks beyond them but the FA Cup and Champions League are still very much on the radar. Left-back <mark>Zinchenko</mark> said: \"It is so important for us to win every title. We are so happy. We have an unbelievable squad and we fight for all titles .\" So everyone is happy, but we should think about the next game because we have one or two other challenges. We want to fight. \"We have to show our class in our performance every single game and then at the end of the season we are going to speak about if it was a good season for us or if it was successful or not. The Captain. The Man of the Match. #EFL #CarabaoCup #CarabaoCupFinal #ManCity #MCFC pic.twitter.com/eYtRxTJY3t--PepTeam (@ PepTeam) March 1, 2020\" We have Champions League and FA Cup as well. We are going to fight for these titles and see what happens. Everyone is focused on the next game and that is it. \"City are back in action on Wednesday as they travel to Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup fifth round. They then have Premier League games against Manchester United and Burnley before their Champions League quest resumes with the second leg of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid at the Etihad Stadium on March 17. City hold a 2-1 aggregate lead from the first leg at the Bernabeu last week. City had to earn their latest success as relegation-threatened Villa fought back after conceding to Sergio Aguero and Rodri in the first half an hour. Mbwana Samatta pulled one back and it took a brilliant late save from <mark>Claudio Bravo</mark>, tipping a Bjorn Engels header onto a post, to prevent the match going to extra time .????

Twice in the 2017-18 run he was the hero in penalty shootouts, against Wolves and Leicester, and after missing most of last season through injury, he has played throughout this year's challenge. <mark>Zinchenko</mark> said:\" One year ago someone said we have to change the name of the cup, so not Carabao Cup, we should say it is the <mark>Claudio Bravo</mark> Cup. \"He did it again for us. Thanks a lot to him. Everyone was talking about him in the dressing room .\" It was a battle. Big respect to Aston Villa. They were well organised defensively and it was not too easy. \"0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2010012017_00172347_W", "names": {"Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]}, "date": "2010-01-20", "url":
