(ap)--the estranged father of actress lindsay lohan was back in police custody thursday, hours after being released from a tampa jail on domestic violence charges. tampa police responded to a 911 call from <mark>michael lohan</mark>'s on-and-off girlfriend early thursday. kate major told police <mark>lohan</mark>, 51, made a harassing phone call to her shortly after being released from jail wednesday afternoon. <mark>lohan</mark> called again while police were at major's condo. major, 28, put the call on speaker so police could listen. after hearing what <mark>lohan</mark> said, the police department notified the hillsborough county state attorney's office of a violation of judge <mark>walter heinrich</mark>'s pre-trial release orders that he stay away from major and an arrest order was authorized. police went to the tahitian inn in tampa, where <mark>lohan</mark> was reportedly staying. according to a news release from police, <mark>lohan</mark> spotted the officers and jumped off a third-floor balcony in an attempt to escape. <mark>lohan</mark> was arrested after a short pursuit on foot. he was taken into police custody and taken to the hillsborough county jail. there, deputies suspected he may have broken his foot when he jumped off the balcony, so he was taken to tampa general hospital for evaluation. authorities said he will be returned to the jail once he's been cleared by doctors. <mark>lohan</mark> was arrested tuesday on domestic violence charges involving major, a former reporter for the star tabloid. police say he grabbed her arms and pushed her down multiple times during a daylong argument. when <mark>lohan</mark> was released from jail wednesday, he said he \"didn't do anything\" and the charges were major's way of making money. the st. petersburg times (reported that <mark>lohan</mark> claimed major set him up to be overheard by police thursday. \"she needs help, she calls me, and i'm a sucker so i call her back. i'm an idiot,\" <mark>lohan</mark> said as he was being put into the back of a police cruiser. in july, a misdemeanor domestic violence charge against <mark>lohan</mark> stemming from a fight with major was dismissed in los angeles after she failed to show up for the trial. <mark>lohan</mark>'s attorney said major declined to cooperate to avoid a court spectacle. <mark>lohan</mark> has a history of arrests in new york over allegations of harassment from ex-girlfriends. meanwhile, his daughter lindsay lohan could also return to jail in california after a judge last week ruled she violated probation involving a community service assignment. a nov. 2 court date was set to decide whether lindsay lohan should be jailed. the 25-year-old actress was given probation for a 2007 drunken driving case and a misdemeanor theft case this year.", "articleID": "2011102713_00047301_W", "names": {"Walter Heinrich": ["Q14947282", "Q54556191"]}}, {"date": "2011-10-28", "url":

with so many games on the horizon. \"we had to make a few tough decisions in terms of selection. leaving darren cave out of the side was very difficult considering the form he was in. paddy (wallace) and nevin (spence) struck up a good relationship last season and it's a tried and tested combination. we know with darren on the bench, it will give us a bit of quality there and it gives us great options .\" we have a long run of games no and it's important that we get off on the right foot against scarlets. we will be looking for a good performance as well as a good result. \"ulster go into

army corps of engineers has called on federal and state agencies to turn the faucet down at the lake thurmond dam and keep more water in upstate lakes, a u.s. army corps of engineers official said thursday. col. <mark>jeff hall</mark>, commander of the corps' savannah district, said that will happen as soon as all agencies involved agree to plans similar to action taken in 2007 as the last drought gripped the region. \"conditions are eerily similar to what we saw in 2007,\" <mark>hall</mark> told greenvilleonline.com. a la nina is strengthening in the pacific, which typically means a drier winter and spring along the savannah river basin, <mark>hall</mark> said. could lake hartwell sink to the historic low seen in 2008 as that drought continued? it's possible, <mark>hall</mark> said. on the other hand, the upstate could get rain in the spring and go to full pool, he said. or the lakes could drop to a new low. the corps is taking proactive actions and following the steps it took in 2007, working with other agencies, to do what it can under current policy, <mark>hall</mark> said. currently, the corps is letting the minimum amount of water out of the dam allowed under its current drought plan. with the cooperation of the other agencies, the amount would be reduced another 200 cubic feet per second to 3,600 cubic feet per second, <mark>hall</mark> said. <mark>hall</mark> was in anderson to speak with members of the lake hartwell association, which has pushed for earlier action to lower the flow out of upstate lakes in drought. one of the things herb burnham, president of the more than 2,000-member association, wants to know is why the proposed action couldn't have been taken sooner. hartwell was full in july, <mark>hall</mark> said, and the corps must follow its current guidelines, which were adopted in 2006. to make major changes, the corps drought plan has to be changed, and a comprehensive study is needed to do that, he said. the latest holdup has been that south carolina hasn't been able to come up with its share, even as an in-kind contribution. that soon could change, <mark>hall</mark> said. \"we're working an out-of-the-box solution,\" <mark>hall</mark> said. the nature conservancy has offered to make south carolina's contribution, and paperwork details with lawyers are in the works to begin phase two, <mark>hall</mark> said. the first phase of the study was done a few years ago. the second phase of the plan could allow the corps to move trigger levels higher, which means restricting flow out of the thurmond dam earlier in drought, <mark>hall</mark> said. that depends on what the study finds as the entire stretch of the savannah river is studied from water supplies for drinking and industry to protection of endangered species including the short nose sturgeon, which need a decent flow to spawn. <mark>hall</mark> is excited about another new tool that will be available through clemson university's intelligent river project. the project will place computerized sensors along the length of the savannah that will provide real-time data. the savannah \"will be the most monitored river in the world,\" <mark>hall</mark> said.", "articleID": "2011102814_00051585_W", "names": {"Jeff Hall": ["Q1975504", "Q19867493", "Q6173990", "Q6173992"]}}, {"date": "2011-10-30", "url":

insist that the government can't create jobs, and who have argued that lower, not higher, federal spending is the key to recovery - have rushed to oppose any cuts in military spending. why? because, they say, such cuts would destroy jobs. thus representative buck mckeon, republican of california, once attacked the obama stimulus plan because \"more spending is not what california or this country needs .\" but two weeks ago, writing in the wall street journal, mr. mckeon - now the chairman of the house armed services committee - warned that the defense cuts that are scheduled to take place if the supercommittee fails to agree would eliminate jobs and raise the unemployment rate. oh, the hypocrisy! but what makes this particular form of hypocrisy so enduring?...paul krugman you know as well as i do! building weapons is more productive than building infrastructure? of course not. because politicians are nuts, that's why, and if you don't believe me, take a look at keynes' understanding of the their hypocrisy. but why would anyone prefer spending on destruction to spending on construction, prefer building weapons to building bridges? <mark>john maynard</mark> keynes himself offered a partial answer 75 years ago, when he noted a curious \"preference for wholly\" wasteful' forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict \"business' principles .\" spend money on some useful goal, like the promotion of new energy sources, and people start screaming, \"solyndra! waste!\" spend money on a weapons system we don't need, and those voices are silent, because nobody expects f-22s to be a good business proposition. and now they're pushed even farther into hypocrisy with the possibility that the debt reduction super-committee may fizzle and force us into huge defense cuts. .. to admit that public spending on useful projects can create jobs is to admit that such spending can in fact do good, that sometimes government is the solution, not the problem. fear that voters might reach the same conclusion is, i'd argue, the main reason the right has always seen keynesian economics as a leftist doctrine, when it's actually nothing of the sort. true. if you actually read keynes, you'll know he was no lefty. need a shortcut? insta-keynes? try this. we don't need is further proof that republicans will do anything, spread any rumor, indulge in any sustained form of ignorance, fool with any ballot box, or spread any slur to increase power. see, they'd like us to believe that their government (if they should take control of it) is not useless. after all, george w. bush expanded government massively. their government spending is good spending. like the f-22s, like the preemptive, unjustified and unwinnable wars and further, unneeded, tax cuts for the wealthiest and even for corporations who send jobs overseas. their spending, after all, results in a huge tip going right into their own pockets via the pockets of the top 1%. and bank failures and deep recessions...your comment could not be posted. error type: the letters and numbers you entered did not match the image.
