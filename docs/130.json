alcoholics anonymous meeting. it's merely the latest amble into tone-deafness for a movie that, despite a lot of funny lines and a committed performance by the big screen's newest professional drunk, russell brand, fails. the original arthur (dudley moore) wouldn't have dreamed of twelve step meetings. the makers of that first film, which was a huge hit and won john gielgud an oscar, were just as politically incorrect in their day. but they knew, even while making a giggling drunken wastrel their hero in the early days of mothers against drunk driving, of celebrating a wealthy spendthrift in the reagan recession, how much of a buzz-kill the very idea of of aa interrupting arthur's bender would be. the new \"arthur\" has a winning cast - brand, helen mirren in the john gielgud role, jennifer garner as the rich girl arthur is ordered to marry and the charming greta gerwig in the poor little liza minnelli role. it's got some zingers recycled from the first movie and more than a few new one-liners that land. \"did you kill minnie mouse, or did she surrender that dress willingly?\" hobson (mirren) sneers at arthur's new infatuation (gerwig). brand is arthur bach, a rich brit brat whose wicked wicked ways have made him a fixture in the new york tabloids. we meet him as he and his chauffeur (<mark>luis guzman</mark>) run the batmobile - yes, he's bought it - under the wall street bull statue. arthur has more cars than jay leno, more toys that toys r us and has grown up so pampered and spoiled that he knows nothing of the real world. but one arrest too many - he extravagantly and generously bails everybody at the jail - forces a meeting with his frosty, distant mum (geraldine james). \"i remember from when i used to live in your womb!\" when mother stops going on about \"that charming coffee-colored gentleman who runs the country,\" she decrees that arthur must marry susan, her favorite ruthless go-getter executive. she's played with a venal verve by jennifer garner, and the fact you kind of root for her throws the whole story out of balance. then there's the hand-to-mouth tour guide arthur meets on his way home from the auction where he bought the suit lincoln wore to his second inaugural, a suit he promptly dons. he rescues naomi (gerwig) from arrest (she has no license) with a bit of fanciful invention. the cops want to see his id. arthur produces a penny. there isn't any chemistry between brand and gerwig, which may explain why she's not in the commercials or the poster. she's winsome and fetching, but the spark isn't there. meanwhile, the wedding plans continue apace, and we see just how far gone nick nolte's voice is - he's the two-fisted, menacing builder who is the father of the bride. arthur accidentally shoots him with his own nail gun and jokes about how nails in the hands \"made a hero out of jesus .\" oh no he didn't. the first 45 minutes of this have plenty of laughs as we navigate \"the vast moat of champagne called last night\" and enjoy mirren's way with a one-liner. brand's offhand delivery of a whispered \"help me\" to the diners in a restaurant where arthur is forced to propose and garner's drunken seduction scene - the one involving arthur's magnetic levitation bed that you see in the commercials - are a stitch. but i never bought mirren's nanny snobbery (gielgud sold it, and how), arthur's foray into the world of working people (a job at dylan's, new york's most famous candy store) and i don't want to know why arthur drinks. not for a comedy. overlong, overcast and a lot more politically correct than it lets on, this \"arthur\" is on the rocks long before last call .: pg-13 for alcohol use throughout, sexual content, language and some drug references. cast:. russell brand,

members involved in prostitution scandal, sources say colombian officials hoped to showcase city of catagena published on: apr 18 2012 03:03:32 am edt washington (cnn) - five u.s. army special forces service members are among those under investigation in a prostitution scandal in colombia, according to two u.s. officials, as the scandal continues to swell in both countries. eleven secret service members have been implicated in the investigation, while as many as 10 u.s. military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential involvement in any misconduct. moyer becomes oldest winning pitcher at...middleton's friend apologizes for gun...interior minister nausicrate perez said officials are waiting to get more information on the allegations that secret service agents brought prostitutes back to their hotel in colombia ahead of u.s. president barack obama's visit to the summit over the weekend. the americans were in cartagena to prepare for obama's visit, and the u.s. president has said he expects a \"rigorous\" investigation. the investigation is being led by secret service director <mark>mark sullivan</mark>, who has been briefing members of congress. homeland security secretary janet napolitano lauded the director for taking \"immediate and decisive action,\" which reflects the \"professionalism, honor, and integrity\" of the service. \"the u.s. secret service has a history of executing its mission with professionalism, honor and integrity and director <mark>sullivan</mark>'s six-year stewardship of the agency has been marked by these traits,\" napolitano said in a statement tuesday. \"in the aftermath of allegations of personnel misconduct in colombia, director <mark>sullivan</mark> took immediate and decisive action to remove the agents involved, investigate what transpired and ensure the secret service continued performing their vital protection mission .\" a leading senator said tuesday that she had been told as many as 21 women had been involved and questioned whether the incident could have endangered the president. \"who were these women? could they have been members of groups hostile to the united states? could they have planted bugs, disabled weapons or in any other (ways) jeopardized security of the president or our country?\" asked maine's <mark>susan collins</mark>, the ranking republican on the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee. that account was disputed by u.s. secret service spokesman ed donovan, who said the exact number of women was still under investigation. \"sen. <mark>susan collins</mark>, in a conversation with the secret service, was told that 21 u.s. personnel are involved in the investigation, and she evidently misconstrued that to mean that 21 prostitutes were involved,\" a source familiar with the investigation said. <mark>collins</mark>' office disagreed with that account, saying, \"there was no misunderstanding .\" \"the whole behavior is so incredibly dangerous and risky particularly for those who are charged with the solemn obligation of protecting the president of our country,\" <mark>collins</mark> told cnn. later, kevin kelley, a spokesman for <mark>collins</mark>, said the number is not the issue. \"it's outrageous that the department is arguing about the number when, clearly, this incident never should have happened in the first place,\" kelley said. the secret service agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, and all have been interviewed at least once, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said monday. their security clearances have been pulled while the investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared, the officials said. the agents were offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a u.s. official. some of the agents and military personnel maintain that they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. \"even if they weren't (prostitutes), it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive,\" rep. <mark>peter king</mark>, r-new york, the chairman of the house homeland security committee, said on cnn's \"piers morgan tonight .\" house oversight committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r-california, said the agents should take the polygraph tests. \"for these individuals, if they want to have any career at all, they have to decide on telling the entire truth and seeing whether they have something going forward .\" issa said his level of confidence in <mark>sullivan</mark> is \"high .\" while soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, displaying conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct

Silva</mark> to Remain in Broward Jail as Bond Hearing Is Delayed <mark>Thiago Silva</mark> lost a round in court Friday. \"Nobody's deliberately doing it, but he's definitely falling through the cracks,\" said attorney Scott Saul in a Broward County courtroom, speaking at what was supposed to be a bond hearing for <mark>Silva</mark>, 31. The mixed martial arts fighter sat in his jailhouse scrubs, watching his lawyer do the fighting. Saul argued that <mark>Silva</mark> should be out on bond, since he is no longer being charged with a non-bondable crime. \"And here we are two weeks later, my client is sitting in jail, not on the felonies, on bondable offenses, and he has no bond,\" Saul told the judge. Broward Sheriff's Office deputies arrested <mark>Silva</mark> on Feb. 6, saying he pulled a gun on his estranged wife in the parking lot of a gym, put the gun in her mouth, threatened to kill her, and then locked himself into a townhouse until SWAT team deputies talked him into surrendering peacefully. He was booked into the Broward County Main Jail, and there he stays. On Friday the state moved his case to the domestic violence court, delaying a bond hearing by about a week. \"We're gonna get him out of prison, this is (expletive), honestly, the state has known for a week this hearing was scheduled for today and did nothing,\" said <mark>Silva</mark>'s manager, <mark>Glenn Robinson</mark>. More than a dozen friends showed up in the courtroom to be in <mark>Silva</mark>'s corner. \"He has a tremendous amount of support, he's a very beloved person,\" Saul said. <mark>Silva</mark>'s lawyer says this case is an aberration, and that <mark>Silva</mark> has no criminal record. His manager doesn't believe the charges. \"It's not true, and the truth will come out,\" <mark>Robinson</mark> said. This much is definitely true: the criminal case has knocked out <mark>Silva</mark>'s career. The UFC fired him, and assuming he eventually bonds out of jail, he still faces a trial, and prison time if convicted.

a visit by bahrain's king to sunni supporters this week was also something of a royal blessing for a rising political star: an islamic scholar who claims the gulf kingdom is under threat from both foe iran and ally america. once consigned to the fringes, sunni hard-liners like abdullatif al-mahmood are suddenly gaining a receptive audience amid a government crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. it's another sign of bahrain's deeply polarized atmosphere as the kingdom's sunni rulers try to open talks with the shiite opposition after violence that has left 31 people dead since february. al-mahmood's group appears to be tapping into deep-rooted fears over shiite giant iran and growing questions about commitment from washington, which bases the u.s. navy's 5th fleet in bahrain .\" we won't compromise on the safety of our nation, \"al-mahmood said during the tuesday visit by king hamad bin isa al khalifa. it was a clear slap at iran, who bahrain's leaders and gulf arab allies accuse of stirring the shiite-led demonstrations in bahrain. he also rejected calls by some u.s. officials to cut bahrain's special trade status following the clampdown on dissent .\" crises don't scare us, \"said the king as al-mahmood stood nearby. bahrain's shiites account for about 70 percent of the island, but they have few allies in high places. they claim the sunni ruling system is built to block shiites from any key positions in government or security forces. the sunni monarchy's western backers, led by the u.s., have denounced the unrest and harsh crackdowns. on wednesday, eight shiite activists were sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the unrest and next week more than 30 doctors and nurses accused of supporting the protests are due to go on trial. but washington and others still have not followed up with any tangible punishments against bahrain's rulers. at the same time, bahrain has pushed a narrative that splits the nation into patriots or traitors .\" loyalty \"books and website have been set up to publicly support the monarchy, and anyone challenging the system is branded a potential enemy of the state by official media. this is where al-mahmood and other sunni hard-liners have found a new voice in bahrain's political affairs. al-mahmood's ultra-nationalist sunni bloc failed to win parliament seats in elections last year. now the bahrain university lecturer is drawing new attention as he accuses iran and lebanese-based hezbollah of meddling in bahrain .\" this is a well-known fact that iran has a project to expand its influence all over the region and dominate the arab world, \"he told the associated press .\" this is their ideology. \"washington would have few objections to that point of view. but al-mahmood also comes down hard against the u.s., saying that american criticism of bahrain has\" made us suspicious that they also have a hand in the recent crisis. \"in an interview in april with an islamic-oriented malaysian website, al-akham. net, al-mahmood portrayed many shiites as fundamentally unable to support a sunni-ruled state .\" how can you trust them when they put up pictures of (iranian revolution founder ruhollah) khomeini...how can the state trust them? \"he was quoted as saying. he went further, however, to claim that the u.s. is somehow supporting iran to create a\" vast shiite state \"in the gulf and iraq .\" the truth is there is no hostility between iran and the u.s., \"he told the website .\" there are mutual interests and roles between the two. \"such claims are light-years outside the standard policy views. they do, however, shed some light on the extreme outlooks among some of those who have gained favor with bahrain's rulers since the uprising began. in april, bahrain's prime minister praised al-mahmood's national unity gathering group as a symbol of\" everything pertaining to the nation's interest and future. \"opposition groups consider the organization a haven for hard-liners. a message on a pro-reform website called al-mahmood the\" latest weapon against the pro-democracy movement. \"officials appear to sense the shiite unhappiness with al-mahmood's comments. the prime minister -

Your weather is set to comments Live report: Princeton discusses town's first post-consolidation audit PRINCETON - Council is discussing the town's first post-consolidation audit, with a \"corrective action\" resolution on the agenda to address recommendations. The former Princeton borough and township officially consolidated on Jan. 1, 2013. \"Given the complication of bringing two municipalities together, I'm pleased with the results of that audit,\" Mayor Liz Lempert said Monday afternoon. \"There are some items on there in the corrective action plan that will be adopted .\" The audit was conducted by Hodulik & <mark>Morrison</mark> of Highland Park. One recommendation is that the financial accounting software budget module's data entry privileges be reviewed and modified to limit the ability to override controls to authorized personnel. In response to that recommendation, the town said new finance software is in place to limit the ability to override system controls to Kathy Monzo, director of finance, and Sandra Webb, chief financial officer, according to the corrective action resolution. Another recommendation included making sure reports of credit card payments of parking costs be obtained and checked against amounts paid by the card companies to assure all parking revenues are received timely. Princeton said software changes were made at the Bank of America, and \"this is an on-going issue that we are still attempting to resolve,\" according to the resolution. mandatory quarantine issued Friday by state health officials for members of an NBC crew - which includes Princeton resident Dr. Nancy Snyderman - that was exposed to Ebola.

Vicente del Bosque's men arrived in Brazil as one of the pre-tournament favourites having triumphed in South Africa four years ago, as well as retaining its UEFA European Championship title in 2012. However, Spain's World Cup defence began in a disastrous fashion as Louis van Gaal's side stormed to a shock 5-1 Group B victory in Salvador on Saturday (AEST). Xabi Alonso's 27th-minute penalty had appeared to put Spain in a strong position, but Robin van Persie's superb headed equaliser shortly before the break triggered a second-half demolition from the Dutch. Several Spain stars came in for heavy criticism after the crushing defeat, none more so than <mark>Iker Casillas</mark>, with some calling for the Real Madrid goalkeeper to be dropped from the starting XI. Del Bosque may retain faith in his captain, however, as David de Gea is struggling for fitness owing to a muscle injury, leaving Pepe Reina as the only alternative. Central defensive pair <mark>Sergio Ramos</mark> and Gerard Pique as well as Brazil-born striker Diego Costa also faced scrutiny for their performances, but it remains to be seen if Del Bosque will change his line-up or hand an opportunity to the side that failed so spectacularly last week. Regardless of who gets the nod at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday (AEST), the result will offer some indication as to whether Spain can mount a challenge to return to the iconic stadium for the final on 14 July (AEST). It is the second time in as many World Cups that the teams have faced off, Spain triumphing 2-1 in 2010, although both sides still progressed from Group H. A repeat victory could re-invigorate Spain - which lost its first match in South Africa before going all the way - and forward <mark>Juan Mata</mark> believes a strong team bond can help it overcome the poor start. \"We have strong faith in our football, in our ideas and we really believe we can overcome the situation,\" he said. \"This group is like a family since I arrived here .\" I think it's vital this kind of friendship between all of us, this familiar feelings which have made the Spain national team into a successful team. \"Chile started its campaign with a 3-1 victory over Australia, but that scoreline somewhat belied the difficulty that Jorge Sampaoli's side faced in Cuiaba. The South Americans were fluent in attack, with Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez particularly lively, yet goalkeeper <mark>Claudio Bravo</mark> was required to make a series of saves to deny Australia at least a draw. Chile has failed to beat Spain in 10 meetings between the teams and even a point could prove crucial in its bid to qualify for the knockout stages. However, midfielder Arturo Vidal - who managed 60 minutes against Australia as he continues to recover from knee surgery and has declared himself fit to play Spain - insists Chile is only interested in a maximum haul."}]
