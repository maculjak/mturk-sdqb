Davis/The Washington Post) Aaron C. Davis March 17 at 2:19 PM But if that's what you like - a dank, resinous pint - or if you're willing to at least try it, this could be your kind of St. Patrick's Day in D.C.. The District's DC Brau will tap a few green-decorated kegs of its new seasonal india pale ale dubbed \"Smells Like Freedom\" on Tuesday night, for what is bound to be a first in the District's protracted fight for full voting rights. threats of jail time by congressional Republicans. Possession, sharing and home cultivation of marijuana is now legal in the District. But Congress has blocked legal sales or purchases of pot. conflict has spurred sit-ins, marches, and as late as Tuesday, a band of pro-marijuana advocates dressed up in colonial garb who barged into the Capitol Hill office of House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a leading opponent of legalization in D.C.. The protestors offered a glass peace pipe of sorts. Chaffetz's staffers declined. Brewing a marijuana protest beer, however, was far less spontaneous. It's been fermenting, in fact, since last fall, said Brandon Skall, chief executive and co-founder of DC Brau Brewing Co. DC Brau and Longmont, Colo.-based Oskar Blues Brewing, both of which bottle their beers in cans, had for more than a year been looking for a reason to team up on a brewing project. In e-mails last fall, Skall said he laid out the case for doing a beer together around D.C.'s legalization effort and the rarely-noticed plight of the 650,000 D.C. residents who have no voting rights in Congress. Oskar executives were sold, and brewers there took to their lab, Skall said. They found three experimental hops that, when combined, produced a distinctly marijuana-like aroma. \"The experimental hops were definitely unique,\" said DC Brau brewer <mark>Christopher Graham</mark>. \"Some were over the top with melon. Some had a lot of berry notes. But all had that undertone of piney, resinous, dank quality that someone would expect from a nugget\" of marijuana, he said. For Skall, the issue is more about the tax bill he said he pays every year to the District while feeling like a second-class citizen. \"I'll tell you straight up, I don't smoke pot,\" Skall said, \"but I believe 100 percent in people's freedom to do so. I think that if we didn't have people standing for the end of prohibition that this business would not be here today .\" But at root, he said, it's about the fact that the District could only partially legalize marijuana, instead of fully like Colorado, which designated much of the revenue from taxes on pot to go to schools. \"Something needs to change with D.C., it's ridiculous,\" Skall said. \"I live here, I'm about to have a second child here. We're sending our children to school in Washington, D.C. - There's no reason we shouldn't be able to benefit the same way they do in Colorado .\" You walk into a D.C. public school, you see empty bookshelves, you seen underfunding, you see teachers going out and spending their money to buy kids supplies. We should be able to benefit the same way that other states do. \"The unveiling of the beer comes Tuesday night at Meridian Pint in the District's Columbia Heights neighborhood, where Initiative 71 supporters gathered on Election Night last year to celebrate legalization.

The Bush family ranks somewhere in the middle of the ranks of monied White House aspirants. However, Jeb Bush, as he is called, complicated things on this score when he spoke about the federal minimum wage during stops in South Carolina a few days ago. He is against it, as are most conservatives around the country. While Bush's comments are sure to warm the pocketbooks of right-wing Republicans who control the presidential primaries, this issue rubs particularly raw with some voters because Bush is a Catholic, a convert of 20 years. The Associated Press reported Bush said he can accept the present federal minimum wage, last raised in 2009, of $7.25 an hour, but opposes raising it. \"State minimum wages are fine,\" Bush said, according to the AP. The wage, he said, should be left to the states and the influences of the marketplace. As governor of Florida, Bush opposed a 2004 referendum approved by voters that tied the wage to inflation. In his South Carolina appearances, Bush implied that the minimum wage actually hurts employment opportunities for the poor. Unfortunately for Bush, these comments came as the New York Times published a lengthy story about how Bush is increasingly influenced by his Catholic faith. \"It's made me a better person,\" he told the Times. There is nothing in the catechism about the minimum wage. It is surely not an article of faith. Yet, the concept of government intervention on behalf of working men and women has been deeply embroidered into the literature and actions of the Catholic Church for the last 114 years. In reaction to the growth of Marxism in Europe, Pope Leo XIII published the papal encyclical \"Of New Things\" in 1891 in which he supported a living wage, and workers' rights to organize into labor unions. Leo's message swept through Catholic Western Europe. In America, it particularly influenced the struggling dioceses of Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo, where bishops fostered the creation of diocesan labor colleges to support unions and fair wages. In 1991, Pope <mark>John Paul</mark> II penned his own letter on economics, \"Our 100th Year,\" that took Leo's message further, stressing Christianity's \"preferential option for the poor .\" This is a fancy phrase calling for private and public intervention for the economic welfare of the poor and powerless. <mark>John Paul</mark> also warned that the economic boom of the 1990s was occurring \"over the heads\" of ordinary people, meaning the poor would be left out. Now it is Pope Francis who is warning about the spiritual and political dangers of the widening disparity of incomes. Of all the varied comments Francis has made about the church and society, his forebodings about rich and poor are his most consistent. According to the New Republic, Francis condemned \"the economics of exclusion\" in remarks before U.N. officials last May. Francis called for \"the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the state .\" He likened the economic \"throw away culture\" to the \"culture of death\" that allows abortion. All this makes tough sledding in swing states like Ohio and Florida for Bush, interested in becoming the second Catholic president. It was for Rep. <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>, R-Wis ., also a Catholic, as the GOP's vice presidential candidate in 2012. <mark>Ryan</mark> was attacked by Catholics for wanting to slash spending for social welfare.

According to a report by Wired, researchers at a digital security conference Friday revealed a difficult-to-detect BIOS attack called LightEater that leaves YouTube / hdgadget) When you turn on your computer, the BIOS - which stands for basic input/output system - helps your computer get going. It loads up your operating system - like Microsoft Windows - and helps the computer communicate with the stuff you've plugged into it: the display, the keyboard, the mouse, etc.. The hack works by infecting this basic input/output system. It's particularly worrisome because software designed to protect your computer from viruses doesn't typically scan the BIOS; it scans the operating system loaded by the BIOS. So if hackers can infect the BIOS, they are - in theory - capable of loading malware onto your system undetected. And here's the kicker, via Wired: \"The vulnerabilities...were so easy to find that they wrote a script to automate the process and eventually stopped counting [them] because there were too many .\" The problem is people aren't updating their BIOS when manufacturers make updates available.

Even the most conservative Republicans were starting to talk about this challenge in rather urgent terms. In a moment whose irony he noted, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told a bunch of rich Republicans gathered by the Brothers Koch earlier this year that those doing well in America were\" the top 1 percent, the millionaires and billionaires the president loves to demagogue, one or two of whom are here with us tonight \"while the\" people who have been hammered for the last six years are working men and women. \"And on it went through the country's top Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla ., stressed\" opportunity inequality \"and Mitt Romney, in another ironic turn, charged that\" under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer. \"It would be wonderful if conservatives really wanted to deal constructively with the predicament they so passionately describe. But thanks to the House and Senate GOP budgets, we now know that conservatives and Republicans (1) aren't serious about the plight of working class and lower income Americans, and (2) would actually make their situations much worse. Their spending plans fail even on conservative terms: They are not fiscally responsible. Instead, they rely on all sorts of magic tricks that shove choices and problems down the road. One heartening sign is that at least some conservatives find these budgets ridiculous. For example, James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute headlined his commentary for The Week:\" The disappointing unseriousness of the House GOP's budget. \"Pethokoukis wrote:\" House Republicans say they want to balance the federal budget and eventually eliminate the federal debt. They do not have a plan to do so. Oh, to be sure, they have a plan! Just not a realistic one that will actually accomplish their goals. \"He noted that of the $5.5 trillion in cuts from planned spending, $2 trillion would come from\" repealing the Obamacare insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion and replacing them with...well, nothing right now. \"The wholesale assault on efforts to provide lower income Americans with health insurance is the clearest sign that Republicans don't want to deal with inequality. The inability to get health insurance is one of the biggest burdens on low-income families, particularly those working for low wages and few or no benefits. Obamacare has helped 16.4 million Americans get health insurance. Where would they turn? And Republicans would compound the damage: The Senate proposes cutting an additional $400 billion from Medicaid over a decade, the House more than double that. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that on other low-income programs, the Senate budget cuts even more than the House. The vagueness of these plans makes it hard to tally how much damage would be done to food stamps, Pell Grants for low-income college students and the like, but Greenstein estimates that about two-thirds of the cuts in both plans come\" from programs for the less fortunate, thereby exacerbating poverty and inequality. \"Greenstein concludes that under such proposals-here's hoping President Obama is relentless in blocking them -\" ours would be a coarser and less humane nation with higher levels of poverty and inequality, less opportunity, \"and an\" inadequately prepared \"workforce. Another bit of hypocrisy: These budget writers care so much about national security that they're not willing to raise a dime in taxes to cover their sharp increases in defense spending. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, called out his conservative colleagues for how differently they treat defense and social spending .\" You're always telling us the deficit is so bad we've got to cut programs for the elderly, for the sick and for the poor, \"Sanders said,\" and suddenly, all of that rhetoric disappears. \"Budgets are, by their nature, boring. That's why those who assemble these long columns of numbers figure they can assail the well-being of the least privileged people in our society even as they profess to care about them so much. I'd respect these folks a lot more if they said what they clearly believe: They think more inequality would be good for us. It almost makes you nostalgic for the candor of the Romney who spoke about the\" 47 percent \"and the <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> who once divided us between\" makers \"and\" takers. \"Honesty beats saccharine words about the struggles of working people any day.
