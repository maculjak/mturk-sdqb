Opening a crucial day of debate in the House of Commons, Mrs <mark>May</mark> said MPs had made clear what they did not want when they rejected her Withdrawal Agreement by a 230-vote margin earlier this month, but now it was time for them to tell Brussels what they do want. She called for them to send an \"emphatic message\" to the EU by backing an amendment tabled by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady which would require her to replace the backstop with \"alternative arrangements\" to avoid a hard border in Ireland. And she told them: \"If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit.\" Despite what she acknowledged was a \"limited appetite\" in Europe for reopening talks, she insisted: \"I believe with a mandate from this House...I can secure such a change in advance of our departure from the EU.\" The amendment from Sir Graham--the chair of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee--was one of seven selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow for consideration and possible votes on Tuesday evening. Also up for debate is a cross-party proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles--backed by the Labour frontbench--which would hand control over the Brexit process to Parliament, potentially delaying departure day from March 29 to the end of the year. Mr Bercow also selected Jeremy Corbyn's own amendment--which would allow debate on Labour's preferred plan or a second referendum--as well as others which would rule out a no-deal Brexit, extend the two-year negotiation under Article 50 or permit a series of \"indicative votes\" to establish the will of the Commons. The Commons chamber was packed as the day's debate on Brexit began (PA) In an attempt to fend off possible rebellion by Tories seeking to avoid a no-deal departure, Mrs <mark>May</mark> promised that Tuesday's votes would not be MPs' final chance to pass judgment on EU withdrawal. She told the Commons she aims to return to the House \"as soon as possible\" with a revised deal, which will be subject to a \"meaningful vote\" of MPs. If defeated, she will table another amendable motion for debate the following day. If no new deal is reached by February 13, the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day. Mrs <mark>May</mark> acknowledged that the Commons defeat of the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with EU leaders last November had been \"decisive\" . And she told MPs: \"I listened.\" It was in the interests of the whole House to back the Brady amendment, which would resolve the main obstacle to Britain securing a smooth and orderly exit from the EU, she said. A cross-party amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper was selected for debate (PA) Mrs <mark>May</mark> said it was time for Parliament to \"speak as one\" . \"I will never stop battling for Britain, but the odds of success become much longer if this House ties one hand behind my back,\" she said. \"I call on this House to give me the mandate I need to deliver a deal this House can support.\" Do that and I can work to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Do that and I can fight for a backstop that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland in a way this House can support. Do that and we can leave the EU with a deal that honours the result of the referendum. \"So the time has come for words to be matched by deeds. If you want to tell Brussels what this House will accept, you have to vote for it. If you want to leave with a deal, you have to vote for it. If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit.\" She warned those considering voting for the \"cacophony\" of rival amendments to rule out no-deal: \"Unless we are to end up with no Brexit at all, the only way to avoid no-deal is to agree a deal.\" That is why I want to go back to Brussels with the clearest possible mandate to secure a deal that this House can support. That means sending the clearest possible message not about what this House does not want but what we do want. \"Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s hopes of securing a majority for the Brady amendment were boosted when former foreign secretary and Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson said he would\" gladly \"vote for it, if it meant legally binding changes to the backstop. We can't have some codicil or letter or joint declaration. We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country 2/2--Boris Johnson (@ BorisJohnson) January 29, 2019 But the chances of the Commons derailing her plans were also heightened when Labour confirmed it will back the Cooper-Boles plan. Mrs <mark>May</mark> is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening. Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, and Ireland's European affairs minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned:\" There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage. \"But Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s official spokesman said:\" There is a very clear message from the EU's leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK. \"(PA Graphics) Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs <mark>May</mark> on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment. But it was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the 118 Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s deal on January 15. Remain-backing Tories <mark>may</mark> rally behind the Cooper-Boles amendment, while other proposals <mark>may</mark> gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit. MPs rejected <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of 230 votes earlier this month (Mark Duffy/UK Parliament/PA) Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party. Drawn up in meetings co-ordinated by housing minister Kit Malthouse, the compromise recasts the backstop as a\" free trade agreement-lite \", with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border and an extended transition period to December 2021. DUP leader Arlene Foster--whose 10 MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration in the Commons--said it provided a\" feasible \"alternative to the backstop.\" If the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on, \"said Mrs Foster.

Stephen Waterson, 26, reversed the seat of his Audi convertible, squashing his girlfriend's young son in the footwell on February 1 last year. He then orchestrated a\" campaign of lies \", even threatening to make witnesses\" disappear \"to avoid responsibility for Alfie's death. The toddler's aunt, Ashleigh Jeffery, eventually broke the wall of silence and recorded Alfie's mother revealing what really happened. A jury had failed to reach a verdict in Waterson's trial and he pleaded guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in September ahead of his retrial. On Thursday, Mr Justice Kerr sentenced Waterson to seven-and-a-half years for manslaughter, plotting to pervert the course of justice and intimidating witness Marcus Lamb. The judge said:\" I do not find you were annoyed with Alfie and moved your seat back because of that annoyance. \"\"Nevertheless, I am satisfied so that I am sure on the evidence I heard at the trial that albeit not in anger but for your own comfort, you moved the car seat back twice and not only once.\" Stephen Waterson crushed three-year-old Alfie Lamb to death with his car seat (Metropolitan Police/PA) He accepted character references from the defendant's father, the former minister Nigel Waterson and his wife Barbara, who attended court, and agreed he was \"not all bad\" . But he said Waterson had been \"cunning, manipulative, dishonest, disloyal, deceitful, threatening, controlling and sometimes violent\" . Earlier this year, Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, 24, from Gravesend in Kent, was jailed for two years and nine months for child cruelty and her part in the conspiracy. Pregnant barmaid Emilie Williams, 20, had admitted lying to police and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 100 hours of unpaid work. On the cover-up, Mr Justice Kerr told Waterson: \"You orchestrated the campaign of lies, assisted by Ms Hoare who had the misfortune to fall in love with you and was willing to lie to protect you and herself.\" When the conspiracy began to falter in the second half of February 2018 under pressure from a very brave young woman, Ms Ashleigh Jeffery, you resorted to threats of violence, saying you could make people disappear. \"Alfie's mother Adrian Hoare was\" unlucky enough to fall in love' with Waterson and was caught up in the lies. (Met Police/PA) Speaking outside court, Ms Jeffery told how the family had been \"utterly devastated\" by the death of \"a very happy three-year-old boy with his whole life ahead of him\" . She said: \"The tragic circumstances surrounding his death is something we will never come to terms with.\" No sentence will ever be enough, but today we finally gave Alfie a voice and justice has prevailed. \"In a victim impact statement, she also said Waterson's guilty plea had been\" like a huge weight had been lifted \". Ms Jeffery, who had given key evidence in court, said:\" He could have avoided so much more upset in people's lives had he just owned up in the beginning. \"\"Justice has prevailed' Alfie's aunt Ashleigh Jeffery speaking outside the Old Bailey in London (Kirsty O\u2019Connor / PA) Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding described Waterson as a\" very arrogant, selfish, controlling and manipulative man \". He said:\" He knew what happened. He tried to put my officers off the scent from the word go. \"He paid tribute to Ms Jeffery, saying she had been\" incredibly strong and brave \"in her determination to find out what happened and\" changed the course of the investigation \". It is the first time anyone in the UK has died from crush asphyxiation as a result of an electronic car seat, police said. Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare with Alfie Lamb were caught on CCTV during a shopping trip to Sutton on the day he died (Metropolitan Police/PA) Waterson and Hoare had gone shopping for cushions in Sutton, south London, accompanied by Alfie, Williams, Marcus Lamb, 22, and another young child.

Thank you for your patience in this regard. - <mark>David McKay</mark> (editor) & team Vienna - Opec Gulf oil producers will not propose an output cut on Thursday, reducing the likelihood of joint action by Opec to prop up prices that have sunk by a third since June and raising the prospect of a global oil price war. \"The GCC reached a consensus,\" Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters, referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. \"We are very confident that Opec will have a unified position.\" \"The power of convincing will prevail tomorrow...I am confident that Opec is capable of taking a very unified position,\" Naimi added. A Gulf Opec delegate told Reuters the GCC had reached a consensus not to cut oil output. Three Opec delegates separately told Reuters they believed Opec was unlikely to cut output when the 12-member organisation meets on Thursday. The Opec meeting will be one of its most crucial in recent years, with oil having tumbled to below $78 a barrel due to the US shale boom and slower economic growth in China and Europe. Cutting output unilaterally would effectively mean for Opec, which accounts for a third of global oil output, a further loss of market share to North American shale oil producers. If Opec decided against cutting and rolled over existing output levels on Thursday, that would effectively mean a price war that the Saudis and other Gulf producers could withstand due to their large foreign-exchange reserves. Other members, such as Venezuela or Iran, would find it much more difficult. Brent crude was trading down 73 cents at $77.60 a barrel at 21:19. Naimi said earlier on Wednesday he expected the oil market \"to stabilise itself eventually\" , after talks with non-Opec member Russia on Tuesday yielded no pledge from Moscow to tackle a global oil glut jointly. The UAE sided with Naimi, saying oil prices would soon stabilise, while ramping up pressure on non-Opec nations. \"This is not a crisis that requires us to panic...we have seen (prices) way lower,\" UAE Oil Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told Reuters. \"The oversupply came from the evolution of the unconventional oil production...I think everyone needs to play a role in balancing the market, not Opec unilaterally,\" he said. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said some Opec members, although not Iran, were now gearing up for a battle over market share. \"Some Opec members believe that this is the time where we need to defend market share...All the experts in the market believe we have oversupply in the market and next year we will have more oversupply,\" he added. The group could opt to roll over output levels but stress the importance of better compliance, while also agreeing to hold an extraordinary meeting if prices keep falling, several Opec watchers have suggested. Price war Among the members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela and Iraq have called for output cuts. Opec's traditional price hawk Iran said on Wednesday its views were now close to those of Saudi Arabia. Zangeneh said there was unity inside Opec to \"monitor the market carefully\" but made no mention of a cut. \"The onslaught of North American shale oil has drastically undermined Opec's position and reduced its market share,\" said Dr <mark>Gary Ross</mark>, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group. Russia, which produces 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) or 11% of global oil, came to Tuesday's meeting amid hints it might agree to cut output as it suffers from oil's price fall and Western sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. But as that meeting with Naimi and officials from Venezuela and non-Opec member Mexico ended, Russia's most influential oil official, state firm Rosneft's head Igor Sechin, emerged with a surprise message - Russia will not reduce output even if oil falls to $60 per barrel. Sechin added that he expected low oil prices to do more damage to producing nations with higher costs, in a clear reference to the US shale boom. On Wednesday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he expected the country's output to be flat next year. Many at Opec were surprised by Sechin's suggestion that Russia - in desperate need of oil prices above $100 per barrel to balance its budget - was ready for a price war. \"Gulf states are less bothered about a price drop compared to other Opec members,\" an Opec source close to Gulf thinking said. Opec publications have shown that global supply will exceed demand by more than 1 million bpd in the first half of next year.
