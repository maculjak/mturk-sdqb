Born in Hong-Kong, Wang is singer, rapper, dancer and member of famous K-pop band Got7. He made his debut through the group's 2014 single \"Frozen in Time\". The band is popular for its hit songs like Fly, Hard, Girls Girls Girls, Stop Stop it, A and I Like You. JYP Entertainment took Jackson in 2011 when he signed the production house's talent program in the summer of the same year. He rose to stardom as a member of the boy group GOT7. The top winners of the night included Shawn Mendes (Best Artiste), Coldplay (Best Rock), Eminem (Best Hip Hop), Fifth Harmony (Best US Act) and Camilla Cabello (Best Pop). Moreover, kudos to Jackson on hitting another Jackpot, said one of his fans, who tweeted saying, \"look at this #mtvema impact jacks gained 10k followers on Instagram in one day akssjsjaja .\" look at this #mtvema impact jacks gained 10k followers on instagram in one day akssjsjaja pic.twitter.com/sJFXgzsGjx--londonson (@ sseunah) November 13, 2017 Check out GOT7 Jackson Wang speaking English at MTV EMA 2017: Related BTS members tweet in celebration of their official account crossing 10m followers on Twitter Picture of Song Joong ki, Song Hye Kyo showing off director <mark>John Woo</mark>'s wedding gift breaks internet From Song Hye Kyo to Park Shin Hye: Check out 6 naturally beautiful South Korean actresses without plastic surgery Kim Hee Sun, YoonA join Asia Artist Awards 2017 lineup Related BTS members tweet in celebration of their official account crossing 10m followers on Twitter Picture of Song Joong ki, Song Hye Kyo showing off director <mark>John Woo</mark>'s wedding gift breaks internet From Song Hye Kyo to Park Shin Hye: Check out 6 naturally beautiful South Korean actresses without plastic surgery Kim Hee Sun, YoonA join Asia Artist Awards 2017 lineup"}, {"articleID": "2016071114_01033293_W", "names": {"Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"], "David Cameron": ["Q1173911", "Q16195447", "Q18719363", "Q192", "Q47345547", "Q51808902", "Q5232111"], "Iain Mcnicol": ["Q29643248", "Q5980556"]}, "date": "2016-07-11", "url": "http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/AN_1468248204011689400/theresa-may-to-be-next-uk-pm-as-leadsom-bows-out.aspx", "content": "<mark>Theresa May</mark> To Be Next UK PM As Leadsom Bows Out VIENNA (Alliance News) - Britain is set to have a new female Prime Minister as Home Secretary...Alliance News 11 July, 2016 | 3:43 PM Share via Email Add Your Note (Optional): VIENNA (Alliance News) - Britain is set to have a new female Prime Minister as Home Secretary <mark>Theresa May</mark> is the only contender left in the Tory Leadership race, after Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom withdrew on Monday. Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee that oversees the election, said <mark>May</mark> was the only remaining candidate to become Tory leader. She will be confirmed as the new Conservative Party leader after consulting the board, Brady said. The contest will not re-open, he added. In a speech earlier on Monday, <mark>May</mark>, 59, a remain-campaigner, reiterated that there will not be a second referendum on EU membership. \"Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it\" , she said. In the June 23 referendum, 52% Britons voted to leave the EU in a surprise and historic move. It remains unclear whether the confirmation will come by the end of Monday or this week. After party confirmation, <mark>May</mark> must meet the Queen, who will return to London only tomorrow or Wednesday. <mark>May</mark> will likely meet the Queen during teatime. The final result of the Tory leadership election was set to be announced on September 9. Brady suggested that now it will not take that long for the announcement. While announcing his resignation in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote, Prime Minister <mark>David Cameron</mark> had said he will continue until October and that the exit talks with the EU should continue under the new PM. Reports suggest that <mark>Cameron</mark> will take his last Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, and hand over the role to <mark>May</mark> afterwards. <mark>May</mark> is a known face for the EU. In her campaign manifesto, she said the Article 50, which governs the EU exit process, will not be triggered this year. She has also ruled out a general election before 2020 and abandoned the target of achieving a budget surplus by that year. Her stance on the status of EU nationals living in the UK has attracted criticism. She has only said that they will be part of the \"Brexit\" negotiations, refusing to guarantee that they can remain in the country. Earlier on Monday, Leadsom bowed out from the race, saying she lacked \"sufficient support to lead a strong and stable government\". She had less than 25% backing of MPs. She also said that it was in the interests of the country that a new strong PM is appointed immediately. \"A nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable,\" she said. With over 60% of Tory MPs' backing, <mark>May</mark> is \"ideally placed to implement\" Brexit \"on the best possible terms for the British people and she has promised that she will do so\" , the energy minister said. Leadsom's withdrawal came after she faced severe criticism for her comments in an interview in the Times last week, which implied that being a mother gave her a \"real stake\" in Britain's future. <mark>May</mark> is childless and Leadsom texted an apology to her on Monday, reports said. Responding to Leadsom's withdrawal, <mark>May</mark>'s campaign manager Chris Gayling said her statement showed she is a \"true public servant\" and a decent person. <mark>May</mark> is set to make a statement later on Monday. Prominent \"Leave\" campaigner Boris Johnson called for quick transition of the PM role to <mark>May</mark>. The former London mayor had quit the Tory leadership bid after his close ally Michael Gove launched a surprise bid. Gove, who was eliminated from the race last week, also sought a quick handover of the leadership to <mark>May</mark>. Following the Tory news, Labour called for a general election. \"It is crucial, given the instability caused by the Brexit vote, that the country has a democratically elected prime minister,\" Labour's Election Coordinator Jon Trickett said. \"It is time for the Labour party to unite and ensure the millions of people in the country left behind by the Tories' failed economic policies, have the opportunity to elect a Labour government .\" However, unity in the Labour party seems a distant prospect for now. Leadsom's announcement coincided with Labour MP Angela Eagle's launch of her bid for the Labour Party leadership. \"These are dark times for Labour,\" Eagle said in a statement announcing her formal challenge to Jeremy Corbyn leadership. \"And they are dangerous times for our country .\" Corbyn had publicly declared that he will remain as the Labour Party leader \"come what <mark>may</mark>\" , allowing crucial talks with unions to find a solution to the crisis fall apart. \"Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership this huge task needs,\" Eagle said. \"I believe I can .\" Labour Party General Secretary <mark>Iain McNicol</mark> confirmed that there will be a contest for the leadership position. Like the Conservatives, the main UK opposition party has also witnessed chaos after the surprise \"Brexit\" vote. Several members of the shadow cabinet, including Eagle, quit in a revolt against Corbyn leadership. The crisis also led to a no-confidence move against Corbyn that he lost. Eagle, 55, has been the MP for Wallasey. She is openly gay and has championed social causes such as smoking bans, hunting ban and same sex marriages. She had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU.

BHP Billiton Ltd cut its 2018 fiscal year iron ore output guidance on Thursday citing issues in its railroad car unloading system, while reporting an 8 percent rise in third-quarter iron ore production. The miner cut its fiscal 2018 production guidance to between 272-274 million tonnes of iron ore from 275-280 million tonnes. It also narrowed its full-year copper guidance to 1.70-1 .785 million tonnes from the earlier range of 1.655-1 .790 million tonnes. BHP, the world's biggest miner, said its copper production target was affected by a \"slower than planned\" ramp-up in production during the March quarter at its Olympic Dam facility in South Australia.

Business-minded youngsters from Scoil na Tr\u00edon\u00f3ide in Doon and Desmond College in Newcastle West will travel to the capital after being named the most enterprising students in Co Limerick. They will join 300 other students from around the countries at the April 22 showpiece. Students from Desmond College impressed judges of the Limerick Student Enterprise Awards with their project \"Guide a Key'. This is a device which aids people with limited dexterity inserting their key into a lock. It is affixed onto the area around the keyhole, and the user then simply slides their key into the top part of the keyhole. Another Desmond College student, Emily Duffy, 15, will travel to Dublin after winning the first prize in the intermediate category for her product, the imaginatively named\" Duffily Wrap'. Made with metallic bubble wrap, and aluminium, the sleeping-bag inspired product is designed to help the homeless. Emily started working on the idea when she took part in a fundraiser for the Novas Initiatives charity last year. And three best friends from Scoil na Tr\u00edon\u00f3ide will complete Limerick's delegation in Dublin. Jayne Ryan, Lisa Meehan and Aoife Ryan, all 13, approached a number of companies in Limerick including Subway, Diesel, New Look and Wacky Shoes to offer discounts through a special card for second level students.

Mr Wang fled to Australia to seek asylum and assist the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The Chinese government dismissed his claims as false and said he was a convicted criminal, while ASIO director-general <mark>Mike Burgess</mark> issued a rare statement saying his agency took claims of foreign interference seriously. On Thursday, The Age and the Herald revealed that Mr Wang was warned on Christmas Eve and the following days that he could be sent back to China and killed unless he publicly retracted his story and read from a script prepared by a Chinese businessman working together with a senior operative from Taiwan's Kuomintang opposition party, Deputy Secretary-General Alex Tsai. Mr Tsai, who is being investigated by the federal police over his role in the plot, held a press conference on Thursday morning where he denied having threatened Mr Wang. He also denied being involved in the attempt to have Mr Wang falsely implicate the ruling DPP in bribery, instead repeating the allegations the DPP was involved in misconduct. Messages between Alex Tsai (wearing a business suit) and Mr Sun (wearing a hat). And several of Mr Tsai's denials about his involvement in a potentially illegal plot appear to be inconsistent with messages he sent the second man being investigating over the Christmas Eve plot, a Chinese businessman called Mr Sun. In messages obtained by The Age and the Herald, Mr Tsai sent Mr Sun three guarantees that he allegedly agreed to offer Mr Wang if he followed Mr Tsai's directives. Another message between Mr Tsai and Mr Sun. They include promises that the Chinese Communist Party would assist Mr Wang and cease harassing him. While Mr Tsai has also denied having offered financial inducements to Mr Wang, the messages show that he also promised to organise the repayment of any debts held by Mr Wang. In another message, Mr Tsai appears to ask Mr Sun to urge Mr Wang to issue a statement in return for a benefit: \"Please have Wang Liqiang record a video\" , in return for which the Kuomintang would allow him to freely settle in Taiwan. Shortly after these promises were made, Mr Wang was sent a script in which he recants his original claims and states he was paid by the DPP to fabricate them. Other messages show Mr Sun telling Wang Liqiang he was acting on behalf of Mr Tsai's Kuomintang party. Mr Tsai also sent Mr Wang photos of himself with China's President Xi Jinping in what appears to be an attempt to demonstrate his close connections to the Chinese Communist Party. Other messages show the Chinese businessman Mr Sun telling Mr Wang that he was acting on behalf of Mr Tsai's Kuomintang party. \"All your problems will be resolved by the Kuomintang,\" reads one message from the businessman. The AFP is treating seriously the alleged threats and inducements directed at Mr Wang, with sources confirming they opened an investigation in the hours after the first message was received by Mr Wang on Christmas Eve. \"The Australian Federal Police is aware of threats made against a man currently residing in Australia,\" a spokesman said on Wednesday. \"The AFP takes threats of this nature seriously and has commenced an investigation .\" Loading Mr Wang's November television interview sparked a political firestorm in Taiwan. The Chinese government is seeking to unify Taiwan with the mainland despite overwhelming opposition to reunification among Taiwanese citizens, and Chinese influence in Taiwan has become a key political issue."}, {"articleID": "2019102320_00044498_W", "names": {"Francis Collins": ["Q20740726", "Q336658"]}, "date": "2019-10-23", "url": "https://www.voanews.com/science-health/us-gates-foundation-plan-200m-sickle-cell-hiv-cures", "content": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Print this page Comments Science & Health US, Gates Foundation Plan $200M for Sickle Cell, HIV Cures By Agence France-Presse October 23, 2019 03:29 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Print this page Comments FILE - Bill and Melinda Gates are interviewed in Kirkland, Washington, Feb. 1, 2019. The philantropist couple has teamed up with the U.S. government to more forcefully tackle HIV and sickle cell disease. WASHINGTON - The U.S. government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledged Wednesday to jointly invest $200 million over the next four years to achieve affordable gene therapy-based cures for sickle cell disease (SCD) and HIV. The administration of President Donald Trump announced earlier this year its intention to end the HIV epidemic over the next decade and has also identified SCD, which disproportionately affects people of African descent, as a condition requiring greater attention. Gene therapy is a relatively new area of medicine designed to replace faulty genes in the body that are responsible for a disorder, and has been responsible for new treatments for blindness and certain types of leukemia. But the treatments are complex and costly, ruling them out as an option for most of the world. <mark>Francis Collins</mark>, director of the National Institutes of Health, said the collaboration would focus therefore on \"access, scalability and affordability\" to make sure the eventual treatments are available globally. The NIH and Gates Foundation aim to achieve clinical trials in the United States and countries in sub-Saharan Africa within the next seven to 10 years. Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders characterized by the presence of an abnormal protein in the red blood cells, causing the feet and hands to swell, fatigue, jaundice, and episodic or chronic pain. Over time the disease can harm a patients' vital organs, bones, joints and skin and it is currently only curable via a blood and bone marrow transplant, available to only a tiny fraction of people who have the disease. When it comes to HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) are now able to reduce patients' viral load to the point that they are undetectable and cannot be further transmitted. But \"a major goal is to find a cure, whereby lifelong ART would not be required,\" said the NIH's Anthony Fauci. Though SCD is a genetically inherited disease, and HIV is acquired from infection, gene-based treatments are said to hold promise for both, and \"many of the technical challenges for gene-based cures are expected to be common to both diseases .\" The goal for SCD is to achieve a gene-based intervention that either corrects the gene mutation responsible or promotes fetal hemoglobin gene expression to achieve normal hemoglobin function. For HIV, the proposed cure would involve targeting the reservoir of proviral DNA that lurks inside a small number of cells even after many years of ART. The NIH said that approximately 95 percent of the 38 million people living with HIV globally are in the developing world, with 67 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, half of whom are living untreated. Around 1.1 million Americans are affected SCD affects approximately 100,000 Americans, according to official figures. Fifteen million babies will be born with SCD globally over the next 30 years, with about 75 percent of those births occurring in sub-Saharan Africans, said the NIH. Written By Agence France-Presse"}]
