pictured here on thursday, april 21, 2011, will be handed over to marshall university by the end of february 2012. huntington--the veterans memorial field house's days officially were numbered wednesday night after the greater huntington park and recreation district board unanimously voted on a deal that would put the property in the sole possession of marshall university by the end of february 2012. after months of negotiations, park and university officials reached a deal earlier this month that will allow for the transfer of the property from the district to marshall for a planned soccer stadium complex, which also will include a public park. part of the deal requires that any structure constructed on the property, regardless of ownership, will include \"veterans memorial\" in the title, which will be accompanied by appropriate signage. any other naming rights or sponsorships will be prohibited from being displayed more prominently than the \"veterans memorial\" sign. the deal also includes $100,000 from marshall to the district to create a half-acre neighborhood park on the site that also would commemorate veterans. the park, which will be named \"veterans memorial park,\" will include a playground, a picnic shelter and an american flag-themed rock-climbing wall. many of the deal's details involve making a notable dedication to veterans, which always was the goal of the field house said ken wolfe, president of the park district. \"the number one thing in all of this was for us to be able to continue to honor the veterans,\" wolfe said. \"we were never concerned that we would lose that, and this will even be sort of an upgrade in how we honor them and pay tribute to them by taking a deteriorating structure they used and providing a brand new facility that will still be named for them and available for their use .\" one of the details of the deal simply states that \"marshall university will make the new facility for available for community use,\" and that the university will be responsible for \"satisfying any and all claims that other entities, including the cabell county board of education, may have on the property .\" the park district will honor its commitments through february 29, 2012, which include the st. joe invitational basketball tournament, which will be one of the final events to take place in the field house. a veterans memorial field house grand finale basketball game is planned for saturday, feb. 11, 2012 and will be the very last event at the field house before it is transferred to marshall. the proceeds from the finale will be split 50-50 between the park district and marshall as will the proceeds from a salvage sale featuring items including chairs and the basketball flooring that will take place at a later date. in the past decade, the park district has spent more than $520,000 to support revenue losses at the field house, but the board was not looking to sell the property when marshall officials approached them this past spring. marshall plans to spend approximately $5.4 million through a bond issue to demolish the field house and build a soccer stadium complex that would include a turf field, seating, locker room facilities and lighting. the field house has a leaking roof, which has been patched numerous times, and, when the board was approached about the deal, they were looking into repairs that would have cost between $940,000 and $1.4 million. wolfe said there was \"no reasonable likelihood\" that the district would ever be able to obtain funds to replace the roof. jason aldean \"my kinda party\" tour 2011 7:30 p.m. saturday, oct. 1. featuring special guests <mark>chris young</mark> and thompson square. tickets, visit \"pickin' at the
