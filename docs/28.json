been disciplined after an investigation into their handling of a may 30 traffic stop. the city cited personnel concerns in declining to release details of the probe. but mayor <mark>jim moore</mark>, city administrator j.d. kehrman and police chief don wickenhauser confirmed the results to the courier-post. kehrman said \"internal action\" had been taken and that the two officers were still employed by the city. \"we think appropriate action has been taken,\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"we looked at the matters we felt needed to be looked at .\" \"the main goal here was to review and see whether action needed to be taken,\" kehrman said. \"i think (the probe) should yield some positive results .\" kehrman said the inquiry looked at whether the two officers' \"actions were consistent with policies of the police department .\" national attention bowling green drew national attention for the may 30 traffic stop. part-time officer brian czarnecki pulled over mayor david koester for speeding at 10:16 p.m. at the south edge of bowling green. the first-year officer reported koester appeared to be drunk, had an open beer bottle in his car and apparently had no valid proof of insurance. a recording captured the 15:55 conversation between czarnecki, koester and backup officer sgt. russ schaible. czarnecki asked koester if he'd been drinking and koester replied that he'd \"had a couple of beers .\" czarnecki, however, gave conflicting reports about koester's status. in his written statement, the officer said koester's \"eyes were glassy and watery, and his speech was slurred .\" but in a conversation with schaible, czarnecki said he believed koester \"could pass a sobriety\" check. also on the tape, koester's speech does not sound slurred. he did ask czarnecki if the officer knew who he was. \"i'm the mayor of bowling green,\" koester said. in a later interview, koester said that the question was a means of introduction and was not an effort to seek leniency. the tape of the traffic stop backs koester up, because he never again raised the issue. on the tape, the two officers can be heard discussing how to proceed. they talked about letting koester drive home. schaible says \"hope he doesn't crash .\" at one point, schaible asks \"anybody else, you'd write a ticket, wouldn't you?\" after several minutes, czarnecki returned to koester's car and asked the mayor if anyone could come pick him up. koester called his wife, sherry, who drove to the scene. \"it should be noted mr. koester stumbled when he exited his vehicle and staggered when he walked to his wife's vehicle,\" czarnecki later wrote in his report. while the written report says koester was given \"verbal warnings on multiple traffic/ordinance violations,\" the tape appears to have captured only the warning about speeding. koester consistently maintained that he was not drunk. koester supporters point to the fact that he was never charged with a crime and said he was unfairly targeted. opponents of the controversial mayor claimed he got preferential treatment when czarnecki issued only a verbal warning. kehrman called for an investigation on june 9. on june 16, just hours before an expected board of aldermen vote on his removal, koester resigned the $500-a-month job he won by 10 votes in april 2008. <mark>moore</mark>, the aldermanic president and a former prison superintendent, was sworn into office. one other stop records show that bowlng green police made at least one other traffic stop the evening of may 30. it happened at 9:23 p.m. in almost the exact spot where koester was pulled over. schaible wrote three tickets for traffic offenses to a frankford woman. kehrman said the 9:23 p.m. stop was not part of the investigation because \"it was the (officers') actions surrounding\" the stop of koester and the accusations of leniency for a city official that prompted concern. \"we thought it needed to be reviewed,\" kehrman said. \"the issue of other stops that night didn't really factor into the investigation .\" the city originally asked the missouri highway patrol to conduct the probe, but the agency called the case an internal matter. wickenhauser, who has more than three decades of police experience, was asked to handle the case. by doing so, the city had no cash expense .'...move forward' kehrman said police policies are being reviewed to see if changes are needed. specific policy revisions would need aldermanic approval before being enacted. \"the challenge is to ensure that something good comes from this,\" kehrman said. \"anything we can do to improve service to the community is a positive thing. hopefully, that has been accomplished here .\" <mark>moore</mark> and wickenhauser also are ready to put the matter to rest. \"we're ready to move forward,\" wickenhauser said. \"we are going to go forward from this and we're going to do the very best job we can .\" ", "articleID": "2009070622_00058225_W", "names":

scottish jig\" on the 18th green after another long putt fell into the cup. play on. about an hour later, tiger woods tapped in for a par that didn't mean a thing. time to call it a day. talk about role reversal. <mark>watson</mark>, the 59-year-old former british open champion, was supposed to be going through the motions, taking his penultimate curtain call at a tournament that holds such a special place in his career. instead, he heads to the weekend with a share of the lead, having put together two magical rounds and needing two more to get his hands on the claret jug for a record-tying sixth time. woods, the world's best player and right in his prime, was supposed to be homing in on a 15th major championship, another step closer to jack nicklaus' record 18. instead, woods missed the cut, hopped his private jet to florida, and gave his personal chef a few unexpected days off. these were two turnberry shockers. \"it's as if the spirits are on my side,\" said <mark>watson</mark>, who made history friday afternoon as the oldest player to lead a major championship, tying open rookie <mark>steve marino</mark> with a 5-under 135. woods must have felt like everything was stacked against him, because he's sure not used to failing. this was only the second time in 49 major championships as a pro that he failed to make it to the weekend. \"kept making mistake after mistake,\" woods said. now comes a weekend alive with possibilities, just none of them involving woods. the early starters saturday played in pleasant, partly cloudy weather, though that persistent breeze along the scottish coast toughened things up. just ask two-time champion padraig harrington, whose hopes of winning a third straight open faded away with a 6-over score through 16 holes. but american bryce moulder showed a low number was possible, posting an early 3-under 67. <mark>watson</mark> will take aim at harry vardon and his six british open titles. one shot behind was 49-year-old mark calcavecchia, who won the open 20 years ago up the coast at royal troon. he, too, survived the stretch of holes along the firth of clyde in a stiff wind that demanded so much of every shot. calcavecchia made a 40-foot birdie putt on the 10th that carried him to a 69. two-time u.s. open champion retief goosen twice saved par from 35 feet and had a 70, putting him in the group at 3-under 137 that included three-time major champion <mark>vijay singh</mark>. thirteen players were within three shots of the lead, while <mark>sergio garcia</mark> (139) and <mark>john daly</mark> (140) were both in striking distance. \"i guess the memories are with me, all the wonderful memories i've had playing links golf,\" <mark>watson</mark> said. \"walking down the fairways, walking up onto the greens, people showing their respect for me, showing my respect for them. and it's been since 1975-34 years i've played links golf. and it's a fabric of my life, i can tell you that .\" woods failed to make the cut for only the sixth time in his career, and the first since the 2006 u.s. open at winged foot, his first tournament after his father died. \"everybody's entitled to a bad day,\" said lee westwood, who played with woods and shot 70 to join the group at 138. \"it was tough conditions out there, and the wind can play havoc with your swing sometimes. and he hit a couple of poor shots at the wrong time .\" <mark>watson</mark> finished with a pair of birdie putts that were nearly as long as his odds of winning another claret jug. there was a 75-footer footer from the back on the 16th green, then a 45-footer at no. 18 to cap an even-par 70 that might have been more impressive than his bogey-free 65 on thursday. this time, he had to bounce back after making five bogeys in six holes, four of them in a row. \"i wouldn't be here if i didn't think i could win,\" <mark>watson</mark> said. woods always thinks he can win, but his performance on the back nine was abysmal. he hit one tee shot that was never found in the high grass along the dunes right of the 10th fairway. he hit into a fairway bunker for the first time all week. it took him two shots to get up a bank and onto the green at the 13th. woods dropped seven shots during a wretched six-hole stretch, and not even two late birdies could spare him the indignation of missing the cut. needing to chip in for birdie on the 18th hole, he came up a few feet short and tapped in for a 74 and 145 total, one shot off the cut. \"i kept compounding my problems out there,\" woods said. <mark>watson</mark> was tied for the lead with <mark>marino</mark>, a 29-year-old american who didn't know until last weekend that he had gotten into the british open as an alternate, and then had to fly his father from virginia to his home in florida to fetch <mark>marino</mark>'s passport. \"i wasn't even expecting to play in this tournament,\" <mark>marino</mark> said. one year after greg norman made a stunning bid to win the british open at 53, the prospects of <mark>watson</mark> winning at 59 are staggering. the oldest major champion was julius boros, who was 48 when he captured the 1968 pga championship. <mark>watson</mark> won his first of his five british opens at carnoustie in 1975, five months before woods was born. now <mark>watson</mark> is trying to win another-and he doesn't have to worry about woods getting in the way. ann coulter on top victim status: \"being black trumps being an insect' to liberals", "articleID": "2009071812_00075034_W", "names": {"John Daly": ["Q203831",
