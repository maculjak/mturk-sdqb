Memphis upset Navy 30-27. (AP Photo/Mark <mark>Humphrey</mark>) <mark>Mark Humphrey</mark> Marshall's Kaare Vedvik knew he hit a good punt out of his own end zone. Once the ball landed, it kept going and going, farther than any other punt in a Football Bowl Subdivision game in 45 years. His 92-yard punt against Old Dominion on Saturday was, according to Marshall research, the longest since Southern Mississippi's <mark>Ray Guy</mark> boomed a 93-yarder against Mississippi in 1972. \"It's an unbelievable feeling to send it from one end zone to the other,\" the redshirt senior from Norway said. \"It's a punter's dream. Every time, you just try to hit your best ball. This one went over his head and had a nice tail wind. The ball rolled down to the other goal line, so you can't ask for anything better than that .\" \u00d7 Vedvik's big punt came after the Thundering Herd went three plays and out on their first possession of the game. With the ball at the 8-yard line, Vedvik was deep in his own end zone and with a light wind at his back when he put his foot to the ball. It bounced at the Old Domion 30, over the return man, and skipped hard toward the end zone and rolled in before the coverage team could down it. Vedvik also had punts of 52, 36, 48 and 36 yards as well as a pooch punt of 27 in the Herd's 35-3 win. His season average of 44.8 yards leads Conference USA. The longest punt in FBS history: 99 yards by Nevada's <mark>Pat Brady</mark> against Loyola Marymount in 1950. Some other notable feats from the weekend:------LEG WORKOUT Kansas' Cole Moos established a national season high with 13 punts against Iowa State. No other punter in the FBS has attempted more than 11 in a game this season. Moos' 40 punts are most in the Big 12 by far. NAVY GOES BY LAND Navy leads the nation with 397.5 yards rushing per game, and the Midshipmen are on pace to pile up the most yards on the ground since Nebraska's 1995 national championship team averaged 399.8. Quarterback Zach Abey is running for 169.3 yards per game, 29 behind national leader Bryce Love of Stanford. Abey's 189 carries are tied for most in the country. The Midshipmen also get nearly 70 yards a game from both <mark>Malcolm Perry</mark> and Chris High. THE 200 CLUB Boston College freshman AJ Dillion had the top rushing performance of the weekend, running for 272 yards and four touchdowns on 39 carries in a 45-42 win over Louisville. It was the third-best outing by a BC back behind <mark>Andre Williams</mark>' 339 yards against North Carolina State and 295 yards against New Mexico State, both in 2013. Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate, after going for 327 yards against Colorado a week earlier, ran 15 times for 230 yards against UCLA. Wisconsin freshman <mark>Jonathan Taylor</mark> had his second straight 200-yard game, going for 219 on 30 carries against Purdue. Diocemy Saint Juste of Hawaii ran 39 times for 202 yards against San Jose State, his third 200-yard game of the season. FANTASTIC FALCON Air Force quarterback Arion Worthman became the fifth player this season to score five touchdowns in a game. Worthman finished with 166 yards and scored four of his touchdowns in the second half as the Falcons came back from a 27-point deficit to beat UNLV 34-30. Worthman's fifth TD, a 1-yard run with 2:14 left, gave the Falcons their first lead. PASSING LEADER Oklahoma State's <mark>Mason Rudolph</mark> and UCLA's Josh Rosen are in a close competition for most passing yards per game. <mark>Rudolph</mark> overtook Rosen this week after throwing for 459 yards against Baylor to raise his average to 394.7. Rosen had a season-low 219 yards against Arizona, dropping his average from 427 to 392.3 .------More AP college football: http: //collegefootball.ap.org and https: //www.twitter.com/AP--Top25 Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

This legislation passed on the heels of a similar Senate bill that passed just weeks before on September 28. The NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act (H.R. 2105) would require the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to issue voluntary guidelines specifically addressing the needs of the many small businesses across the country. Much like other voluntary guidelines enacted by NIST, the guidance for small business would not seek to add additional regulation, but rather would provide small business owners with a set of best practices to keep themselves safe in the constantly growing cyber world. According to the bill, small businesses account \"for 54 percent of all United States sales and 55 percent of jobs in the United States .\" Not only do attacks targeting small and medium businesses account for a high percentage of cyberattacks in the United States, according to the National Cyber Security Alliance, but \"[s] ixty percent of small businesses that suffer a cyberattack are out of business within 6 months .\" House sponsor <mark>Daniel Webster</mark> (R-Fla .), an owner of a multi-generational small business, stated that small businesses \"are more susceptible to attacks\" because of the limited cybersecurity resources and the \"tools they need to prepare for such an event .\" (via Bloomberg BNA .) According to <mark>Webster</mark>, the NIST cybersecurity framework would act to \"protect business owners, their employees, and their customer base, all while contributing positively to the economy .\" H.R. 2105 received bipartisan support and passed by a voice vote. The similar Senate bill, the MAIN STREET Cybersecurity Act (S. 770), also received bipartisan support.

See related Rugby in crisis: potential strike amid injury and mental health fears Gatland's Law--or as WalesOnline puts it, the WRU Senior Players Selection Policy--was introduced by head coach Warren Gatland to keep Test stars playing in Wales and bar them from international Test matches if they played outside Wales. WalesOnline says the law states that\" only players who play in Wales will be eligible for selection to the national squad \". These rules changed today. Under the new system, stars playing outside Wales will only be available for international selection if they have won 60 caps or more. The rule change does not apply to players with less than 60 caps if they are already playing outside Wales. One player who will be hit by the rule change is British & Irish Lions star <mark>Webb</mark>, who will join French side Toulon next season. Because he has won only 28 caps he will now miss out on Wales selection.

He's currently on 56 appearances, but with a move to Northampton lined up next season he would need another four caps to remain in contention. When asked about the change, WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips told ITV Sport:\" Whatever contract that a player is in today, that contract is protected. When that contract expires and if the player has less than 60 caps, they would not be eligible for selection. \"If they have 60 or more caps and they are outside Wales they would be .\" He says the existing policy didn't work well enough and was \"quite complicated\". The aim, he says, is to make it simpler. \"We have tried to step back and say:\" let's try to simplify this' make it understandable for players, for supporters and try and give each of the five entities [four regions and Wales] access to the players they need. \"Wales head coach Gatland said:\" For me as a national coach, if I was being perfectly selfish, would I have a policy? No I wouldn't. It is not about me or the national team, it is about what is the best thing for Welsh rugby? He says the best thing is to try and keep the best players in Wales for \"as long as we possibly can\". While being aware of pressure from market forces, he says the new policy is \"pretty much black and white\". On social media some Wales supporters are furious about a rule change that will see their \"best player\" <mark>Webb</mark> miss out on selection. Sandra Loy called it a \"big decision\" by the WRU.

Weinstein and his brother founded Miramax which has been responsible for successful films such as Pulp Fiction and Good Will Hunting. He has received numerous awards for his work and has been active in issues such as AIDS and Juvenile Diabetes. He was, undoubtedly, a Hollywood powerhouse who had the connections to make or break careers. Sexual assault is rampant around the world and I have long been an active voice speaking out against it and advocating for the victims. I am in no way minimizing what any woman suffers in my comments regarding this particular case but I have some serious concerns and I think they are concerns that should be shared. Lately, there has been a whole stream of public figures who stand accused of various sexual assaults. Some are hopeful that this signals a new willingness to expose these atrocities and that they represent our commitment to draw a line in the sand and say \"No more .\" We seem to circumvent the who legal process meant to determine guilt and jump straight to judgement. Guilt appears to be amplified by the public lives of the accused. Is it easier for us to comment on a life that we already feel we have a right to because we see them in our own homes on our media devices and on the news? It appears to at least polarize the accusers as legitimate and the accused as guilty. No-one seems to worry about questioning what we read and hear. A trial and its outcome are irrelevant. As long as you have Gloria Allred on one side of the microphone, the truth is irrelevant. The story never dies and the accused, even if innocent, will never completely recover. Take away the celebrity cases and looking to regular court in your own cities and communities and you will find a whole slew of sexual abuse allegations being made against, mainly men. In family court, those allegations are too frequently proven to be wrong or without substance. The man stands accused and those who are willing to lie in order to punish or hurt, or even sometimes to gain financial reward, are suddenly in the driver's seat. They have a story with elaborately made up facts. The accused now has to prove a negative. They have to prove that they did not abuse the \"pretend victim .\" These pretend victims are believed and supported BECAUSE there are real victims somewhere and their suffering is real. These false accusers, who themselves should be punished to the full extent of the law, use the very real stories of legitimate victims to further their lies. No-one should be championing these women. No-one should be supporting them. THEY make it harder for the real victims because once these liars are found out, they make it harder for real victims to come forward. They make it harder for people to believe them and they make it less likely that they will ever find justice, safety or peace. Isn't this the real foundation of all women's rights? We will no longer allow ourselves to be abused? We will stand up and speak out and we demand justice? Violence against women, especially sexual violence MUST end? Then WHY are women using the abuse of women as a weapon to \"get even\" or to \"make someone pay?\" Now amplify the accusation to the public arena and you have people possibly motivated for the same reasons but more. Now there is a quality of blackmail in taking it public. You and I probably do not care what is happening in a city on the other side of our countries where \"John Citizen\" has just been accused but we are possibly going to weigh in on \"John Celebrity .\" These people also are involved in issues, they speak out. They can expose people and their business practices. They may know about political issues and personalities. They may have done something to anger the wrong people or not done what they were supposed to do. The accusations made against <mark>Donald Trump</mark> during the last election are a perfect example. All of a sudden the man is accused of several instances of sexual abuse and yet none of them seem to have followed through and he was never found guilty or even charged. It seems like it all might just have been part of an attempt to keep him from being elected. Despite there being no real proof, many people still believe it as if there had been a conviction. All I am saying is there are plenty of reasons for people to stand up and make accusations without them ever being true. The \"pretend victims\" are using the accusation of sexual abuse for personal gain. I have heard some people insist there are too many women coming forward for Weinstein's charges to not be true. I hear people swayed by the star quality of some of the accusers. The bigger the star the more we seem willing to believe in their moral integrity, even when there is no evidence of a star having any morals or integrity. Is Weinstein guilty? I have no idea. Just because I state that I am not loading up my own supply of stones to throw does not mean I am supporting him or that I believe he is innocent. It means I don't know. None of us can say that we do. But here is where I am most uneasy. I see these women, huge stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie and well-known stars like Rose McGowan and Ashely Judd, coming forward. According to Entertainment Weekly, there are more than 40 women to date. There are others who have not claimed abuse but who say they knew, like Jane Fonda. Many of these women are role models, active in various Women's groups. Some of them are considered role models for the other actresses. None of them spoke out? None of them. Not the abused, not the ones who heard about it, not the ones who saw it. This is reported to have been going on for years. They were abused and then they were silent. They did not seek help. They did not seek justice. They did not stand up and use their positions of leadership among women to speak the truth of their own experience and lead by example. I find myself asking why. The only answer is that ultimately, they all chose their careers overcoming forward. If they said anything, they would never work again because Weinstein was that powerful. I accept that it might have been incredibly painful. I accept that they may have been that damaged. But then, I have to ask, why did they stay? Why continue to work in an industry that operates on that level, with people who see and know and say nothing? Why risk further abuse in an industry with a man so powerful that he had great influence over their careers? They stayed and continued to work and accept the money, and uphold the image and the fa\u00e7ade of Hollywood. They played the game. They were part of it. In making their choice they spit in the face of all the other victims which many of them heard about and talked with over the years. They did not protect them. They spit in the face of all the women who struggle to come forward in their own lives because the very real consequences of doing that might mean the loss of their families, and even worse violence, possibly death. The fame of many of these women offered them a protection that the average woman does not have. Their fame offered them a voice that could have saved many by identifying their abuser who, by their accounts, was growing bolder, but also by setting an example for other women to follow. Instead, Ashley Judd stood and insisted she was a \"nasty woman\" and assured all women they should be like her and fight against all these injustices. She was happy to hurl accusations at <mark>Trump</mark> when again, she had no personal knowledge as to whether any of those accusations were true, but the one truth she could have spoken with complete confidence went unspoken. She was willing to destroy someone else's life based on a possible lie but she was not willing to stand up for her own truth. I am sure there are many sexual predators in Hollywood, of course, there are, they are a group of people like any other group of people. Our world is filled with both violence and sexual depravity. Predators exist in practically every group you can name. The disregard for one another, the disrespect, the hate, is not about being black, or Muslim, or a woman, it is just the way many people now see the world. We are so bolstered in our sense of entitlement, our \"rights,\" that we now see other people as just tools that we can use and abuse as our whims and appetites might direct us. And while the predators should be exposed and stand to face their crimes, there are many other who should stand with them. In order for them to continue and to feed the appetites of the predator, there has to be a huge crowd of the people that know what is going on and do nothing. Sadly, in this case, that crowd included his victims. Hollywood has no-one to blame for the decay that I believe is going to destroy all of them, but themselves. \"Some people think they can find satisfaction in good food, fine clothes, lively music, and sexual pleasure. However, when they have all these things, they are not satisfied. They realize happiness is not simply having their material needs met. Thus, society has set up a system of rewards that go beyond material goods. These include titles, social recognition, status, and political power, all wrapped up in a package called self-fulfilment. Attracted by these prizes and goaded on by social pressure, people spend their short lives tiring body and mind to chase after these goals. Perhaps this gives them the feeling that they have achieved something in their lives, but in reality, they have sacrificed a lot in life. They can no longer see, hear, act, feel, or think from their hearts. Everything they do is dictated by whether it can get them social gains. In the end, they've spent their lives following other people's demands and never lived a life of their own.
