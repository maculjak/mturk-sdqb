Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm. Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of <mark>O'Neill</mark>'s. \"Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!\" commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist <mark>Kevin Williamson</mark> interviewed the celebrated war hero. \"It was nothing really. Those kids didn't have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,\" <mark>O'Neill</mark> stated. The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.

In a statement to staff posted on Twitter, CBS said <mark>Rose</mark> was terminated \"effective immediately .\" \"This followed the revelation yesterday of extremely disturbing and intolerable behavior said to have revolved around his PBS program,\" the statement read in part. \"Despite <mark>Charlie</mark>'s important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organization, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace .\" Shortly thereafter, PBS released a statement of its own: \"In light of yesterday's revelations, PBS has terminated its relationship with <mark>Charlie Rose</mark> and canceled distribution of his programs. PBS expects all the producers we work with to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect .\" <mark>Rose</mark>'s dismissal came after multiple women shared their personal stories with The Washington Post and Business Insider. The Post reported that <mark>Rose</mark>'s accusers either worked with or aspired to work with him on his PBS show, \"<mark>Charlie Rose</mark>,\" from the late 1990s to 2011. At the time of the alleged incidents, the women ranged in age from 21 to 37, according to the paper. Business Insider featured three women, all former \"<mark>Charlie Rose</mark>\" interns, who also accused <mark>Rose</mark> of inappropriate behavior, speaking to the site on the condition of anonymity. Before being fired on Tuesday, <mark>Rose</mark>'s \"CBS This Morning\" co-anchors Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell addressed the situation, calling for an end to the alleged behavior from <mark>Rose</mark> or anyone else in a position of power. \"Let me be very clear, there is no excuse for this alleged behavior,\" O'Donnell said. \"It is systematic and pervasive and I've been doing a lot of listening ....Women cannot achieve equality in the workplace or in society until there is a reckoning and a taking of responsibility .\" <mark>Rose</mark> issued an apology to the Post after the allegations first broke and later shared it on Twitter Monday night. \"In my 45 years in journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked,\" he said in a statement to the newspaper. \"Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues .\" It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken, \"he continued .\" I have learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will too. All of us, including me, are coming to a newer and deeper recognition of the pain caused by conduct in the past, and have come to a profound new respect for women and their lives. \"Related Topics: abc news national Email share share tweet email (Copyright \u00a9 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures .)

The hack was revealed by OurMine in a blog post. Data including one-sheets on featured artists and marketing materials, supposedly 3.12 terabytes worth, was posted to OurMine's website. Hours later, Vevo requested that the stolen info be taken down, and OurMine removed it. In an email to NPR, OurMine, which operates anonymously, claims it did not initially intend to post the data publicly and tried to alert Vevo of the breach privately, but that Vevo responded, \"F *** off, you don't have anything .\" OurMine shared a screenshot of that exchange, which lacked any identifying information and so could not be verified as taking place between the two, with NPR. Vevo would not verify the exchange to NPR when asked. Why was Vevo targeted? In its email to NPR, OurMine wrote, \"Every month we pick random companies to check their security and Vevo was one of them .\" (So it was not this 2016 tweet .) Asked for particulars about the hack, such as when it learned of the attack, whether any user data was posted publicly, when it requested its data be removed from public availability and what steps it was taking to prevent future attacks, Vevo issued this statement: \"We can confirm that Vevo experienced a data breach as a result of a phishing scam via LinkedIn. We have addressed the issue and are investigating the extent of exposure .\" In addition to posting private documents publicly, OurMine is also a business, offering its security services to both individuals (for $30) and companies (price upon request). While high-profile hacks of companies like Vevo and individuals like the singer Troye Sivan and tech mogul Mark Zuckerberg (password: \"dadada\" ) act as marketing for the company--generating articles like the one you're reading now--OurMine says that's not the point of its activities. \"We are doing this to improve the world security, as we said before we start all the hacks we did. No one is safe from hackers, even us!\" According to the group's own posts that doesn't seem to be the whole truth--its hack of BuzzFeed Media in Oct., 2016, appeared to be retaliatory, \"because they are reporting fake news about us .\" The group posted on BuzzFeed's website a warning: \"don't share fake news about us again, we have your database.

because the buildings are too old to care for patients. three nhs lothian hospitals - astley ainslie, corstorphine and liberton - are under threat because they don't provide the \"optimal setting for patient care\". officials said the closures don't pose any threat as more patients are being treated outside of hospitals. but as closures were being discussed the health secretary <mark>alex neil</mark> said more beds are needed to deal with an ageing population. critics accused health bosses of \"singing from different hymn sheets\" and questioned the snp's pledge of maintaining crucial bed numbers. the closures were announced at the same time a planning document set out nhs lothian's priorities over the next eight years. the report stated fewer hospital beds may be required as more patients are set to be treated in the community. bed numbers in lothian across all specialities have been slashed by almost 20% in the last decade from 4445 in 2003 to 3655 in 2012. nhs lothian said it is committed to its major hospitals but can make no guarantees over the smaller sites of astley ainslie, corstorphine and liberton - which have only 467 bed between them. the health board said the buildings \"provide less than optimal setting for patient care\" and that it would now look at \"opportunities to safely move off sites .\" but mr <mark>neil</mark> told workers at a unison conference in glasgow that a growing older population would mean the same number of beds in hospitals would be needed. labour lothians msp sarah boyack called for clarity on the contradicting messages. she said: \"<mark>alex neil</mark> is saying we need the same number of beds to cope with demographic change, yet nhs lothian is talking about reducing bed numbers. it seems like they are singing from different hymn sheets .\" scottish tory health spokesman jackson carlow also accused nhs lothian and mr <mark>neil</mark> of sending out mixed messages. he said: \"there has been no end of negative news stories from nhs lothian about capacity pressure and other issues, how can it come to the conclusion it can afford to cut more beds is beyond me .\" in response mr <mark>neil</mark> said: \"even if we are able, through better treatment at home, to reduce by 50% the level of hospitalisation of our elderly population, we are still going to need the same number of beds, the same number of hospitals, the same number of doctors and nurses just to stand still because this population [over 75s] is doubling .\" professor <mark>alex</mark> mcmahon, director of strategic planning at nhs lothian said the board was committed to modern facilities, and there would be a rise in beds at the edinburgh royal infirmary. he said: \"we will review our current methods of care and make decisions on maintaining, expanding, refurbishing or replacing facilities to ensure we have the right mix of inpatient beds and capacity in the community to meet the needs of the growing population .\" a spokeswoman for the scottish government said: \"we are committed to at least maintaining the level of quality and provision in scotland's nhs -

ected by an october 2010 gallup poll in which 70 percent of americans favor making medical cannabis legally available, colorado's regulated model reflects a national trend. in 2010 and 2011, the colorado general assembly, in a bipartisan effort, codi? ed the licensing, regulation and taxation of medical marijuana businesses. these regulations created a closed-loop system that requires local and state licensing, establishes \"good moral character\" standards for ownership and employment, and mandates rules for security and surveillance aimed at eliminating illicit activity. nationwide, colorado has the most comprehensive and effective medical marijuana regulatory framework. in colorado, regulated medical cannabis has provided medicine to 473 hiv/aids patients, 9,771 patients suffering from severe nausea, 14,112 patients suffering from muscle spasms, 75,424 patients suffering from severe or chronic pain, and 2,181 patients with cancer. despite all the accusations of abuse surrounding this issue, less than 2 percent of colorado's population are registered patients. according to state statistics, the average age of a medical marijuana patient in colorado is 42. as medical marijuana becomes more accepted, its medicinal uses become more apparent. recent studies have shown the potential of cannabis to treat premenstrual syndrome, insomnia, migraines, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, alcohol abuse, arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, depression, huntington's disease, parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, sickle-cell disease, sleep apnea, anorexia nervosa and many forms of cancer. with so much potential, it's not surprising that the federally funded national institute of health currently holds u.s. patent 6,630,507 b1 for \"cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants .\" in addition to providing a mechanism for safe and legal access, regulated medical cannabis is a net positive for the state. it contributes to deferred prosecution and incarceration, as well as providing a source of revenue in hard budgetary times. in total, colorado medical marijuana businesses have paid approximately $20 million in local, state and federal taxes, and another $9 million in licensing and application fees. with regard to jobs, some estimates indicate that the medical cannabis industry has created upwards of 20,000 new jobs, as well as a boom in ancillary businesses such as real-estate, accounting, carpentry, engineering, plumbing, law, medicine and security. a recent university of colorado study indicates that states which pass medical marijuana laws see on average a 9 percent reduction in traffic fatalities. in addition, a 20-year study documented in the journal of the american medical association (january 2012) indicates that smoking cannabis on an occasional basis does not appear to produce adverse effects on lung function. moreover, the increase in criminality predicted by opponents of regulated medical marijuana has simply not materialized. though much has been made of the supposed link between medical marijuana and teen use, finds no evidence that medical marijuana laws are related to the use of marijuana by minors. other studies show that, on average, teen usage decreases after states pass medical marijuana laws. regardless, regulation remains the most effective way to limit unauthorized access and abuse. after all, street dealers do not check ids. the most comprehensive solution likely involves education and prevention initiatives, restrictions on advertising and increased penalties for illicit diversion to minors. though colorado attorney general john suthers opposes the state's medical marijuana program, consider the alternative - the continuation of a failed policy that criminalizes patients and subsidizes a violent black market operating clandestinely out of homes and public lands. this emboldened black market would pose an immediate threat to public safety and further strain our state's limited resources. u.s. attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> has issued recommendations to u.s. attorneys to use their prosecutorial discretion, in light of limited resources, to focus on those individuals and organizations who are not in \"unambiguous compliance with state law .\" meanwhile, in colorado, the democratic process has made regulated medical cannabis the law of the land, and it is the duty of our state of?

Mr Moon remarked that \"it's necessary for North Korea to present far more concrete denuclearisation plans, and I think it's necessary for the United States to swiftly reciprocate by coming up with comprehensive measures .\" US and South Korean officials are hoping the suspension yesterday of a major joint military exercise will help solidify nuclear negotiations with the DPRK. And North Korea could begin the process of handing over the remains of troops missing in the Korea war in the next few days, including those of US soldiers. Cambridge Analytica denies tampering Aleksandr Kogan, the British professor at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, denied that the user data he provided to the firm helped in targeting voters during the 2016 US election. \"I believe there is almost no chance this data could have been helpful to a political campaign--and I still have not seen any evidence to indicate that the Trump campaign used this dataset to micro-target voters,\" Dr Kogan told the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. However, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie says he was aware of efforts by the firm to reduce voter engagement and turnout among certain demographic groups. Mr Wylie says he \"was aware of various projects where voter suppression\" was discussed at the firm, including efforts to \"demotivate turnout\" by certain \"target groups,\" primarily African Americans. Violence in Israel A major escalation of violence flared up overnight between Israel and the militants in the Gaza Strip after Hamas fired a volley of rockets at Israeli territory, leading the Israeli military to target 25 Palestinian militant Hamas group positions in Gaza. Israel's Iron Dome defence system intercepted seven of the 45 rockets fired into Israel, and there have been no immediate official reports of deaths or injuries from the militant attacks. The escalation started shortly after Israel carried out strikes against three Hamas sites in response to Palestinians flying fire kites and balloons over the Gaza border, which have caused significant damage to Israeli territory."}, {"articleID": "2014032401_00008252_W", "names": {"John Regan": ["Q10470735", "Q58938074", "Q6066150", "Q6254507"]}, "date": "2014-03-23", "url": "http://historiccity.com/2014/staugustine/news/florida/editorial-free-nation-without-free-press-43639", "content": "MICHAEL GOLD Editorial: No free nation without a free press HISTORIC CITY NEWS St Augustine FL Historic City News readers who know me, are not surprised to learn that I have written a \"harsh\" article, probably half sarcastic and half tongue-in-cheek, about government transparency, fraud, waste and abuse in government, or elected officials who think they are privileged, or show a sense of entitlement above the people. But, if you are close enough to really know me, you know that although I may write jokingly about politicians or bureaucrats and their behavior, I really don't think it's a joke and I am a strong advocate for government and public integrity. One of my strongest issues is the right to a free press. I often write, and believe, that news should be free and freely available to readers. But, a free press, in the Constitutional sense from which I draw the expression, refers to the freedom of press reporters to gather news and freely publish it, as they see fit, un-edited by self-serving forces - especially the government. I was a little ticked this week, actually I was pissed off, after St Augustine City Manager <mark>John Regan</mark> told a Historic City News reader on facebook that I was trying to \"sucker\" her with a harmless news article, from third party sources, informing the public about a proposal to offer a trolley service between the Visitor Information Center and Riberia Pointe. Although the defamation of me and Historic City News, that occurred between the City Manager and the reader, was likely seen by hundreds of citizens, that wasn't what had upset me. It was the written comment he made to me, publicly, saying, \"I would appreciate you calling me to discuss before you write articles about the city .\" Of course, after the news broke on historiccity.com, it was picked up by other news reporters, including former mayor, George Gardner, but not the local newspaper - which did not surprise me, given the history of their reporting on local government. Perhaps I should infer from <mark>Regan</mark>'s remarks and the Record's past (non) reporting on local politics and government, that they check with him before they do \"write articles about the city\". Our readers may rest assured that Historic City News will always be the ones asking questions. We will never put publication of an article on hold merely because the reporter has not discussed the article with the City Manager, beforehand. I maintain a collegial relation with <mark>John Regan</mark>; I like his personality, I think he is well educated, and, I voiced my support for his appointment even before Bill Harriss retired. That hasn't changed."}, {"articleID": "2015110521_00118061_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"]}, "date": "2015-11-05", "url": "http://nbcnews.com/video/four-dead-in-shooting-in-central-maine-560236099944", "content": "Feedback advertisement advertisement NBC News Video Sponsored By LIVE NOW Follow NBC News Facebook Twitter Google Plus Newsletter More RSS Youtube Tumblr Instagram Sorry, this video needs JavaScript turned on Play Four Dead in Shooting in Central Maine Investigators are not yet sure what led 42-year-old Herman Derico to shoot and kill three housemates and then himself.
