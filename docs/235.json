Listen as Raynita Nebeker and Dennis Horn relate their experiences of discrimination just because of hair style. By Up Next \u00d7 SHARE COPY LINK Listen as Raynita Nebeker and Dennis Horn relate their experiences of discrimination just because of hair style. By Dennis Horn has endured numerous uncomfortable moments in the workplace, based on the natural hairstyles he's sported in the past. A Fresno resident, Horn said the dreadlocks, cornrows, braids and afros he's worn over the years often spurred unwanted attention. His hair sometimes became a topic of discussion by his peers and supervisors in his corporate job. On top of that were the numerous questions by his co-workers: Is it natural? What did you do to it? Is it extensions? Can you wash it? While the 33 - year-old said he welcomed questions of genuine curiosity, those inquires sometimes had a hint of disdain--whether it was racially motivated or just plain ignorance. \"I remember once, when I actually cut my hair, a comment was made that I was\" ready to be mature' and \"go places,\" ' he recalled. \"That was never my intention in cutting my hair .\" Horn said he knows he's not alone in those feelings. A bill is being discussed in Sacramento that would ban schools and workplaces from discriminating against people based on their natural hairstyles. Proposed by Sen. Holly J. Mitchell, D-Los Angeles, Senate Bill 188 is being referred to as the CROWN Act (Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair). Fresno resident Dennis Horn, shown with his dreadlocks hair style. Courtesy Dennis Horn Hair discrimination is a problem Mitchell and SB 188's supporters said is commonplace. For example, in December, the story of a 16-year-old New Jersey high school varsity wrestler made headlines after he was asked by a referee to cut his dreadlocks on the spot or forfeit his match. There was outrage after the story went viral. A toddler in Fresno was sent home on his first day of school last year because he had a fade haircut with a design on his scalp. The teacher allegedly told his parents the child couldn't return to class until his hair was \"fixed\" because it was \"distracting,\" said Raynita Nebeker, a local special education teacher. In 2016, prior to the Clovis Unified School District revising its controversial dress code, 17-year-old William Pleasant's hair was initially the reasoning behind the teen not being able to enroll at Buchanan High School for his senior year. Boys couldn't have their hair longer than their shirt collar. More recently in 2018, a 14-year-old at Tenaya Middle School was pulled out of class and sent to the vice principal's office due to his hair. The student had lines shaved in a design on his hair, and was told to get it \"fixed .\" The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California has been involved in a few local hair discrimination cases. \"It's unfortunate that in 2019, black people are being punished for their hair, and that it is so widespread,\" said ACLU staff attorney Abre' Conner, who has helped intervene in some of the local cases. Conner said there are already protections within the schools, but explicitly adding language about \"protective hairstyles\" will help close a chapter in California of discipline that has been \"rooted in a legacy of racism and gender bias .\" State Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) speaks to the media in Sacramento, Calif. on Jan. 24, 2017. (Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/TNS) Gary Coronado TNS Mitchell told The Bee that through the years, there have been court rulings favoring employers against employees who felt they were being discriminated against based on their ethnic hair. She called that system \"racist, antiquated or ill-informed,\" saying there \"should be protections from discrimination in the workplaces and schools .\" Additionally, SB 188 points out there historically has been a double standard in the workplace, in terms of how black employees are expected to wear their hair, compared to their white colleagues. The bill states the idea of \"professionalism\" in the American workplace has typically been tied to European looks, often forcing non-whites to conform to a Euro-centric aesthetic. Consequently, many black women for decades felt they had to chemically process or straighten their hair in order to be accepted in a predominantly white workplace. Meanwhile, black men have often cut their hair short. \"(Hair texture) does not dictate my ability to do my job well,\" Mitchell said. \"I have been shocked by the outpouring of support from people who have told me about their horror stories for wearing natural hair in the workplace .\" If the bill passes both houses and gets signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, Mitchell said it would put \"employers and schools on notice .\" Horn said he did eventually cut his hair in 2016, although, it wasn't in response to any negative comments or discrimination. \"As of recently, I've never had to deal with anything like that,\" he said of the discomfort and comments he faced prior to cutting his hair. Nebeker said that in many schools, the type of hairstyles allowed often go along with student dress codes. \"They have certain restrictions on what they can and can't do, and their hair is one of the big ones that they have restrictions on, as well,\" she said. \"So, I know, it's (the discrimination) also in the schools .\" She said SB 188 would make an impact, if it becomes law. \"I feel that a lot of students express themselves through their hair...because that's where you are finding your identity, and your real self and being comfortable with yourself .\" A history with deep roots Beyond its aesthetic appeal, black hair has a history and significance that many Americans are unaware of. Many black hairstyles--like various kinds of braids--have been worn on the African continent for thousands of years. During the late 1960s and 1970s, human rights activists like <mark>Angela Davis</mark> wore afros as a political symbol of black pride. Many black Americans have recently adopted natural hairstyles as an alternative to harsh chemicals which can cause permanent damage. <mark>Dominique Jones</mark> has faced discrimination for her hairstyle. Photographed Friday, April 26, 2019 in Fresno. <mark>ERIC PAUL</mark> ZAMORA ezamora @ fresnobee.com Devoya Mayo and <mark>Dominique Jones</mark> of Fresno have held workshops locally about black hair, focusing in particular on headwraps, teaching participants how to wrap their hair. Mayo and <mark>Jones</mark> said that every time a member in a black household is considering a new hairstyle, there's much more to consider aside from the hairdo--including the societal implications. Mayo said she supports the proposed legislation because she hopes there will eventually become a time when those kind of discussions or concerns are no longer necessary. \"I have always worked in the nonprofit industry, no one has advertently or blatantly (been) racist about hairstyles, but there have been spaces that I've been in where, I think all of us have been in, where I know for a fact we're uncomfortable because of our hair, and it shouldn't be that way,\" Mayo said. <mark>Jones</mark> said the workshops were \"to help black women embrace our culture and it helped us connect to our roots, and just express ourselves in a way that is not normalized in our community .\" SB 188 has cleared the Senate, and is now in the Assembly.

While the Gladstone Regional Council pushes for another coal-fired power station to be built in the region, business owner and aviator Hugh Bridge believes our mountainous surrounds out west are the perfect location to build dams for pumped-storage hydroelectricity in order to store excess energy. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing - like a big battery. It's a method which stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir. When there's higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, therefore generating electricity. The amount of megawatts produced by such a facility would depend on various factors including the falling distance of water and the rate at which water spills per litre every second. Mr Bridge, a Cessna plane owner, doesn't believe these ideas are pie in the sky. The 69-year-old has flown over one million kilometres of land and has seen plenty of mountains along the Great Dividing Range with potential to base a pumped-storage facility. OPTIONS: The mountains west of Gladstone would be the perfect place for a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility. <mark>Mike Richards</mark> GLA080417HYDRO \"We've reached the stage where a lot of our power stations are reaching the end of their useful life and they're talking about replacing them,\" Mr Bridge said. \"If we're going to replace them it would be nonsense to build more coal-powered ones - we should be building clean power stations .\" Providing it was practical to do so, I would be building wind turbines in suitable places along the Great Dividing Range, solar farms on the other side of the range where it is drier and also building the high and low dams to do the pumped-storage hydroelectricity. \"Mr Bridge says he's not against mining, but believes alternatives must be found to replace coal mining .\" I would like to see all tiers of government start taking the carbon dioxide pollution of the atmosphere seriously, \"he said .\" They seem to think because (Australia) only contributes a small percentage it doesn't matter too much. \"They should keep in mind we are amongst the highest polluters per head of population in the world .\" Global warming could be a runaway effect; once it starts it could be nearly impossible to stop its effects. \"These renewable projects would lower energy prices, lower carbon emissions and lower unemployment, Mr Bridge said. carbon emissions Read More Login to follow clean energy Read More Login to follow gladstone region Read More Login to follow hydro electricity Read More Login to follow hydro power Read More Login to follow renewable energy Read More Login to follow Topics: carbon emissions clean energy gladstone region hydro electricity hydro power renewable energy 0 PRINT Have your say Stay Connected Update your news preferences and get the latest news delivered to your inbox.

Junior Kyle Kashuv said he was brought in for questioning Monday by a school security officer and a Broward County deputy in what he says was an attempt to intimidate him. It was great learning about our inalienable right of #2A and how to properly use a gun. This was my first time ever touching a gun and it made me appreciate the #Constitution even more. My instructor was very informative; I learnt a lot. #2A is important and we need 2 preserve 2A pic.twitter.com/4rcOZbpl88--Kyle Kashuv (@ KyleKashuv) April 21, 2018 \"I can now check off being wrongfully questioned by law enforcement off my bucket list,\" tweeted Kashuv, adding \"school will be interesting for the remainder of my tenure at MSD. I am not looking forward to it .\" On Tuesday, Kashuv told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the meeting with officials was an interrogation. \"It was a clear attempt to intimidate me, and they used very, very, very harsh intimidation tactics,\" Kashuv said. After first being questioned by a school security officer, a Broward County deputy entered the room and sat behind the teen, Kashuv said. The deputy began asking Kashuv who the rifle belonged to and who he went shooting with. Kashuv said he asked if he could record the interview and was told that he couldn't. The teen said he felt like the deputy was trying to get him to incriminate his father. Kashuv said the gun debate has become so prominent since the Valentine's Day massacre that killed 17 that he \"felt it was important to learn about the physical mechanics of it,\" Kashuv said in a text to The Associated Press. \"I made sure to post about it because I wanted to show people it's people that are the issue, not guns .\" Kashuv also tweeted \"Apparently using my constitutional rights to learn how to defend myself is wrong? Sorry, I thought this was still the United States of America .\" On Friday, Kashuv posted videos on Twitter showing him firing an AR-15 rifle at a target, saying it \"strengthened my love for 2A\" and taught him \"America is the greatest country ever, where freedom intensifies and liberty is required to be a real American .\" His posts came as thousands of students around the country walked out of school for gun reform in honour of the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting. Kashuv has been a vocal supporter of gun rights and garnered heavy support from conservative pro-gun groups. The teen has drawn criticism from the core #NeverAgain students, including Emma Gonzalez and <mark>David Hogg</mark>, who have repeatedly called for a ban on assault rifles. A Broward Sheriff's Office incident report confirmed the meeting, but didn't provide any specific response to Kashuv's claim that the deputy used interrogation techniques against him. A school security supervisor told the deputy several students had expressed concern about the social media post, even though no threats were on the video, the report said. When asked about the post, Kashuv said he had borrowed the rifle from a friend and went shooting with his father, the report said. Officials contacted Kashuv's mother, who stated she knew about the video and the trip to the gun range.

batch, who was far from elite but at least outplayed joe flacco in the steelers' win in baltimore. but no one was expecting greatness. batch just gave more of what he's offered these past 10 years as pittsburgh's backup (or third-string) quarterback: a steady, capable option under center, who'll give you a chance to win at least some of the games he's forced into starting. you can't ask for much more. he's really old, though. batch turns 38 on wednesday, making him the same age as long-gone signal callers like jake plummer, danny wuerffel, and jake delhomme. for a sense of perspective, batch's main safety valve as a rookie was throwing dump passes to a running back named <mark>barry sanders</mark>. 1998 was <mark>sanders</mark>'s last year in the league, and batch's first. after setting nearly every passing record at eastern michigan, he became an instant local favorite when he was drafted by the lions in the second round. after two games, <mark>scott mitchell</mark> couldn't get it done, so the lions turned the reins over to batch. and in his second career start-a monday night game against the buccaneers-batch recorded his first win, thanks in large part to <mark>sanders</mark>. this, despite tampa bay explicitly promising they were going to force batch to beat them. \"i think we're going to have to [focus on <mark>sanders</mark>],\" tony dungy said. \"the focus is always <mark>barry sanders</mark> when you play them, and we've got to really do a good job on him and not let him get going. if we can get ahead of them, get in a mode like minnesota was, where once they got up now you're just turning everything you've got loose at the quarterback, it's going to be tough on a rookie quarterback - whether it's charlie batch or ryan leaf. peyton manning, the same thing .\" so we've really got to concentrate on <mark>barry</mark> and make sure that we don't let him get going, and then make the quarterback throw. \"it didn't matter. watch some of the batch-to-sanders highlights above (all taken from this youtube video); even an inexperienced qb and a prepared defense couldn't stop <mark>sanders</mark> from doing his thing. <mark>sanders</mark> rushed 27 times and put up 175 all-purpose yards, while batch went 14-for-23 for 115 yards. batch added his first career score, running for a one-yard touchdown, as the lions won 27-6. <mark>sanders</mark> would unexpectedly retire after the season, and detroit's run game went in the tank. in response, batch was asked to become more of a running quarterback than he was comfortable being, and that led directly to a series of injuries. he missed multiple games each of his remaining three years in detroit, and wasn't re-signed after the 2001 season. the hybrid style he had adopted served him well-he was signed to the steelers by gm kevin colbert, who had scouted and drafted him for the lions. he was the ideal backup to then-pittsburgh qb kordell stewart-if\" slash \"went down, batch could enter as a scrambling qb without the team missing a beat. stewart's gone, as are tommy maddox and dennis dixon, but batch remains. ben roethlisberger's stand-up style of play is different, but he's just as prone to injury-in 2005, when roethlisberger went down midseason, batch stepped in and went 2-0. in a year in which 10-6 wasn't good enough to make the afc playoffs, the steelers finished 11-5 and went on to win super bowl xl."}, {"articleID": "2011120917_00078243_W", "names": {"Robert Jensen": ["Q48743679", "Q512738", "Q7346093"]}, "date": "2011-12-09", "url":

e-mail: invalid e-mail address sending your article your article has been sent. cheyenne, wyo. - gov. matt mead wants to up the ante in trying to entice technology jobs to wyoming by proposing to double the money the state makes available to help build data centers and other digital facilities and broaden the types of firms eligible to tap the funds. mead said thursday he wants wyoming to be as \"attractive as possible to these companies\" to bring in jobs and new tax revenue. wyoming established a $15 million fund last year to help pay for infrastructure, such as water service, for new mega data centers after verizon communications inc. looked at locating a $4 billion data center near laramie. the company decided against building one for now after it acquired a separate company that already had data centers, and the state fund remained unused. mead's budget proposal released last week seeks to expand the fund to $30 million and broaden it to include other types of tech-related facilities. \"in doubling the funding there's more opportunity for big projects and also a pool of money for other technology projects,\" mead said through his spokesman renny mackay. <mark>robert jensen</mark>, ceo of the wyoming business council, said that while the fund hasn't been tapped yet these types of complicated projects take time and it's important the state has the money available. \"to have some funding in the governor's office that he has the ability to put toward infrastructure that supports their location here, that's good news and the industry will take note of that,\" <mark>jensen</mark> said. he said his office is actively talking with several data center operators about locating in wyoming. the discussion involved projects not as large as what verizon was looking at, but they are still \"significant,\" he said. \"anything can happen,\" <mark>jensen</mark> said. \"the point is that the industry is still viable. it's still growing. we still have a compelling package for them, and people are listening to us .\" he added broadening the fund could attract other types of technology firms, such as those that produce software .? copyright 2011 associated press.

Picture: Getty Cricket Aussie superheroes skittle England by Selina Steele in Hove 29th Jul 2019 6:10 AM premium_icon Subscriber only 0 WHAT'S better than one superhero? Two of course. Which is exactly what the Southern Stars have in Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry. Meg Lanning of Australia dives to make her ground as <mark>Amy Jones</mark> of England takes the bails off during the 2nd Vitality Women's IT20 in Hove, England. Picture: Getty Australia was experiencing a little wobble at 3-35 until Perry joined Lanning for an unbeaten 87-run partnership to claim victory in the second Ashes T20 international. While Lanning's T20 World record of 133 not out was all muscle and force, her knock today at County Ground, Hove was calculated grit. The seven wicket win came with 2.1 overs to spare, Perry finishing on 47 not out and Lanning on 43 not out. But England had its chance with Lanning. If only stand-in keeper <mark>Amy Jones</mark> had the forethought to backhand the ball at the stumps a-la Alyssa Healy. Natalie Sciver of England is bowled out by Georgia Wareham of Australia during the T20 in Hove. Picture: Getty Instead, Lanning survived a run-out scare without having faced a ball. It would have been a diamond duck but Lanning's full body dive, Kate Cross's wide throw and <mark>Jones</mark>'s reach for the stumps were enough to save the Aussie skipper. At that stage Austalia was 1/23. At first it seemed far fetched when England coach <mark>Mark Robinson</mark> said Australia was just a side that were gifted \"God given physical attributes\". Perhaps he was right and this dominance was delivered on divine intervention. Perhaps he was wrong and it was the years of training, preparation and strong domestic competition. Georgia Wareham of Australia celebrates with her teammates. Picture: Getty Either way, Australia continued its summer of dominance with Ellyse Perry becoming the first player, male or female, to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. \"I guess it's lovely, but I wasn't aware of it,\" Perry said. \"I actually think in T20 cricket at international level, we probably play it as much as the men, so I have played a pretty big volume of games now - over 100, so I suppose when you have played 100 games you might get close to it. Ellyse Perry became the first player to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. Picture: Henry Browne/Getty Images\" That's probably the only reason I'm there - because I've played a lot of games. \"It has just been really nice to turn up every game and for us to perform and to find a way to win and win dominantly .\" It was really cool to be out there with Meg. I really enjoy batting with her and she's incredible when she's going. To be at the other end is quite easy really. \"Here's how the game unfolded: IN A SNAPSHOT: England won the toss and perhaps fearing another Meg Lanning masterclass, and the game being over in six overs, decide to bat. On the back of Tammy Beaumont, they bat through the 20 overs finishing 8-121. A six in the final over from Sophie Ecclestone sets Australia a run rate of 6.10. Meg Lanning strikes good form during the first game of the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty After a shaky start, Lanning and Perry to put together a chanceless partnership of 87 to guide Australia to victory. BUNNY BAIT: Australia's Ellyse Perry, opening the bowling, bewitched <mark>Amy Jones</mark> for the fourth time this series. With zero footwork, <mark>Jones</mark> spooned a catch to Georgia Wareham at cover point and England was 1/1 after the first over. THE HEROES: Lanning and Perry. Ridiculously talented, ridiculously smart, ridiculously patient. The composed pair happily waited for the bad ball, which inevitably would come, and easily ticked off the run a ball needed. Beth Mooney has been another star for Australia in the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty A six in the 15th over from Perry saw Australia needing 18 off 28 and it was all over bar a Pimm's to celebrate. SUPPORT ACTS: * Jess Jonassen's wicket in her first over, getting rid of Danni Wyatt, was due to the hot hands of Beth Mooney. Mooney running back with flight of the ball judged the catch perfectly. But ouch - this is where we don't mention her dropping Tammy Beaumont when Beaumont was on 35. But we do have to mention Mooney dropping Beaumont again on 39. Both chances were not as difficult as the one she held. Jonassen takes matters into her own hands and bowls Beaumont for 43 in the 12th over. * Warm up? What warm up! Georgia Wareham snared the dangerous Nat Sciver first ball. The England all rounder went across her stumps to glance the ball down fine leg but completely missed the ball. The leggie then backs this up by snaring England captain <mark>Heather Knight</mark>. Easy as you like, Wareham takes a gentle return catch after <mark>Knight</mark> came at her down the pitch. THE RECORD That player again - Perry. Ellyse Perry received player of the match for Australia in the recent Test against England and is setting records in the T20 arena. Picture: Getty Perry is the first player, either male or female, to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1000 STATE OF PLAY The post-mortem has already begun for England - records have fallen all series and all in favour of the Australians. England's domestic structure is being questioned while Australia's lauded. In comparison, The Southern Stars have set themselves up for a dynasty. Headlined by superstars Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry, and with the likes of Sophie Molineux and Georgia Wareham coming through it's hard to see other nations catching them. NEXT UP: 3rd T20 International at Bristol on July 31. More green and gold dominance. Can't see where England will find any improvement. Australia to go through the series undefeated.
