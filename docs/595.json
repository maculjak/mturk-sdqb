Content Continues Below The Minnesota senator dropped out of the 2020 race on the eve of Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Fellow former candidates Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Mike Bloomberg soon followed. Klobuchar will visit with union members in Detroit on Friday before hosting a Women for Biden event in Southfield, Michigan. On Saturday, Klobuchar will speak at a get-out-the-vote event in Grand Rapids. Biden won 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday, including delegate-rich Texas. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders captured four states, including the biggest prize of all, California. ___ 12:50 p.m. Elizabeth Warren says she will not be running for president in 2020 but guarantees that she will stay in the fight. Speaking to reporters Thursday outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Warren said she'd likely endorse one of the two major candidates left in the race, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, but \"not today .\" \"I need some space and I need a little time right now,\" she said, standing next to her husband, <mark>Bruce Mann</mark>, and golden retriever, Bailey. Warren's voice cracked when she talked about meeting so many little girls while campaigning around the country for the past year and knowing they \"are going to have to wait four more years,\" at least, to see a woman in the White House. The Massachusetts senator was the Democratic presidential primary's last top female candidate. She suspended her campaign Thursday, two days after a disappointing Super Tuesday that included a third-place finish in her home state. Warren added: \"I have no regrets at all. This has been the honor of a lifetime .\" ___ 10:50 a.m. Elizabeth Warren has ended her Democratic presidential bid after a disappointing finish in Super Tuesday states. That's according to a person familiar with her plans who wasn't authorized to speak about Warren's intentions and talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity. The Massachusetts senator's campaign had the markers of success: robust poll numbers, impressive fundraising, a national organization. But she was squeezed out by Bernie Sanders, who had an immovable base of voters she needed to advance. In the end, she didn't even win her home state--she finished third behind Joe Biden, who won it, and Sanders. Her exit from the race on Thursday came days after Amy Klobuchar dropped out.

Yet no one among the sellout crowd of 9,472 Thursday at JetBlue Park for the first Red Sox-Astros encounter of the spring seemed to mind. When the Red Sox clubhouse opened at 8 a.m., the lineup cards for both teams were posted just inside the door. Familiar names filled out the Red Sox' side--Xander Bogaerts (at shortstop for the first time this spring), J.D. Martinez, Rafael Devers. It was not far from the lineup they'll wield on Opening Day March 26 in Toronto. The Astros' side was a different matter. Manager Dusty Baker's batting order included relative obscurities with the last names Dawson (Ronnie, not Andre), Stubbs (Garrett, not Franklin or Drew), and Mayfield (Jack, definitely not Baker). Advertisement Alex Bregman did not make the two-plus-hour trip from the Astros' camp in Kissimmee. Neither did Jose Altuve, <mark>Carlos Correa</mark>, or <mark>George Springer</mark>. There was not a single Astro that baseball-reference. com considered a starter from last year's team. Aledmys Diaz, who had 247 plate appearances last year as <mark>Correa</mark>'s understudy, was the most experienced Astro in the lineup. The entire lineup combined for 640 plate appearances in the majors last season, or 50 fewer than Bregman alone. The most notable member of the champion 2017 Astros to put in an appearance at JetBlue Thursday was pitcher Collin McHugh, who stopped in to sign a one-year contract with the Red Sox. The absence of any Astro with legitimate name recognition was naturally a cause of suspicion given the events of the offseason. The Astros were busted in a sign-stealing scandal that cost general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch their jobs and has led many fans to put a mental asterisk on their 2017 World Series title. The collateral damage reached Boston, too, with former Astros bench coach Alex Cora losing his managerial job with the Red Sox for his role as a mastermind of the Astros' cheating. The Red Sox, accused of a sign-stealing scheme of their own during Cora's tenure, are still waiting to learn the consequences. Advertisement For now, the Astros are the sole wearers of the black hats, baseball's bad guys, the sport's most collectively disliked franchise in recent memory. They've been booed lustily in opposing territory this spring, and seven Houston batters were hit by pitches through the first week of spring training games. Perhaps it's wise for preservation purposes to keep theelite players away from road crowds for a while. But manager Dusty Baker, Hinch's replacement and a calming presence who each day must face questions about a scandal he had nothing to do with, said he left his stars home for case-by-case reasons. \"You've got Altuve who is sick,\" said Baker, holding court in the Astros' dugout two hours before the game. \"You've got [Yordan] Alvarez who is dealing with his knee. Bregman and Altuve went to Lakeland [to play the Tigers Wednesday]. I try to play them every other day. So no, it's not out of the ordinary at all .\" Baker did acknowledge that his roster was a little short of recognizable major league talent. Teams are supposed to bring a minimum of four regulars to each road game. \"The hardest part is having four regulars that can go, because we don't have a utility-type team,\" said Baker. \"We were told Diaz didn't count, and he has four years in the big leagues .\" Advertisement Baker was asked who actually does count. \"Bregman,\" he deadpanned. \"Altuve...\"So this starless sky of a lineup he brought with him had nothing to do with avoiding a potentially loud and aggravated reception from Boston fans?\" Hell, no, \"said Baker .\" That was the furthest thing from my mind. \"Perhaps it was because all of the familiar names and suspected trash-can bangers were not in attendance, but it turned out that there was no obvious negative response to the Astros anyway. There were no boo birds among the snowbirds. No hoots or verbal jabs were aimed at leadoff hitter Myles Straw when he dug in. A foul pole to foul pole walk through the concourse in the first inning revealed not a single anti-Astros sign in the crowd. Signs are not technically prohibited in JetBlue's ballpark rules (don't try to bring in beach balls, flag poles, lawn chairs, firearms, or knives of any size, however). Three ticket takers working Gate B told me that they hadn't seen a single sign all day. Of course, maybe Red Sox fans should be hesitant to let the Astros have it quite yet since any punishment for their own team's alleged sign-stealing scheme is pending, and has been pending for a somewhat alarming amount of time. To totally hate on the Astros before knowing your own team's consequences would be akin to playing baseball in a glass house, something Baker subtly noted before the game.

David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the government agency that manages the coral expanse off northeast Australia, said ocean temperatures over the next month will be crucial to how the reef recovers from heat-induced bleaching. \"The forecasts...indicate that we can expect ongoing levels of thermal stress for at least the next two weeks and maybe three or four weeks,\" Wachenfeld said in a weekly update on the reef's health on Thursday. \"So this still is a critical time for the reef and it is the weather conditions over the next two to four weeks that will determine the final outcome,\" he said. Ocean temperatures across most of the reef were 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the March average. In parts of the marine park in the south close to shore which avoided the ravages of previous bleachings, ocean temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above average. The authority has received 250 reports of sightings of bleached coral due to elevated ocean temperatures during an unusually hot February. The 345,400-square kilometer (133,360-square mile) World Heritage-listed colorful coral network has been devastated by four coral bleaching events since 1998. The most deadly were the most recent, in consecutive summers in 2016 and 2017. Scientists fear the latest coral death rate could match those events. \"At the moment, it's definitely the most extensive bleaching event we've ever had,\" U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch scientist <mark>William Skirving</mark> said Friday. \"It's certainly an end-to-end bleaching event with severe bits at each end and it's not looking good for the southern end, but it really depends on the weather in the next two weeks,\" he said. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a scientist from the Australian Research Council Center for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies, said how much of the bleached coral would recover and how much would die would not be known for weeks. \"I'm very worried about the situation given how warm the temperatures are on the Great Barrier Reef and what the projections are,\" Hoegh-Guldberg said. \"If it cools down a bit, they'll recover or, if not, we may head off into something not too different from 2016 and 2017. We're right at the fork in the road,\" he added. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority last year downgraded its outlook for the corals' condition from \"poor\" to \"very poor\" due to warming oceans. Its latest report, which is updated every five years, found the greatest threat to the reef remained climate change. The other threats are associated with coastal development, land-based water runoff and human activity such as illegal fishing.

There are now a total of 1,112 confirmed cases in Europe's biggest economy, with the region of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) reporting 484 infections--the highest number among Germany's 16 states. In a bid to slow contagion, Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for gatherings of more than 1,000 people to be scrapped across Germany, which could affect many events including Bundesliga football matches. NRW state premier Armin Laschet said he planned to follow Spahn's advice in scrapping large gatherings in the state, meaning that several football games, including Saturday's derby between Dortmund and Schalke could be played in empty stadiums. Wednesday's game between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne would also be affected, said NRW health minister Karl-Josef Laumann. \"I will let the clubs decide if they want to play without spectators or if they prefer to not play at all,\" he told public broadcaster ARD. Also based in the region, second-division club VfL Bochum said Monday it has stopped selling tickets for upcoming matches. German Football League chief Christian Seifert has said the season must end by mid-May, in a sign that matches would likely be played behind closed doors in a bid to keep to the schedule. With measures taken to halt the virus hitting the economy hard, leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition agreed an aid package. The coalition \"is taking action in the corona-crisis. Besides medical protection measures, we have agreed on a big aid package for the German economy,\" tweeted Markus Soeder, leader of Merkel's Bavarian allies CSU, calling the package \"comprehensive\".

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told the Old Bailey on Monday that the alleged murder of the 28-year-old constable was\" a completely senseless killing \". Pc Harper died from multiple injuries when he was pulled along behind a car after responding to the reported theft of a quad bike from a home near the village of Sulhamstead in Berkshire. One witness mistakenly thought he had seen a bloodied deer attached to the car before realising it was a man being dragged along, the jury heard. Henry Long, 18, from Mortimer, Reading, and two 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all deny murdering the Thames Valley Police officer in August last year. Court artist sketch of Henry Long, 18 (left) (Elizabeth Cook/PA) Mr Altman told jurors:\" Late at night, on Thursday August 15 of last year, in Berkshire, 28-year-old Andrew Harper, a serving police constable of Thames Valley Police, was killed in truly shocking circumstances. \"With his ankles caught in a strap that was trailing behind a car being driven at speed along a country lane, he was dragged for over a mile along the road surface, swung from side to side like a pendulum in an effort to dislodge him, losing items of his police uniform along the way, with the rest of his uniform being quite literally ripped and stripped from his body .\" When, at last, he became disentangled, he was left with the most awful injuries, from which he died there on the road, surrounded by colleagues who tried in vain to save him. \"Mr Harper, left wearing only his socks and boots, suffered injuries that were unsurvivable, the court heard. The jury was told:\" This was a completely senseless killing of a young police officer in the line of duty. \"Long has admitted manslaughter, which the younger boys deny, and all three have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal a quad bike. Several members of Pc Harper's family were in court as the prosecution case opened. Police and flowers left at the scene where Thames Valley Police officer Pc Andrew Harper, 28, died. (Dominic Lipinski/PA) Pc Harper, known as\" Harps \"to his colleagues, was part of Thames Valley's Roads Policing Unit, and had been due to work a 10am to 7pm shift that day. He was still on duty with crew mate Pc <mark>Andrew Shaw</mark> at 11.17 pm, and they were driving in an unmarked police BMW fitted with emergency lights. The pair, who were both wearing uniform, answered the call to the reported theft of the quad bike although it was past the end of their shift. Mr Altman said:\" Despite it being well beyond the end of their shift, because they were close and thought they could help, they responded to the call. It was a decision that was to cost Andrew Harper his life. \"Prosecutors claim that the three defendants had planned the theft, visiting the home of owner Peter Wallis earlier that day and taking steps to avoid being caught by police. It is alleged that having been challenged by Mr Wallis earlier in the day, they returned with items that could be used as weapons if they were challenged, including crowbars, an axe and a hammer. Mr Altman said:\" They were ready, as part of their planning, if necessary, to use the items they had brought with them as weapons if anyone stood in their way. \"Sensibly, Mr Wallis did not stand in their way this time .\" Pc Harper did try to stand in their way, and he paid the ultimate price for it. \"The court heard that the officers were driving along a country lane, Lambdens Hill, on their way to the call when they met a Seat Toledo, driven by Long, coming the other way. One of the 17-year-olds was in the passenger seat, and the other was riding the quad bike which was being towed behind the car, attached to the boot lid hinge with a crane strap that formed a loop. As the cars met, the teenager on the quad bike dismounted, disconnected the strap from the bike and tried unsuccessfully to get into the passenger door of the Seat, as Long began to drive off. Pc <mark>Shaw</mark> turned the BMW's emergency lights on, and the teenager ran to jump through the back passenger window of the Seat. As Pc Harper tried to stop him, the officer's feet were encircled in the crane strap, and he was dragged along as Long drove off. The court heard that Long drove at an average speed of 42.5 mph, leaving a snaking trail of tyre marks, blood and clothing as he swerved across the country lane. A driver who had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting the Seat as it crossed the A4 mistakenly thought Pc Harper was an injured deer. Mr Altman said:\" At first he thought there was a bloodied deer attached to the car, but quickly realised it was a person, trapped by both ankles, being dragged around the road and striking the kerb. \"Pc Harper was barely alive when he was found by his crew mate, and had suffered\" absolutely catastrophic, unsurvivable injuries \", the court heard.", "articleID": "2020031015_00027515_W", "names": {"Andrew Shaw": ["Q4758557", "Q507379"]}}, {"date": "2020-03-11", "url": "http://express.co.uk/news/world/1253757/Coronavirus-update-EU-commission-Ursula-von-der-leyen-italy-lockdown-PM-Conte", "content": "Four confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded in the European Commission after a further three cases tested positive today according to Italian journalist David Carretta.
