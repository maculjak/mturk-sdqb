The Arsenal manager was left beaten by an early second half goal from Stoke's new Spanish forward Jese, signed on loan this week from PSG and whose training had been curtailed by his new-born son requiring a medical procedure. But, while accepting that his side had not performed well, the veteran French manager was also left fuming by two failed penalty appeals--for a handball by Kurt Zouma and foul by Mame Diouf .\" We don't get penalties, we know that, \"said Wenger .\" I can get the numbers you will see. Look at the statistics. We had the highest penalties against us at home by a mile and the lowest number for us. \"To add to the manager's bad mood, he also saw a second half\" equaliser \"by record signing Alexandre Lacazette ruled out for offside--a decision by referee Andre Marriner which television replays suggested had been correct by a matter of millimetres .\" I watched it, it's not offside at all, \"said Wenger .\" Even his foot was not offside but we have to swallow that. \"We should have scored and it's just another detail that didn't go our way .\" Among many disappointing Arsenal performances, German international Mesut Ozil was particularly underwhelming, with television pundits picking him out for special attention, although Wenger would not criticise him. \"I think he did try,\" said the manager. \"It is difficult to single anybody out. Personally, I don't think he deserved it .\" Wenger also confirmed that Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez, who trained with the team in London on Friday, will be available for their next game, Sunday's visit to Liverpool, after being linked with a potential move away from the club. Tottenham Hotspur pay club record \u00a3 42m to Ajax for Colombian defender Davinson Sanchez But, in the meantime, having conceded three goals in the opening weekend victory over Leicester, Wenger insists he is not panicking about his team in that area. \"Last week we conceded two goals from corners,\" he said. \"They only had three shots on goal so I don't think defended so badly--on set-pieces, yes .\" Today, the goal we conceded we were 100 per cent guilty but it was the kind of night when, not only we didn't score, but stupid mistakes--first by losing the ball centrally and then by defending poorly--cost us. \"Meanwhile, Stoke manager <mark>Mark Hughes</mark> believes his new signing Jese will set the Premier League alight after his debut goal came on the back of a solitary training session with his new club. The 24-year-old Spaniard had also missed an entire week's training before arriving in Stoke due to a family illness. Liverpool reject \u00a3 114m Barcelona bid for Philippe Coutinho\" He's an elite player, \"said <mark>Hughes</mark>.\" A player that can change games for teams, I'm delighted he's here. \"Everybody has seen what he is going to bring to Stoke and bring to the Premier League. We're glad he's in our colours because he's going to light up the Premier League .\" I saw glimpses of that in training and knew if we could get him on the pitch and give him some minutes he would have opportunities to show what he can do. He can be devastating. \"He's not up to speed yet. He's only had one significant training session and missed a week's training last week because his new-born child had a minor operation .\" But he came in and wanted to make an impression and really enjoyed his first taste of the Premier League. \"SCMP Today: HK Edition", "articleID": "2017082005_00545126_W", "names": {"Mark Hughes": ["Q1494363", "Q214513", "Q21516094", "Q3294110", "Q33676880", "Q39073279", "Q58235929", "Q6768131", "Q6768132", "Q6768133", "Q6768134", "Q6768135", "Q6768136", "Q6768137"]}}, {"date": "2017-08-20", "url": "http://chatsports.com/mma/a/source/terence-crawford-plans-to-move-up-to-147-wants-jeff-horn-manny-pacquiao-2-winner-13791600", "content": "<mark>Terence Crawford</mark> plans to move up to 147, wants Jeff Horn-Manny Pacquiao 2 winner Related Topics: <mark>Terence Crawford</mark>, Manny Pacquiao, Keith Thurman <mark>Terence Crawford</mark> (32-0, 23 KOs) became the first man since Kostya Tszyu * to unify all major championship belts at junior welterweight, and unlike Tszyu, he did so under the four-belt era (with the WBO becoming a major title in 2007). <mark>Crawford</mark> stopped Julius Indongo (22-1, 11 KOs) with a debilitating body shot in the third round of Saturday's Top Rank on ESPN main event in Lincoln, Nebraska.

But his parents Mark and Lynne Kelsall were there to support him almost two-and-a-half years after he was sentenced to a minimum 30 years behind bars for stabbing Morgan Huxley 28 times in his Neutral Bay unit.

Kacper Pempel/Illustration/Files LONDON (Reuters) - Online abuse will be treated as seriously as offline offences, Britain's prosecution service said on Monday in new guidance on handling hate crimes. The rules - which included guidelines on helping disabled and bisexual victims - were meant to encourage more people to come forward and press courts to impose longer sentences, the Crown Prosecution Service said. \"This is a crime that's under-reported. Sometimes people feel that they just have to put up with it...That's absolutely not the case,\" Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, told the BBC. The new advice was in response to the growth of social media, the CPS said. There have been several high-profile instances of successful prosecutions of people who had abused lawmakers and other public figures online.
