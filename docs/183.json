The USA international, who celebrated his 23rdbirthday last week, has put pen to paper on a deal which will extend this stay on Wearside until at least 2022. Gooch has progressed through the ranks at the Stadium of Light since joining six years ago, making his first-team debut in 2015 in the League Cup against Exeter City. He has now become an integral part of the first-team squad, making 57 league appearances in the last three seasons. He has already notched five goals and provided seven assists in League One, making him one of the league's most productive players. Gooch said: \"I am glad to get it all done because the manager has given me a lot of opportunities. He has shown faith in me when I haven't been playing well at times, but I'm delighted to be in this first team and playing because that's the most important thing at my age.\" The club has completely changed since the summer and the manager was a big reason for me wanting to stay. \"He has had a big impact on me this season and given me the license to do what I do best. Hopefully I can continue to show the form I have done in the first-half of the season and help us get promoted.\" Sunderland boss <mark>Ross</mark> said: \"Lynden's contribution to the season has been evident in terms of his form and what he has given us with goals and assists. I hope it is a reflection of how young players see the club, as a platform for them to progress their career.\" Lynden can get to where he wants in the game with us, so we're delighted, and I'm delighted for him because I've forged a close relationship with him in a short period of time. \"His hard work has been rewarded and hopefully now he can be a big part in the club's future as well.\" 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2019120502_01295754_W", "names": {"Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"]}, "date": "2019-12-05", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/?system=3ds&sid=9ce0e3f8e1d233b69dc109bb4450e466", "content": "3DS Catch all the news from the world of competitive gaming, as well as the latest details about Gamereactor's own CS: GO League.

Giroud has not played since the end of August when he suffered a broken tibia in the 2-2 draw with Everton, having scored minutes before the injury to salvage a point for the Gunners. The French striker's absence led to Wenger making a deadline day move for Danny Welbeck, with the England international joining the North London club from United for \u00a3 16m. Arsenal's injury list Ahead of the game against their fierce rivals, Wenger revealed that both Giroud and club captain Mikel Arteta are available after injury, and there was also positive news regarding the progress of defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny. \"Giroud and Arteta are both available,\" Wenger told www.arsenal.com. \"It's just a question of how ready they are. But they are available. Olivier Giroud is back in training\" He [Giroud] is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year. So he's one month ahead. \"Koscielny and Debuchy are doing well, they are out on the field [working] again. We have to see now. Usually field work is three weeks away from full group training. Then there is fitness. It looks straightforward for Debuchy. It's not inflammation, it's just repairing surgery. For Koscielny, it depends how well he responds to training. At the moment he looks good.\" Wenger defends Ozil and Diaby Wenger added that both Welbeck and \u00a3 35m Alexis Sanchez have helped the Gunners deal with the absence of their lead striker, but stressed that the return of both the France international and a fit-again Theo Walcott. When asked if they had relied on Welbeck, Wenger said: \"Yes, and on Sanchez as well. But we have Giroud back, we have Walcott back. Slowly they <mark>will</mark> integrate into the team again and give us different options. Welbeck has scored five goals since joining Arsenal Finally, Wenger gave a brief update on injured midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury sustained in the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea.

Photo: Hamish Hooper/ETNZ There are fears the fleet of America's Cup catamarans may pose a threat to local sea life in Bermuda. Conservation groups in Bermuda are rounding up sea turtles on the Great Sound ahead of the regatta opening on May 27. The incoming fleet of catamarans, which are capable of speeds up to 50 knots, could potentially harm the sea turtles. To protect their numbers, the local authorities are temporarily relocating them to a purpose-built ocean enclosure near the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo. Their relocation will have a low impact on other species, according to a Bermuda Government press release issued to the Royal Gazette. A collision with a sea turtle could also have a potentially devastating impact on a team's campaign. Softbank Team Japan skipper <mark>Dean Barker</mark> told the Royal Gazette last month there were concerns the hard shells of the turtles could seriously damage some of the most expensive items on the multi-million dollar catamarans - their razor-edged foils and rudders. \"We've seen a lot of turtles and other debris out there and we try to avoid them wherever possible. You can't engineer daggerboards or rudders strong enough to withstand hitting something like that. It is a concern.\" Continued below. Collection of the turtles already underway in advance of the America's Cup qualifiers later this month; by July the turtles will be back in the same area where they were originally located. The operation is being carried out by America's Cup Bermuda (ACBDA), the Ministry of the Environment and relevant environmental organisations. Mike Winfield, CEO of the ACBDA, said in a statement: \"There will be a vastly increased level of marine traffic in the Great Sound in late May and June.\" We began and continue with the objective of capturing the turtles safely, looking after them during the enhanced traffic volume period and then returning them to their habitats. \"<mark>Ian Walker</mark>, principal curator of the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo, said the ACBDA came to the scientific community expressing concern about the level of marine traffic in the Great Sound in May and June and asking for assistance in minimising the risks this could present to marine wildlife.\" Working with local sea turtle experts, the team collectively developed a plan to capture and relocate these animals in late May and June which is expected to reduce the risk to animals while keeping them in a safe and humane manner. \"Share this article SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google + Email"}, {"articleID": "2020021316_00267755_W", "names": {"Chris Phillips": ["Q1077658", "Q15994688", "Q48516835", "Q5107750", "Q5107753", "Q55119851"]}, "date": "2020-02-13", "url": "http://basildonrecorder.co.uk/news/18234023.nile-ranger-unfinished-business-southend-united-honestly-play-nothing/", "content": "News Nile Ranger: I have unfinished business with Southend United, I'll honestly play for nothing By <mark>Chris Phillips</mark> @ cjphillips1982 Chief sports reporter Wanting a return - Nile Ranger is keen to come back to Southend United 0 comment NILE Ranger is willing to return to Southend United for free.

The centre back spent half a season with the Imps on loan before signing for the U's in 2018. It gave him a good idea of the approach instilled by the management team of Danny and Nicky Cowley. And while the highly-rated pair have moved on to Huddersfield Town, caretaker boss Jamie McCombe was also part of the coaching staff during Dickie's tenure. He said: \"The Cowleys were so competitive and just wanted winners in the club.\" Although they've recently left I know they would have signed very competitive players with a winning mentality. Also read: Oxford United trio return to training today ahead of Lincoln City trip \"Jamie McCombe is taking care of them for now and he worked very closely with them.\" I'm sure he'll be using the same messages they were. I know they will be on it and it will be a very competitive team. \"They like to use their fans as the 12th man and their set pieces are definitely a threat we'll look at.\" It will be a very difficult task for us, but one we're definitely up to. \"Former U's boss Michael Appleton remains the overwhelming favourite to take over, but McCombe said yesterday he was expecting to be in charge for tomorrow's clash. Dickie has been one of United's best performers this season. But their 17th place in the Sky Bet League One table means the 23-year-old cannot take much pleasure. He said:\" I don't think I'll ever be satisfied. \"I'm happy with how it started, but I'm not happy with the results.

United would move to within a point of their hosts if they can claim a first away success of the campaign. And after a goalless draw at Bolton Wanderers on Tuesday, the visitors will be hungry to deliver. Dickie said: \"You can go into games sometimes feeling too comfortable if you're on the back of two good results.\" We take things from every game into the next one to make us stronger. \"0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2017071707_00280157_W", "names": {"Jerry Brown": ["Q152451", "Q717620"], "Clint Eastwood": ["Q2979323", "Q43203"], "Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"]}, "date": "2017-07-17", "url": "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/us-politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-cap-trade-jerry-brown-20170717-story.html#nt=oft11aH-22li2", "content": "\"He's single-minded like a bull,\" said a close friend of Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark>. That was more than 42 years ago. Another Times reporter and I had tracked down friends and relatives of <mark>Brown</mark>, looking for some insight into the young man about to be inaugurated California governor for the first time. The single-minded bull description came from Frank Damrell, a former college roommate of <mark>Brown</mark> and a fellow Jesuit seminarian. He's now a retired U.S. district judge. The late Peter Finnegan, another longtime friend and fellow seminarian, said of <mark>Brown</mark>: \"I don't think he's a mystic. But I sure as hell think he's got a spiritual dimension that you don't find in politicians.\" Ironically, I had to cancel a luncheon with Damrell and some other old-timers last week because <mark>Brown</mark> simultaneously was doing his bull-spiritualist bit at a legislative committee hearing. It was too compelling to miss. Those old descriptions of <mark>Brown</mark> are as accurate today as they were in 1975. In fact, I've never seen <mark>Brown</mark> as animated, emotional and tenacious as he was before the state Senate Environmental Quality Committee, arguing for his embattled cap-and-trade climate control legislation. He resembled a cross between the <mark>Clint Eastwood</mark> character Walt Kowalski in \"Gran Torino\" --\"Get off my lawn!\" --and some street-corner preacher warning that the end is near. He's also the most effective politician Sacramento has seen in a very long time. \"I do get a little excited because, you know, as we get older we have less patience,\" the governor told the committee. \"And I want to see this thing get done.... Whatever I've got to do, I'm going to do it.\" \"This is the most important vote of your life,\" he continued, sounding a tad hyperbolic. \"Unless you think I'm lying. And I was in the seminary for three years, studying to be a good searcher of the truth. And I'm telling you, this is the truth.... And the only way I can be wrong is...if I'm stupid and ignorant, and I'm not. I've been around this business a long time.\" <mark>Brown</mark>'s hands were flying, arms flailing. Critics might say he was ranting. I'll just call it shouting. This isn't for me. I'm going to be dead. It's for you. And it's damn real .--Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark>, speaking about cap-and-trade legislation to fight climate change Very rarely does a governor testify before a legislative committee. Never do I recall one sitting at the witness table for four hours--sermonizing, listening intently, writing notes and--presumably--taking names. \"Climate change is real,\" he warned. \"It is a threat to organized human existence. Maybe not in my life. I'll be dead. What am I, 79? Do I have five years more? Do I have 10 years more, 15? I don't know, 20? I don't even know if I want that long.\" Then he dramatically turned around and faced the packed audience, something legislative witnesses never do. \"When I look out here,\" he said, \"a lot of you people are going to be alive. And you're going to be alive in a horrible situation. You're going to see mass migrations, vector diseases, forest fires, Southern California burning up. That's real, guys....\" So I'm not here about some cockamamie legacy that people talk about. This isn't for me. I'm going to be dead. It's for you. And it's damn real. \"<mark>Brown</mark> fights global warming with religious zeal. But it doesn't seem plausible that he's not concerned about his legacy, his place in history. That's perfectly human and acceptable. The governor relishes his role as arguably America's leading voice against climate change. He was ceded the mantle by President Trump when Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. Trump\" doesn't speak for the rest of America, \"<mark>Brown</mark> declared to foreign allies. The governor will hold his own international climate summit in San Francisco next summer. <mark>Brown</mark> wants California to show the world how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without ruining its economy. This state produces only 1% of the planet's emissions. So our cutbacks won't amount to a hill of beans. But we can create a successful model that could be copied everywhere and have a worldwide impact, the governor believes. Updates from Sacramento\" That would be through the cap-and-trade program. But if <mark>Brown</mark> can't get his legislation passed, it would be an embarrassing step backward. Here's another huge motivation for <mark>Brown</mark>: The cap-and-trade program has been keeping his bullet train project on life support. It receives 25% of cap-and-trade revenue. So far, it has totaled $800 million. Cap and trade works this way: A cap is imposed on an industry's greenhouse gas emissions. But companies can trade for--buy--extra permits to pollute, either from the state or private investors. Caps are gradually lowered and emissions reduced. This will be a crucial week for the legislation. It cleared the Senate committee on a party-line vote. The governor will attempt to push it through both houses before lawmakers adjourn for summer vacation Friday. There are two bills. AB 398 would extend cap and trade until 2030. It's slated to expire in 2020. AB 617 would tighten controls on air pollution. It's a close vote because <mark>Brown</mark> wants a two-thirds majority to guard against legal challenges. He's dealing, trying to entice Republicans. He has offered tax breaks for manufacturers and power companies, regulatory limits for oil refineries and repeal of a fire prevention fee hated by rural landowners. Environmentalists don't like it. Big business does. Republicans don't like Democrats. It's a vote-seller's market. The single-minded bull will need to use all his political skills. CAPTION Rep.

For every twist and turn the show has given us, fans have come up with millions more options for where the show could go. Fan theories have been known to get pretty wild, and it seems like the cast enjoys these ideas. During a recent interview with the U.K.'s Independent, Jeffrey Wright (<mark>Bernard Shaw</mark>) shared a particularly strange one he heard. \"One of the weirdest that I took in,\" he said, \"was the notion that because the weather never changes in\" Westworld' they must be in a biosphere underwater. \"As creative as the idea is, it apparently doesn't have any credence. Wright promptly debunked the theory, explaining,\" I was like, \"No dude, the weather doesn't change because we shoot in LA.'\" Fans aren't the only ones who come up with ideas about the show's secrets. Evan Rachel Wood (Dolores Abernathy) also spoke to the Independent and shared that she and her fellow \"Westworld\" actors got together during Season 2 and \"compared notes.\" Wood noted that \"part of the fun is figuring things out\" and thinks the audience will enjoy how complicated Season 2 is. \"I'm excited to hear the theories because I think there's going to be quite a lot of them,\" she said. The upcoming episodes will explore the aftermath of Season 1, which ended in a host revolt. Let's see if anyone can top the underwater biosphere idea. \"Westworld\" Season 2 premieres April 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on HBO.
