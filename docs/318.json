Your weather is set to comments Worcester seeks input for spending plan for federal funds \"There's 199 apartments here. That's bigger than a lot of neighborhoods .\" WORCESTER - City officials got an earful of complaints and suggestions from residents of Lincoln Park Towers Wednesday. The residents felt that their neighborhood had a number of strengths, ranging from easy access to stores, transportation and medical facilities, to a quiet atmosphere away from the city's bars and night-time hot-spots, to an inclusive atmosphere with a lot of activities for the largely elderly population. However, there were also a number of areas the residents hope to see improved, from the most local level, like the slow elevators and slamming doors in the tall apartment buildings and the need for a dog park, to more broad concerns, such as the construction of roads and bridges and better coordination of traffic and pedestrian signals. Some even raised concerns about \"troublemakers\" in the buildings and a desire for an increased police presence in the area. The comments came during one in a series of community forums aimed at getting input from residents to inform the city's five-year plan for spending federal Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). The goal, said <mark>Greg Baker</mark>, the city director of Neighborhood Development, is to explore the issues of importance to residents in different parts of the city. The comments will help the city craft its requests for federal funding and keep the government informed of the overall goals for Community Development Block Grants - which <mark>Baker</mark> said totaled some $4 million to $6 million per year. \"Your feedback is very important and we take it very seriously,\" he told the group of more than 20 residents. Ed Moynihan, chairman of the Community Development Advisory Committee, said that although the process can be cumbersome at times it really provides good, needed insights into what residents really want and need. \"That's one of the strengths of the program,\" Moynihan said of the CDBG's requirement to solicit community involvement. \"It does force people to listen and the process makes people feel involved in making improvements, which they are .\" He added, \"Hopefully we'll get a nice good cross section\" from the forum and the others like it in the series. Another four more community forums are scheduled before the end of the month. However, Moynihan noted that some of the concerns, like the complaints about the towers having only two elevators, were almost certainly outside of the scope of projects the grants are allowed to address. \"Still, it's a concern,\" he said. \"But it doesn't really make the cut .\" One resident, Randell Ormo, who lives in the towers, noted that although the facilitators were encouraging participants to think about their neighborhood, everyone present lived in the building.

(CNN)--Two police officers were shot dead in Mississippi late Saturday. It was the first time in 30 years that an officer was killed in the line of duty in Hattiesburg, the mayor said. Officers Benjamin J. Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 24, were making a traffic stop when they were shot, Mayor Johnny DuPree said. They were taken to a hospital, but did not survive. \"The men and women who go out every day to protect us, the men and women who go out every day to make sure that we are safe, were turned on tonight,\" DuPree said. Police have apprehended two suspects, Marvin Banks and Curtis Banks, he said. After the shooting, the suspects stole a police vehicle, which they used to flee. It was later found abandoned, according to CNN affiliate WDAM. The two men both have criminal records. Police also took a woman into custody who was with the suspects at the time of the shooting, WDAM reported. They have not said whether she was involved. DuPree told CNN a third suspect was taken into custody, but did not disclose the gender. Deen was named the city's officer of the year in 2012, according to The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi. Tate had recently graduated from the police academy. Deen leaves behind a wife and two children. Tate was not married and had no children, DuPree said. After visiting the crime scene, the mayor went to the hospital, where he tended to family members until early Sunday. \"You have to search for words you say to family members how much we love them; we are here to support them,\" he said. The city is making grief counselors available to the slain men's fellow officers. DuPree vowed that the perpetrators of the attack would face justice.

The agent suffered a concussion after the man pounded his head against a train car. In November 2016, Border Patrol agents discovered two illegal immigrants near a train that recently crossed the border from Mexico. One fled the scene. The other, Elias <mark>de Jesus</mark> Gregorio <mark>de</mark> Paz, a 21-year-old Guatemalan national, began fighting with one of the agents. During the fight, <mark>de</mark> Paz slammed the agent's head, neck, and body into the train causing the agent to lose consciousness, according to court documents. The illegal immigrant fled the scene and disappeared for a few days. Border Patrol agents encountered <mark>de</mark> Paz on November 22, 2016, and placed him in custody. The injured Border Patrol agent was transported to the hospital--doctors determined he suffered a concussion from the assault. <mark>De</mark> Paz pleaded guilty to assaulting the agent in federal court on March 9, 2017. On January 8, U.S. District Judge Alia Moses sentenced the Guatemalan national to five years in prison. He also ordered <mark>de</mark> Paz to pay $5,767.28 to the Border Patrol agent for restitution to cover medical expenses and lost wages. \"This case demonstrates the great sacrifice Border Patrol Agents make every day, often risking their lives to protect our nation. Violence against Border Patrol Agents will not be tolerated,\" San Antonio Division FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. To combat rising assaults against Border Patrol agents, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to increase the number of prosecutions. In a memo dated April 11, 2017, Sessions directed prosecutors to push for charges against anyone who assaults, resists, or impedes agents engaging in the performance of their official duties, Breitbart Texas reported. Despite this effort, assaults on Border Patrol agents continue to increase. During Fiscal Year 2017, assaults on Border Patrol agents increased by more than 70 percent over the prior year. A total of 786 agents were assaulted in 324 incidents over the period ending September 30, 2017. During the first two months of Fiscal Year 2018, 96 Border Patrol agents were assaulted in the line of duty. <mark>Bob Price</mark> serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

His comments were believed to be the first direct message ever issued by a North Korean leader. However, <mark>Kim</mark>'s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said North Korea could consider a hydrogen bomb test of an unprecedented scale on the Pacific Ocean, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Ri, who was talking to reporters in New York ahead of a planned address later this week, however also said he did not know <mark>Kim</mark>'s exact thoughts, according to the report. Japan, the only country ever to suffer an atomic attack, described the threat as \"totally unacceptable\". Trump said in his first address to the United Nations on Tuesday he would \"totally destroy\" North Korea, a country of 26 million people, if it threatened the United States and its allies, and called <mark>Kim</mark> a \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission. <mark>Kim</mark> said the North would consider the \"highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history\" against the United States and that Trump's comments had confirmed his own nuclear programme was \"the correct path\". Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a programme aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. \"I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire,\" <mark>Kim</mark> said in the statement carried by the KCNA state news agency, referring to Trump. \"SLEEPWALKING INTO WAR\" Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he could not recall such a statement in the first person, authored and signed by <mark>Kim</mark>. \"I don't think it's happened before. That's something to take seriously alone,\" he said. The escalating rhetoric came even as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for statesmanship to avoid \"sleepwalking\" into a war. South Korea, Russia and China all urged calm. Also Watch: However, the rhetoric was starting to rattle some in the international community. French Sports Minister Laura Flessel said France's team would not travel to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in South Korea if its security cannot be guaranteed. The 2018 Games are to be staged in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, the world's most heavily armed border. Asian stocks fell and the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained on the possibility of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan handed back earlier gains and was down 0.4 percent after falling 0.7 percent the previous day. MORE TIME In his sanctions announcement on Thursday, Trump stopped short of going after Pyongyang's biggest trading partner, China, praising as \"tremendous\" a move by its central bank ordering Chinese banks to stop doing business with North Korea. The additional sanctions on Pyongyang, including on its shipping and trade networks, showed that Trump was giving more time for economic pressures to weigh on North Korea after warning about the possibility of military action on Tuesday. Asked ahead of a lunch meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Thursday if diplomacy was still possible, Trump nodded and said: \"Why not?\" Trump said the new executive order on sanctions gives further authorities to target individual companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea. It \"will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind\" , Trump said. The U.S. Treasury Department now had authority to target those that conduct \"significant trade in goods, services or technology with North Korea\". Trump did not mention Pyongyang's oil trade. The White House said North Korea's energy, medical, mining, textiles, and transportation industries were among those targeted and that the U.S. Treasury could sanction anyone who owns, controls or operates a port of entry in North Korea. \"ON NOTICE\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said banks doing business in North Korea would not be allowed to also operate in the United States. \"Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea, but not both,\" Mnuchin said. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who addressed the U.N. General Assembly, said sanctions were needed to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table, but Seoul was not seeking North Korea's collapse. \"All of our endeavours are to prevent war from breaking out and maintain peace,\" Moon said in his speech. He warned the nuclear issue had to be managed stably so that \"accidental military clashes will not destroy peace\". The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

State Police said the fifth day of searching will entail going from house to house in Dannemora, where David Sweat and Richard Matt cut their way out of the Clinton Correctional Facility. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Other inmates at the state prison in Dannemora may have been in a position to see or at least hear two convicts making their escape using power tools to cut steel, break through bricks and slice open steam pipes. But in a world where snitching can get you killed, investigators ran all too predictably into a wall of silence. \"Nobody heard anything. Nobody saw anything,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said sarcastically this week about the questioning of inmates. \"They're all heavy sleepers .\" Prison experts and former inmates say breaking through that silence is tough but not impossible. And in a case as notorious as the weekend escape of two murderers from the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, investigators may be willing to make deals. \"There's certainly a group of people in every prison or every jail who are just waiting to be snitches,\" said University at Buffalo Law School professor Charles Ewing, a forensic psychologist. \"But it needs to be done very discreetly .\" A prisoner wanting to talk might send an anonymous note to the warden offering information that can be valuable currency behind bars. It could be traded for a favorable parole recommendation, dismissal of disciplinary measures, a transfer to a prison offering \"easier time,\" or something as simple as extra bedsheets. Indeed, investigators are wary of snitches who make up information just to get benefits or settle a score. But the code of silence can be so strong that any rewards authorities can offer may be outweighed by the dangers of being branded an informant. Investigators coming through a prison may well hear inmates yelling to each other from behind bars: \"Make sure you mind your business!\" said Ronald Day, a former New York inmate who is now a vice president of the Fortune Society, which helps ex-prisoners. The search for the escaped inmates entered a fifth day Wednesday, with law enforcement officers in helmets and body armor going door to door in the Dannemora area. The 170-year-old, 3,000-inmate prison has a particularly notorious reputation, singled out in a watchdog report last year for a higher rate of violence among inmates than most New York state prisons. State Assemblyman Daniel O'Donnell, who is chairman of the Corrections Committee and visited Clinton last September, said he was astounded by the accounts of violence from inmates. He said any inmate who might have heard the power tools used in the escape wouldn't dare say anything. \"Let me be clear: That will get you killed. That's the kind of environment it is,\" O'Donnell said. \"You can't expect people to behave like Catholic school monitors .\" While investigators try to protect their prison sources, Day said word of any informants on a case as big as this one is likely to leak out. It took New York City private investigator Joseph Barry three years to persuade a group of convicts at the Dannemora prison to sign statements clearing fellow inmate <mark>David Wong</mark> in a deadly prison-yard stabbing. Barry showed up repeatedly, seeking to catch the inmate witnesses by surprise and in private. Over time, more than 10 met with him behind bars. Some were promised parole recommendations, transfers or other benefits, he said. But the ultimate factor in getting them to come forward? The fact that the inmate they implicated in the stabbing had died and couldn't retaliate, Barry said. \"Because you can't be looking over your shoulder all the time,\" he said. 1 AACP lends supports to local leader accused of misrepresenting herself as black 2 Prison worker smuggled tools, other items to escaped inmates that may have aided their break-out 3 Ex-candidate pleads guilty in New Mexico topless video extortion case 4 Prosecutor: Slain mom, girl were witnesses against suspect"}, {"articleID": "2019062121_00299909_W", "names": {"Justin Ryan": ["Q40742189", "Q55590271"]}, "date": "2019-06-21", "url": "http://www.abc57.com/news/mayor-pete-skips-campaign-events-for-march-in-south-bend", "content": "Mayor Pete skips campaign events for march in South Bend email To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video NOW: Mayor Pete skips campaign events for march in South Bend NEXT: Historic tornado month in Indiana, Ohio, U.S.; another active...SOUTH BEND, Ind.--South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has cancelled a scheduled appearance in South Carolina Friday. Instead, the 2020 presidential candidate stayed in South Bend for a march for Eric Logan. Logan was killed by South Bend Police Sgt. <mark>Ryan</mark> O\u2019Neill early Sunday morning. Political analyst say the timing of the shooting puts Mayor Pete's campaign in a bind. \"The timing really couldn't be worse,\" said Jake Colwell, a political analyst. \"It was a lose-lose situation. There's no way have tried to continue on the campaign trail when something like that was happening in his city. During his campaign, Buttigieg has struggled gaining support among black voters. Friday's event in South Carolina would have afforded him a chance to garner support among a key Democratic constituency .\" Since the beginning of his campaign, we've seen at his campaign rallies, the struggle he's had to attract black voters, \"said <mark>Justin Ryan</mark> Gomez, 2020 Presidential Campaign Reporter/Producer for ABC News. As the fallout from this shooting continues, both Gomez and Colwell agree that it was imperative that Buttigieg be seen in the city trying to calm tensions, instead of campaigning .\" The optics would have been pretty bad had he decided to keep on campaigning and just manage this over the phone. In that kind of situation, I think it was very important that he was in South Bend and back at home to manage this from the ground, \"said Gomez. Share this article:"}]
