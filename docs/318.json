One place you won't be seeing them any time in the future, though, is Steam. In fact, Valve's <mark>Erik Johnson</mark> believes that while it would boost revenue, implementing ads in the Steam PC storefront would be detrimental to the whole platform. \"We don't see a case for that ever getting user value,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said in a GameSpot interview. \"I don't think that those ever work, either .\" <mark>Johnson</mark> went on to say that \"it would be a bad business decision, let alone just dumb\" to introduce ads to the storefront, believing it would ruin their customers' experience. This customer-oriented approach seems in-line with other recent company moves, such as Valve's promise to refund any games purchased on Steam. According to <mark>Johnson</mark>, the company would rather \"focus on long-term relationships .\" Valve's <mark>Robin Walker</mark> agreed, and re-iterated that one of the company's primary goals is to help users searching for games amidst all of the releases in their massive library. Indeed, Valve did prove their commitment to long-term relationships when they announced their partnership with GameStop and other retailers who plan to sell their hardware, which goes on sale in November.

Comments NEW YORK--Chris Christie was among the happy Mets fans exiting Citi Field after Game 1, still marveling at the dominant performance of starter <mark>Matt Harvey</mark> in a 4-2 victory over the Cubs, when he was asked if he would truly go all out to support his favorite baseball team in the NLCS. Coming to Citi Field on Sunday night for Game 2? That's a given. But what about on Tuesday night, when the series shifts to Chicago's famous Wrigley Field? Would the governor cut into a week of campaigning to take this show on the road? \"Probably not,\" he told NJ Advance Media as he made his way past the Mets clubhouse and out of the ballpark late Saturday night. \"I'm going to Iowa. I'll be close, but not close enough .\" It wouldn't have been the first time that Christie left the area to support one of his favorite teams. He flew to Green Bay to watch his beloved Cowboys lose a heartbreaker to the Packers at Lambeau Field last winter, and if anything, his Mets fandom is just as strong if not stronger. RELATED: <mark>Harvey</mark> was \"an animal\" in his memorable NLCS debut Christie told me a great story in 2010 about showing up at a book signing in Mendham--and, despite being governor, standing in line with everyone else until the organizers saw him--to meet Darryl Strawberry. \"In our house,\" Christie said then, \"it is absolutely mandatory that you're Mets fans. You're not allowed to be anything else .\" It's far too early to know what will happen in this series, but the 1-0 series lead means that the Mets could have a shot to clinch a World Series berth in Chicago.

(Nick Russett, UCF Image) ORLANDO, FLORIDA (UCF.EDU)--Computers have scanned aerial photographs and conducted the first automated mass-crowd count in the world, thanks to the work of researchers at the University of Central Florida. Counting large-scale crowds (such as the Million Man March in Washington, D.C.) has been a long, tedious process involving people examining aerial photographs one at a time. Until now, each photograph had to be divided into sections and the examiners counted the number of heads per inch. But now, UCF's Center for Research in Computer Vision has created software that promises to automate the process and cut down the time dramatically, from up to a week to 30 minutes, giving organizers critical information when planning for events or responding to emergencies. UCF's test run was conducted in September. Thousands of demonstrators along a 3.2-mile stretch of Barcelona were calling for the independence of the Catalonia province from Spain. Using the new software, 67 aerial images of different sections were analyzed. Related Story: UCF To Conduct National Search For Athletic Director After O\u2019Leary Stepped Down The software program came up with a total count for each of the images within 30 minutes. The images and calculations were then sent to Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, where statistics professor Albert Satorra led a team in reviewing the data. Using UCF results for the images, they concluded the count for the entire crowd at about 530,000. That number is well below the count claimed by rally organizers, said Haroon Idrees, a post-doctoral associate at the UCF center who conducted the analysis that was sent to Satorra. <mark>Mubarak Shah</mark> \"Automated computer analysis of such large-scale and dense crowds has never been done before,\" said <mark>Mubarak Shah</mark>, computer science professor and director of the center. \"We will continue to push the envelope of state-of-the-art in-crowd analysis so that it can by help the authorities and governments manage real-time safety of large crowds and perform post-event analysis of such gatherings .\" Crowd counts have been done digitally before, but not for large-scale crowds involving hundreds of thousands of people. The discipline is important because knowing the size of crowds can help organizers plan for events and can also help them have appropriate staffing available for emergencies. Dinesh Manocha \"This is a huge milestone in how mass crowds are counted,\" said Dinesh Manocha, a computer science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not involved in the project. \"UCF's computer-vision program has been the leading research group on developing computer-vision techniques for analysis of crowd videos and their research can have significant impact in terms of development of next-generation crowd-management technologies .\" ", "articleID": "2015101918_00043987_W", "names": {"Mubarak Shah": ["Q28036606", "Q5412180"]}}, {"date": "2015-10-20", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/10/19/driver-swerves-hits-motorcyclist_n_8335616.html", "content": "Texas Driver Slams Into Motorcyclist, Then Says' I Don't Care' Motorist now facing charges of aggravated assault. Ed MazzaOvernight Editor, The Huffington PostPosted: 10/20/2015 03:56 AM EDT A driver was caught on video swerving into a motorcyclist, hitting the bike and knocking both the biker and his passenger onto the ground at high speeds in Texas on Saturday. Motorcyclist <mark>Eric Sanders</mark> suffered a cut on his arm and road burn in the crash. \"I've got a gouge in my elbow that is bone-deep,\" <mark>Sanders</mark> told WFAA, the ABC station in Dallas. His passenger, Debra Simpson, had to be airlifted to a hospital, where she was initially placed in intensive care. She suffered a broken wrist with deep arm lacerations, according to CBS DFW, but was transferred to a regular room on Monday. She is now in stable condition. When confronted about the incident, the motorist who hit them had just three words to say, all of which were caught on the video: \"I don't care .\" \"That's the worst thing, when I saw that dude saying,' I don't care, I don't care .' He says it four to five times,\" <mark>Sanders</mark> told WFAA. \"I've never seen this guy in my life. And he ran me over .\" Driver William Crum, 68, was charged on Monday with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to The Associated Press. Each count has a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Footage recorded by another rider shows <mark>Sanders</mark> crossing the double-yellow line to pass Crum on a two-lane road in Granbury, about 70 miles from Dallas. Crum then swerves, hitting <mark>Sanders</mark>: After saying \"I don't care\" several times, Crum claims that he was stung by a wasp. He later told CBS DFW that he was bitten by a spider. \"It bit me right in the tendon, so right now I have a tendon that's hurting if I stand. If I walk off I'll limp,\" Crum said. Crum told WFAA he wished he could \"go back in time,\" but also indicated that while he'd apologize to the passenger, he had no apologies for <mark>Sanders</mark> \"because he was doing something illegal\" in trying to pass him. WFAA reports that <mark>Sanders</mark> was also cited for passing in a no-passing zone and driving with an invalid license. However, <mark>Sanders</mark> wrote on Facebook that he tried to pass despite the double yellow line because Crum had slowed to about 40 mph on a road where the speed limit was either 60 or 65 mph. While he's been getting plenty of messages of support, <mark>Sanders</mark> has also heard from some who blame him for the incident. \"I'm glad your woman lived,\" someone wrote to him in a post shared on Facebook. \"It's too bad you did .\" <mark>Sanders</mark> has set up a GoFundMe page, saying he and his girlfriend will be out of work for several weeks as a result of the accident.", "articleID": "2015102009_00003400_W", "names": {"Eric Sanders": ["Q3731522", "Q5387430", "Q5387431"]}}]
