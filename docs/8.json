a lot of eyes watching you, both individually and as a team .\" pennington received 19 of 50 votes from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the league. that was 13 more than quarterbacks kerry collins of tennessee and jake delhomme of carolina. another quarterback, arizona's kurt warner, received four votes, as did his teammate, wide receiver anquan boldin. top defensive rookie. new england linebacker jerod mayo won the ap's award for nfl defensive rookie of the year. mayo was a nearly unanimous choice, receiving 49 of the 50 votes. mayo led the patriots with 139 tackles, according to their coaches' calculations after reviewing game tapes. he singled out veteran tedy bruschi for his guidance. \"i had heard horror stories about coming in as a rookie - guys really wouldn't help you,\" mayo said. \"i came into the patriots organization thinking the worst - that these guys weren't going to help me, and they aren't going to want me to play, but it was the exact opposite .\" the only other defensive rookie to get a vote was cincinnati bengals linebacker keith rivers. mayo was the 10th pick in the first round, one pick behind rivers. broncos. a day after firing <mark>mike shanahan</mark>, team owner pat bowlen gave no timetable for hiring the coach's replacement. bowlen said he dismissed <mark>shanahan</mark> after 14 seasons because he thought it was time for a change. he said he had not compiled a short list of candidates. <mark>shanahan</mark> said he was interested in coaching again but had not taken any phone calls about openings. he also was the broncos' executive vice president of football operations. former broncos quarterback john elway, a hall of famer, has been mentioned as a possible part of the management team that would replace <mark>shanahan</mark> in the front office. cowboys. dallas fired special-teams coach bruce read, making him the first assistant ousted after a disappointing 9-7 season. read spent two years with the cowboys under coach wade phillips, who will return next season, according to owner <mark>jerry jones</mark>. jets. new york giants defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo will interview saturday for the new york jets head coaching vacancy, created two days ago with the firing of eric mangini. jets assistants brian schottenheimer and <mark>bill callahan</mark>, a former nfl head coach, will interview with the team a day earlier, spokesman bruce speight said in an e-mail. the team also has received permission to talk to baltimore defensive coordinator rex ryan, although no date for an interview has been set. chargers. a year after pushing his injured knee a little too hard in practice and then paying for it during the afc championship game, ladainian tomlinson plans to be more cautious about his groin injury going into saturday's home playoff game against the indianapolis colts. tomlinson, who scored three tds on sunday, sat out practice yesterday and plans to take it easy today. because your contributions are currently under review, no comments can be made at this time. philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations. please treat other participants with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated. you are responsible for what you say. and please, stay on topic. if you see an objectionable post, please report it to us using the \"report abuse\" button. about your comments: these comments are monitored by philly.com staff. we reserve the right at all times to remove any information or materials that are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable. personal attacks, especially on other participants, are not permitted. we reserve the right to permanently block any user who violates these terms and conditions. venue search: -

(five percent of voters called themselves conservative democrats and only 1 percent called themselves liberal republicans, who, sadly, are a dying breed .) thus, when democrats try to broaden their appeal, they are also addressing middle-of-the-road voters in their own party. republicans who want to reach out have to fight their party, which is overwhelmingly inclined to stick with the true conservative faith. republicans would do well to pay attention to another trend: the young are leaning left. voters under 30, according to the exit poll, are the only age group in which liberals outnumber conservatives, by a margin of 32 percent to 26 percent. and the last four years of the <mark>bush</mark> presidency clearly turned this generation off to the gop. in 2004, 18 - to 29-year-olds tilted only narrowly democratic, 37 percent to 35 percent. in 2008, 45 percent of the under-30s called themselves democrats; only 26 percent called themselves republican. right-wing loyalists can talk all they want about how president <mark>bush</mark>'s problem was that he wasn't \"conservative enough,\" but the numbers show they are misunderstanding their party's problem. obama and kaine are appealing to a moderate country moving gradually in a progressive direction, and have a party behind them prepared to grapple with the realities of politics now. whoever takes the helm of the gop will have to persuade a very conservative following that we are not living in ronald reagan's america anymore. e.j. dionne's e-mail address is postchat (at) aol.com. posts by unregistered readers are moderated. posts by members are you a human? retype the word you see here. a progressive journal of news and opinion. editor, robert scheer. publisher, zuade kaufman.", "articleID": "2009010609_00009953_W", "names": {"Jon Cohen": ["Q15069805", "Q16728126", "Q6270512"], "Mark Warner": ["Q14949474", "Q1617921", "Q21166633", "Q453893", "Q51299121", "Q6770231"], "Michael Steele": ["Q331838", "Q443813", "Q51709680"], "Mike Duncan": ["Q16207428", "Q361250"], "President Bush": ["Q207", "Q23505"]}}, {"date": "2009-01-07", "url": "http://politics.co.uk/news//opinion-former-index/legal-and-constitutional/party-leaders-on-uk-tour-$1258822.htm", "content": "both party leaders will be touring the uk this week <mark>gordon brown</mark> and <mark>david cameron</mark> have both begun tours of recession-struck britain in a move unheard of outside election season. both men are using the trips to unveil competing proposals in a bid to convince the public they have the answer to the economic crisis. \"i can't honestly think of another prime minister who has done this outside of an election period,\" said one downing street aide. <mark>brown</mark>'s extensive tour of meet-and-greets will start in the east midlands today before a cabinet meeting in liverpool on thursday in front of 200 representative members of the public. the pm will then set off for the north-west and west midlands. the trip ends on friday in south wales. the government is keen to portray the unusual schedule of visits as part of an overall package to help reassure the public during the downturn. junior government minister <mark>ivan lewis</mark> said: \"this is the first time that a government is saying there is something they can do about a recession. when times are hard people want government who are on their side, not standing to one side .\" opposition mps suspect that the trip is more of an attempt to drum home policy and \"warm up\" labour heartlands in advance of a general election. mr <mark>cameron</mark> has also embarked on a series of speeches at events across the country revealing the conservative party's economic alternatives to <mark>brown</mark>'s plans. the child death toll in gaza has today topped 100, with conservative estimates putting it at 101 dead children since fighting began 11 days ago. bmf: london's bus lane access for motorcycles - the key to universal access say bmf diabetes uk: diabetes alert - one person diagnosed every three minutes in the uk politics.co.uk's new jobs section, for government, public sector and public affairs roles.", "articleID": "2009010709_00013557_W", "names": {"David Cameron": ["Q1173911", "Q16195447", "Q18719363", "Q192", "Q47345547", "Q51808902", "Q5232111"]}}]
