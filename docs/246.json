Just two-thirds of these pupils are meeting the expected level in terms of numeracy. New data on pupil achievement was published at the same time as union leaders complained about the \"growing teacher recruitment and retention crisis\" in Scotland's classrooms. Scottish Government statistics showed schools employed the full-time equivalent (FTE) of 51,138 teachers The total of 24,899 FTE primary teachers is the highest since 1980, the government said. Overall teacher numbers, including those working in early learning and childcare centres, are the largest they have been since 2010 at 51,959. As a result, the teacher workforce in 2018 is 447 higher than it was the previous year. Teacher levels are high and our schools have never been in better condition.

The pupil-teacher ratio in schools was unchanged from 2017 at 13.6 with the average primary school class size also remaining the same at 23.5 children. Separate figures showed 70% of P7 pupils across Scotland in 2017-18 were meeting the expected standard in literacy, with 75% achieving this for numeracy. In the most deprived parts of Scotland in 2017-18, just 59% of P7 pupils met the expected standards in literacy, compared to 83% in the most affluent communities. Meanwhile, two-thirds (66%) of P7 pupils in the poorest areas achieved the expected standards for numeracy, 20 points lower than the 86% who did so in the least deprived areas.

While 85% of P1 children met the expected standards for numeracy, this fell to 76% for P4 pupils and 75% for those in P7. Three-quarters (75%) of P1 pupils were at the expected level in terms of literacy but this fell to 69% for P4 before increasing slightly to 70% for P7 youngsters. In S3, 95% of students from the least deprived areas met the expected standards under Curriculum for Education for literacy, compared to 81% of youngsters from the most deprived areas. The situation for numeracy was similar, with 96% of those from the least deprived areas reaching the expected standards, compared to 82% of those from the poorest areas. Some encouraging signs in the latest CfE statistics--and important to acknowledge them--but there are some big worries too, the persistence of the attainment gap being one .--<mark>Liz Smith</mark> (@ MspLiz) December 11, 2018 Education Secretary John Swinney said he was \"encouraged to see the attainment gap has also narrowed slightly\" . He said: \"There is an increased proportion of primary pupils assessed as achieving the expected levels of Curriculum for Excellence by up to four percentage points.\" This coincides with the first year of our \u00a3 120 million Pupil Equity Fund. \"While it is too early to draw direct conclusions from this data, I am encouraged to see the attainment gap has also narrowed slightly.\" He added: \"Teacher levels are the highest this decade and the number of primary teachers is the highest since 1980.\" The average size of primary one classes has been dropping consistently in recent years, which is particularly important as helping children in the early years is crucial if we are to close the attainment gap between the most and least deprived. \"The figures also show 86.6% of school buildings were in a good or satisfactory condition in April 2018, up from 81.7% in April 2012.\" For the first time, more than 600,000 pupils are educated in schools classed as good or satisfactory condition, \"Mr Swinney said.

He said:\" This is a consequence of 3,000 fewer teachers under the SNP and \u00a3 400 million slashed from schools since 2010. \"SNP ministers claim that education is the top priority--these figures show that the poorest young people are being failed badly.\" While the SNP pledged children in the first three years of primary would be taught in classes of 18 students or less, Liberal Democrat education spokesman Tavish Scott said this was being achieved for just 12% of youngsters \"These figures show that the SNP Government deserves an F for the delivery of its flagship class size policies,\" said. \"It is symbolic of their failures in education.

Contents [show] Biography Edit Khaliset served the Order by gathering silica for them in the ancient tombs of Giza, as silica had special properties and could be used to power the Isu technology the Order sought. [1] Eventually, however, she went rogue and began keeping the silica for herself, prompting Taharqa, a fellow member known as The Scarab, to write her a letter questioning her lack of contact with them. At some point, she had begun to study the ancient symbols in the Isu vault beneath Khufu's Pyramid and began to learn how to use the technology for her ultimate purpose of resurrecting her deceased daughter Eshe. [2] [3] In 48 BCE, the Medjay, Bayek, tracked Khaliset to the Great Pyramid of Giza, where he found the Isu Temple, Eshe's sarcophagus, and evidence of Khaliset's attempts to resurrect her, before Khaliset herself appeared, furious that Bayek had disturbed her daughter's \"tomb\" . He chased her through the pyramid's tunnels, eventually succeeding in killing her after a dramatic confrontation in the middle of a sandstorm outside the pyramid. [2] Personality and traits Edit Unlike most of the other members of the Order who sought power and dominance over Egypt, Khaliset was only determined to use the Order's resources to resurrect her daughter who died by unknown means. To that end, she was willing to commit many atrocities and sacrifice many innocents in deadly rituals that she believed would aid in her daughter's resurrection. She expressed remorse as she died, lamenting the fact she had been unable to protect her child in life or in death. [2] [3] Equipment and Skills Edit Khaliset was able to tame hyenas to do her bidding, and had several accompanying her wherever she went. Khaliset was also skilled with a bow as well as matters of stealth which she used to her advantage in combat during a sandstorm. [2] Trivia Edit Khaliset's place of origin and ethnicity was never mentioned in the game. Instead, they are listed in the Official Game Guide.

Some of the first strikes occurred in Australia, where an estimated 300,000 people took part in rallies across the country. Participants include Gina Hale, a student in Brisbane. Gina Hale: \"In school, I am learning about the effects of climate change, and I'm learning that we need to do something. Yet I'm seeing that the people in charge and the people who are running our country aren't doing anything. To me, this is confusing.

Here in New York, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired the movement, will take part in a large march this afternoon. Meanwhile, workers at Amazon, Microsoft and other large firms have also pledged to take part in today's strike.

Two Die in Texas as Storm Dumps 40 Inches of Rain on Houston Area Sep 20, 2019 At least two people have died in Texas after Tropical Depression Imelda dumped more than 40 inches of rain on the Houston area over three days. It's being described as one of the worst freshwater floods in U.S. history. More than 1,000 people had to be rescued on Thursday from the fast-rising waters. The storm also forced Exxon to shut down its massive oil refinery in Beaumont. In some areas, the floodwaters rose higher than during Hurricane Harvey two years ago.

Bird Population in U.S. & Canada Dropped by Nearly 3 Billion Since 1970 Sep 20, 2019 A shocking new study has found the United States and Canada have lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970, a 29% population drop. Researchers blamed numerous factors, including widespread habitat loss and the use of agricultural chemicals. Peter Marra of Georgetown University co-authored the report. Peter Marra:\" Birds are the quintessential ecosystem indicators. They are the canaries in the coal mine. When something's going wrong with birds, something's going wrong with the environment. It's just not healthy. And so, in this study, because we've seen so many declines across so many different types of birds, from warblers to thrushes to even house sparrows--these non-native species in urban areas are declining--that's not a good sign. That's an indication that something is really wrong with the environment. \"Benny Gantz Declares Victory, Rejects Overture from Netanyahu Sep 20, 2019 In news from the Middle East, Israel's former army chief Benny Gantz has declared victory over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after Monday's election.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau:\" The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot. \"Canadian New Democratic leader Jagmeet Singh responded to the growing scandal. Jagmeet Singh:\" I can tell you that I am deeply troubled by what this means to Canada, that young kids are going to see not just one or two, but multiple images of the prime minister mocking their lived reality. This is so hurtful to so many Canadians. \"Funeral Held in Afghanistan After U.S. Drone Strike Killed 30 Civilians, Mostly Farmers Sep 20, 2019 In Afghanistan, funeral services were held Thursday after a U.S. drone strike killed at least 30 civilians.

Local Afghan residents questioned why the U.S. would target innocent farmers. Ezatullah:\" These people had gone to the fields to work, and their wages were very low.

(2:31) comment Under-pressure Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has said any changes at the club will come in the summer. Zidane, whose side are 19 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona and have crashed out of the Copa del Rey, said he and his players were fully focused on improving their situation. On Wednesday, Madrid's campaign hit a new low with their Copa exit to Leganes, after which Zidane admitted his job was on the line over the next few weeks. The situation has brought speculation that Madrid president Florentino Perez may feel forced into a change before the team take on Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. But Zidane told a news conference: \"I talk all the time with the president, but I am continuing with the same motivation as ever.\" Tomorrow, we have a game to win three points [at Valencia]. Then we will see at the end [of the season] what will happen, whether things need to change, but not now. \"I feel the support of the club, the president, the squad, and we will keep going to turn things around.\" Zidane said he realised the success he enjoyed during his first two years in the job was now irrelevant and added: \"If I thought I could not [turn things around], I would leave tomorrow.\" In football, there are good and bad moments. I feel strong and able to resolve this. \"What I have won before...this is about today, I do not think about [the past]. I was very disappointed with the game the other day, I did not expect that. But that is part of football, we must accept it.\" Nobody can take from me the motivation to keep going, working, until the last day. \"Denis Doyle/Getty Images Zidane said that although the slump in form\" is not a typical situation for Madrid, \"it had happened before.\" It is not always nice moments all year, \"he added.\" We want to keep working hard and this will improve. We have played good games, we must do that more consistently. \"I am speaking of this for weeks now, that is true, but I am convinced we will turn it around and the players are convinced too, which is the most important.\" Asked whether he had regrets over last summer's transfer business, when experienced players such as Alvaro Morata, <mark>James Rodriguez</mark> and Pepe left, Zidane said he had faith in his youngsters. \"I would not change anything now,\" he added. \"This squad is what I have. I was happy with the squad before the season started. It is a younger squad, with future, which has to learn. But I am with them completely.\" Zidane confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo was available for Saturday's game despite a facial injury suffered while scoring his second goal in last weekend's 7-1 win over Deportivo La Coruna. \"We are ready to play a great game, and we will do that,\" he said. \"We know it is a difficult ground to visit, a very good team who have had a good season until now.\" But we like to play against the best teams, and we will play a good game tomorrow. \"The only thing that counts in football is to win. The only thing that will bring calm here is to win games, and we are all here to do that.\" "}, {"articleID": "2010021405_00026102_W", "names": {"Patrick Casey": ["Q19877723", "Q7146214", "Q7146216"], "John Law": ["Q16731294", "Q16866581", "Q16866744", "Q29643115", "Q6244134", "Q6244136", "Q6244142", "Q6244146", "Q645685"]}, "date": "2010-02-14", "url": "http://theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/534399.html", "content": "wheeling - officials with northwood health systems now have the option to file their lawsuit against gov. joe manchin for alleged political retaliation because the required 30-day notice has passed. northwood chairman of the board <mark>patrick casey</mark>, however, said the company would like to resolve the matter without going to trial in federal court. manchin's general counsel, jonathan deem, said the governor also wants to reach an agreement with northwood outside of court. northwood continues operating on its original license - it expired sept. 30 - because the office of health facility licensure and certification, a division of the west virginia department of health and human resources, has declined to renew the company's license. \"we will wait (to file the lawsuit), as long as we are making progress,\" <mark>casey</mark> said of the company's ongoing negotiations with state officials to acquire a new license. \"it is a long process and there are many issues to work through. but i am cautiously optimistic.\" <mark>casey</mark>, however, added, \"we are fully prepared to proceed with the suit\" when discussing northwood's options in the event the negotiations do not yield the company a new operating license. deem said manchin \"is hopeful that northwood reconsiders filing a lawsuit.\" \"the lawsuit is frivolous and would not advance the interests of northwood or its patients ....northwood has options outside of spurious litigation to address the health and safety issues that led to the loss of its provider's license,\" he said. northwood - an organization with about 450 employees serving more than 3,000 mental health patients in ohio, marshall and wetzel counties - in january filed its intention to sue manchin in wheeling's u.s. district court for the northern district of west virginia. the company alleges in its complaint that ohflac targeted the company because northwood supported a bill manchin opposed during the regular 2009 legislative session. ohflac found only five total violations at the 27 northwood facilities in all of 2007 and 2008, combined, but cited northwood for 175 deficiencies from february to november 2009. <mark>casey</mark> cites this increase as evidence manchin wants to shut down the company. northwood acknowledges ohflac's findings that three patients died in the company's care during a two month period last year. <mark>casey</mark>, however, believes those patients died from natural causes. manchin has flatly denied any involvement in the proceedings regarding northwood's license renewal. \"this is an absolutely irresponsible action by northwood and its attorneys. northwood should focus on what is truly important: the health, safety and welfare of its patients. their allegations against me are completely false and this lawsuit is an obvious attempt to divert attention from the serious health and safety concerns identified at some of northwood's facilities,\" the governor said in a statement. <mark>casey</mark>, however, believes the company's claims have merit. \"as a lawyer, i would never sign a document without believing i could support it,\" he said. northwood alleges manchin targeted them for supporting west virginia senate bill 672 - which would have provided more money for behavioral health care - during the 2009 legislative session. though the bill passed unanimously in both the senate and house of delegates, manchin vetoed the legislation. manchin, however, disputes such notions. \"northwood's suggestion that i would abuse government services to settle a political score is irresponsible,\" he said. while northwood continues negotiating with state officials to gain a new license, the company continues to operate. if ohflac does not renew northwood's license, the company's 3,000 mental health patients and 450 employees will need somewhere to go. \"if any center like northwood shuts down, the dhhr is responsible for working with the center on finding placement for their clients,\" dhhr spokesman <mark>john law</mark> said. <mark>law</mark>, however, declined to say if he believed the state could find placements for all of the clients, citing the fact that the matter is \"in litigation.\" <mark>casey</mark> hopes ohflac will grant the company a new license. \"it would be devastating for the northern panhandle,\" <mark>casey</mark> said of a possible northwood shutdown in the event the company cannot acquire a new license. west virginia delegate orphy klempa, d-ohio, said that he and other northern panhandle legislators \"have spoken to the governor about northwood.\" \"it is a huge concern for us, not only because of the service that northwood provides, but because of the 450 people who work there,\" klempa said. \"we need to hold onto all of these jobs.\" regarding how he believed the negotiations with state officials would go, <mark>casey</mark> said, \"i will have a better feel for it in two weeks.\" according to its \"prayer for relief\" in the court complaint, northwood wants to have its licenses fully restored; to ensure that \"retaliatory behavior by government officials\" stops; and to ensure that northwood is held to the same standards as those of similar health care providers. the intelligencer / wheeling news-register 1500 main st. | wheeling, wv 26003"}, {"articleID": "2017063015_00214817_W", "names": {"Martin Fowler": ["Q58417927", "Q6775467", "Q74894"], "Billy Mitchell": ["Q16732684", "Q18001525", "Q466532", "Q530431"]}, "date": "2017-06-30", "url": "http://eastenders.wikia.com/wiki/29_May_2017?diff=71796&oldid=0", "content": "Revision as of 14:13, June 30, 2017 (view source) Sonalsall (wall | contribs) (Created page with \"{{eastenders edit box information for episodes | title1 = 29 May 2017 | image1 = 29. jpg | caption1 = Whitney on the train, leaving Walford | air_date: = 29 May 2017 | writer = Gillian R.. .\" ) Newer edit \u2192 Revision as of 14:13, June 30, 2017 29 May 2017 Whitney on the train, leaving Walford Air Date: 29 May 2017 Writer Gillian Richmond Director John Dower \"Two residents are forced to face the reality of their actions.

nosing around, it's clear that size limits will be landed. that's not all. in 2010 national mandatory saltwater sportfishing reporting will begin. put your fingers to block your nostrils. this is the water on ice in creating the briny hawaii saltwater fishing license. hfn contacted the tuna tagging project's david itano, research associate at uh school of ocean and earth science and technology. itano confirmed the dar tuna limit talk: \"i attended a dar meeting last friday night on catch limits and bag limits. concentrating on weke, uhu and papio/ulua species. however, they did raise the ahi question.... basically there seems to be interest in raising the minimum size from many sectors but to what and how is the question.\" tuna size limits for hawaii is loudly controversial and as wanted as a poorly maintained 130 penn screaming with a tight drag ready to freeze up on a gorilla ahi. pounding against limits are kau kau sport fishermen and the near shore commercial guys. even with threats of maiming and misfortune neither throw back 45 pound tuna. traditionally, local fishermen are the apex predators for ahi. local politicians understand the food chain and until now dare not separate sashimi from chop sticks. this time it's different. enter the feds and they eat fish with fork and knives. noaa, the department of commerce agency charged with fish management, is changing the local fish politics playing field. noaa's marine recreational information program (mrip) is \"being phased in to.... provide a reliable, transparent, collaborative set of tools that managers, anglers and others can use to ensure sustainable fisheries and healthy oceans for generations to come.\" mrip is an expanded national marine creel survey. creel survey? you remember those awkward questions at the wash down ramps. lest we forget the lolo malihini telephone interviews from new hampshire about what's a \"marhee marhee?\" noaa realizes the dilemma of bureaucrats with fighting chairs behind desks. it wants better fishy field samples answers. who fishes? what's being caught? how many fish are caught? where and when are people fishing? it's fish catch data collection 101. mrips will \"fill survey data gaps, bias, consistency, accuracy, and timeliness.\" how prey tell? enter the national saltwater angler registry, \"providing a much more efficient and effective route for collecting data.\" all ocean states must register. but states that have a salt water fishing licensing program can be exempted. states without saltwater fishing licenses include connecticut, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, maine, massachusetts, rhode island, the western pacific, caribbean territories and hawaii. acceptable licensing or data collection programs get a memorandum of agreement with noaa. the memorandum allows states to share angler information required by the noaa's mrip registry. registry of what? noaa says that the national saltwater angler registry \"will be a\" phone book' of sport fishermen. \"beginning in 2010, people who live in states without such a program will have to sign up with the registry each year, and\" perhaps \"pay a fee. and\" perhaps \"postage stamps will go down in price? hawaii commercial fishermen already are exempted. they pay a mrip's qualifying license fee of $50 dollars to dar. hawaii commercial fishers face newly implemented stiff fines if they do not report fish catches monthly within 2 weeks of the month's end. having a hawaii commercial license signs you up to give up all rights against illegal search and seizure. by law a fee of $25 dollars can be charged by noaa for hawaii sport fishermen to register in the\" phone book. \"noaa doesn't want to get in the saltwater fishing license business. the state of hawaii has repeatedly proposed a fishing license only to be shot down by local politicians. this time for saltwater fishing licenses it's different. the state\" wen broke \"and local politicians can say:\" the feds made me do it. \"the only question left is where do i sign up? how about the question of whether fish size limits matter? we contacted <mark>dr.</mark> randy kochevar, science communications, at stanford's hopkins marine station. <mark>dr.</mark> kochevar, who is helping coordinate hibt's\" great marlin race, \"wrote hfn:\" i found.... some references you might find pertinent and useful to this topic. here you go: \"a j. bohnsack published in 2000, an article entitled\" a comparison of the short-term impacts of no-take marine reserves and minimum size limits. \"here's an exerpt:\" despite higher natural mortality for younger age classes, fishing mortality on juveniles can be particularly harmful to a fish population since the fish have not yet reproduced. this effect is compounded when quotas are based on weight since a larger number of fish are taken. \"similar size limit findings are found in the 2006\" bulletin of marine science \"article\" evolutionary regime shifts in age and size at maturation of exploited fish stocks. proceedings of the royal society b 273: 1873-1880. \"it was written by authors am de roos, ds boukal and l persson. <mark>dr.</mark> kochevar says of that article:\" there is ample evidence that fisheries management can affect the genetic composition, life history characteristics, and general biology of a population. these changes can quickly become irreversible (de roos et al. 2006). \"kochevar further writes that\" multiple studies suggest that minimum sizes in fisheries should be set at the age of maturation (smith and abramson 1990, purves et al. 2003, foster and vincent 2005). increased mortality of juveniles has been shown to select for later maturation and decreased reproductive potential (reznick et al. 1990, gardmark and dieckmann 2006). \"so there is a case for fish management size limits. will noaa implement them? noaa says that mrips\" will give saltwater anglers better representation in the policy-making process. \"looking to what has happened on the atlantic coast we see that the policy making process likes limits, permits and reports. according to the noaa office of sustainable fisheries, the recreational minimum size limit for atlantic bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin is 27 inches. size limits beget bag limits:\" regardless of the length of the trip, no more than 3 yellowfin tuna per person may be possessed on board a vessel. \"what about reporting? besides the fish license mandated reporting, for the atlantic there's recreational hotline reporting:\" within 24 hours of landing (killing and bringing to shore) any bluefin tuna, blue marlin, white marlin, swordfish, or sailfish that were caught in federal waters, recreational vessel owners must report the landing to noaa fisheries. call 1-800-894-5528. \"don't forget the highly migratory species permit.\" recreational vessel owners fishing for atlantic hms must hold a valid atlantic hms angling category permit for their vessel. \"how do you get a permit? just call the atlantic tunas information line at (888) 872-8862 or visit. all hawaii tunas, sharks, marlin, mahi mahi, ono, spearfish, sailfish are highly migratory species. in the atlantic skipjack tuna are not limited or permitted. mahi and ono will likely not be restricted in hawaii. it is only a matter of time before marlin and bigeye are restricted and likely yellowfin to follow. are you catching more or less aku? ask yourself if aku will ever have a size limit, bag limit or permit? don't have an aku answer? purse seine one up. one caveat for noaa is that hawaii's sportfishing tuna are easy to target and easier to manage than the world's biggest tuna catchers, the purse seiners. in 2007 224,000 tons of bigeye were caught, mostly by purse, in the pacific. hfn contacted <mark>dr. john</mark> hampton a tuna expert with the spc tuna program located in noumea, new caledonia. hampton and his agency are keepers of all commercial tuna data for the western and central pacific. he explained why purse seiner size limits won't work:\" a strict minimum size limit on bigeye (or other tunas) is unlikely to work because of the difficulty in separating the small bigeye from skipjack of the same size caught by purse seine (which is the main source of small bigeye tuna catch in the western and central pacific). even if they could be separated, it would be impossible to return them to the water alive after being caught by purse seine. thus far, there have been efforts to reduce the catch of juvenile bigeye by other means, such as reducing the reliance of the purse seine fishery on fads (which is how most of the bigeye is caught). there may also be other operational measures that could be effective. \"limits, permits and reports are nothing compared to tuna fishery closures brought on by purse seine over harvesting. tuna fishing in the eastern pacific, all nations on the entire pacific coast of latin america, will be banned for 59 days in 2009, 62 days in 2010 and 73 days in 2011. the closure is a directive of the inter-american tropical tuna commission (iattc). iattc is made up of 10 latin american nations and the united states, japan, spain, south korea, france and vanuatu. the united states means noaa. the eastern pacific tuna ban is\" to avoid the catastrophic collapse of valuable stocks of yellowfin (thunnus albacares), bigeye (thunnus obesus) and skipjack (katsuwonus pelamis) tuna. \"calls are already out for drastic measures for central and western pacific tuna including closures. noaa will license hawaii fishermen to collect the data to enforce the policy restrictions that follow worldwide collapsing tuna schools. what will the tuna size limit be in hawaii. david itano sheds some light:\" you probably know that dar has taken on l50 as their mantra in managing coral reef and bottomfish species and even have a big poster listing the l50 sizes of weke, omilu, paka, etc. \"what is l50? l50 is the measure, usually in terms of length in centimeters, at which half of the the estimated fish population sampled are sexually mature. the state is assuming that the l50 for tuna is 45 pounds. according to experts, l50 has some fish management problems like sexually maturity varies between males and females. l50 also varies from one one bio-region to another. yellowfin tuna have a different l50 when compared to eastern pacific, atlantic or australian yellowfin. itano relates this can be from different migration paths, local productivity and feed. in sum itano says:\" due to the population dynamics of tuna, l50 has never been used as a minimum size guideline for tuna species.... \"ahi will be likely regulated like atlantic tuna are. an example is the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas that states:\" contracting parties and co-operating non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities (cpcs) shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the catch, the retaining on board, landing and/or transshipment of any bluefin tuna (thunnus thynnus) weighing less than 10 kg in the mediterranean sea. \"this is 22 pounds in the mediterranean and 14 pounds in east atlantic and european waters. since noaa, not dar, rules pelagics and therefore tuna conservation in hawaii, they will mimic the atlantic regulations. the hawaii tuna size limit will be at 27 inches. this is an ahi weighing 14.7 pounds. this in from kona's joe dettling...tuna researcher and commercial fisherman.... j next post/next comment k previous post/previous comment"}, {"articleID": "2009080818_00028646_W", "names": {"Alexander Graham": ["Q27837152", "Q39072712", "Q43912899"]}, "date": "2009-08-08", "url": "http://redrabbitslife.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/i-heart-tommy-douglas/", "content": "red rabbit's life international health, life in the boonies, family doc stuff...musings of a resident in rural canada | 2009 august 8 i * heart * tommy douglas tommy douglas is widely hailed as the founder of public health in canada. premier of saskatchewan for more than 20 years, he was voted \"greatest canadian\" of all time by the canadian tv-viewing public, beating out <mark>alexander graham</mark> bell (inventor of the telephone), banting and best (discoverers of insulin), and of course jim carrey (vaccine-fearing nutjob and actor). canadian physicians were initially unimpressed and downright mistrustful of the overarching changes douglas proposed, and indeed, in his own province launched a campaign of misinformation and scare tactics to discredit the proposed programme. tommy douglas was surely no paragon, being a bible-thumping nazi sympathiser. but he did help bring about something of which the vast majority of canadians and canadian physicians are exceedingly proud. we are a nation which believes that a child getting appendicitis should not mean a family becoming homeless. we are a nation which believes that hospitals trump highways (and it shows). we value this about ourselves and about our country. obama is facing a massive amount of criticism from the right wing for trying to introduce universal medical insurance. the canadian example isn't the only way: the dutch are universally covered, as are the british, the australians, the french.... no system is perfect. but i like ours. to mr. obama: keep pushing. history will remember you well. \"no dress rehearsal, this is our life.\" sidney crosby is celebrating his 22nd birthday by bringing the stanley cup home to nova scotia. 2009 august 8 theoren fleury will attempt a comeback to the nhl, tsn reported on its website friday. 2009 august 7 immigration and wide-ranging entertainment choices are to blame for a waning interest in professional hockey by canadian teens, suggests research done in alberta. jeremy roenick officially ended a 20-year nhl playing career thursday, announcing his retirement in san jose. rabbit philosophy the only possible reason to turn 30 is so that you can do the things you weren't allowed to do when you were 8 \"when you hear hoofbeats, you really will need to think my human is making a cat toy with cat nip and it is not for me! it smells so good...i keep trying...my human is sitting in my chair and i want it back. ..."}]
