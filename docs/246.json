In popular areas along the Yonge subway line, even semi-detached homes are now selling for over $1 million, which is out of reach for most buyers. The reason that prices have risen so fast is that more and more people want to stay in Toronto to raise their families instead of moving to the suburbs. Toronto has become a world class city with great restaurants, unique cultural events, and neighbourhood festivals all over the city. Also, with commute times at a record high, many people who work in the city would rather live close to their work so they don't have to spend hours every day in a car or on a train. So what options are there for people with a budget under $1 million who still want a home in a desirable neighbourhood? I posed this question to former city councillor <mark>Adam Vaughan</mark>, who has long believed that an important part of Toronto's growth as a city includes families living near the downtown core. <mark>Vaughan</mark> cites a regulation for new condos mandating that at least 10 per cent of all units in new buildings have three bedrooms or more. \"10 years ago, people were calling me crazy for pushing this regulation, saying that families would never want to live downtown,\" says <mark>Vaughan</mark>. \"In hindsight, I think we will probably look back and think that the 10 per cent requirement was too low .\" The facts seem to back up <mark>Vaughan</mark>'s statement, as three bedroom condos and townhouses close to the downtown core are now selling faster than ever before. There are schools and daycares opening up in the bottom of large condo buildings, and lots of new parks and playgrounds are being built. Another option that many home owners are not aware of that many newer condo buildings have knockdown walls between units. This means that two or more suites could easily be combined into a larger suite by removing a non-structural mutual wall built in a way that makes it easy to remove. While this is a rare occurrence right now, it is a fascinating example of a policy that allows the market to dictate what type of properties exist in Toronto's downtown core. If families continue to choose to live in the city, then there will be more demand for larger units, and savvy investors will combine two smaller suites into a larger suite to meet demand. It could also be a great investment for buyers to purchase two units side by side and rent one out for several years until their lifestyle requires a larger property. Then they can combine the units together and have a space just as large as a single family home. These options may seem unconventional right now, but if house prices continue to grow anywhere near the current rate, we could see the location of knockdown walls become essential information in every property listing. All of this is good news for home buyers. As the popularity of these larger suites closer to downtown increases, it could make detached homes more affordable, creating more of a balanced market. These changes could be years away, but Toronto is well positioned to offer a variety of options for families wanting to live close to the downtown core.

(ABC: Justin Huntsdale) <mark>Clint Eastwood</mark> has heard all the jokes about his movie star namesake, but you probably haven't heard about how he hauled himself out of a darkness that was set to claim his life, and started training to be Australia's first triathlete on dialysis. \"At Christmas time, things were bad health-wise - I was living on pain killers, my conditions were flaring up and I couldn't walk so I was sleeping all the time and in a wheelchair .\" I decided after going through [over 30 years of] this horrible stuff, I'd finally had enough and it had just become too much. \"So he drove to Melbourne to tell his family that he was throwing in the towel after a long and difficult fight with kidney failure. Just one week away from his blood cleaning dialysis machine would've been enough to end his life .\" I got to Melbourne and no one wants to deal with stuff like that, I mean, how do you tell your own mother you don't want to be here anymore? \"On the cusp having that conversation, he says he had a\" light bulb moment' and realised that instead of quitting on life, he would seize what he calls his last throw of the dice. He chose to become a triathlete, inspired by reading the story of American dialysis patient Shad Ireland who did the same thing. \"Reading his story ignited a spark in me, then seeing stuff on Facebook of kids with no legs, blind athletes, and paralympians, I wondered what the hell am I whinging about?\" To be fair, he has a right to whinge. Diagnosed with kidney failure at age three, he's had three failed kidney transplants, was told a fourth would kill him, and was also told he wouldn't make 40 years of age. He has trouble finding employment because his dialysis treatment forces him to be connected to a machine that cleans his blood in a hospital, three days a week for five hours per session. \"I do it myself - it's like part time work but without the pay .\" But remarkably he still has a sense of humour about it all, and that's probably been enhanced with his fitness kick. He left Melbourne early and drove back to the Shoalhaven of southern New South Wales and signed up at a gym before he went home. \"I've lost 17.5 kilograms since January and people have noticed a physical and mental change in me,\" he says. \"You only live once and whether you have a long time or a short time, it's about making the most of the time you have .\" Stop wasting time and sitting there thinking woe is me and enjoy what you've got, particularly up here [in Wollongong]. \"He's at the gym several times a week (around his dialysis treatment), has started surfing and has received sponsorship from local businesses to help pay for his fitness equipment .\" All I'm trying to do is be proud of something I've done.", "articleID": "2014052913_00074808_W", "names": {"Clint Eastwood": ["Q2979323", "Q43203"]}}, {"date": "2014-05-29", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2014/05/you_be_the_gm_trail_blazers_center_victor_claver.html", "content": "Set Your Location (Enter City and State or Zip Code) Congratulations!

Clippers...Scored a career high 13 points on 5-for-7 shooting on Feb. 26 vs. Brooklyn...Recorded five points and five rebounds in 24 minutes on Feb. 24 against Minnesota. Victor Claver's second NBA season will likely be paired - fair or not - with the dreaded \"sophomore slump\" label. One of six second-year players on the 2013-14 Trail Blazers, Claver saw the least action (184 minutes total) of his fellow sophomores--the byproduct of an upgraded roster. He appeared in just 21 games this season, spending 45 of the other 61 games on the inactive list. Despite seeing limited playing time, the 25-year-old Claver said being a member of a playoff team provided him with plenty of learning experience to take forward. \"It has been a tough season for me, being inactive most of the games,\" Claver said in his exit interview with the media. \"I'm lucky that that team was doing so well and I was in the routine with everybody, working out every day with the coaches, and that's what I'm going to take from this season .\" The heady Claver, while naturally a small forward, will also take away the experience of playing both at three and stretch-four this year. \"I know that's something good for me, playing both positions,\" Claver said. \"I think as a three I can do a lot of things, not only shoot. As a four it's easier for my body, because I don't have to (chase around faster small forwards).

With a year left on his current contract, Claver remains committed to playing in the NBA - whether in Portland or somewhere more minutes may be available. \"I have one more year on my contract,\" Claver said. \"I want to play one more year (in the NBA).\" I need to play. I don't know where. I don't know if they're gonna give me the opportunity here or I'll have to go to another team but I need to play because it's my last year and it's very important for me. \"Trail Blazers' Hall of Fame coach dies at 89 <mark>Jack Ramsay</mark>, the legendary coach who led the Portland Trail Blazers to the NBA championship in 1977, died Monday in Naples, Florida, after a 15-year battle with cancer.

The agreement has to be approved by the presiding judge in case. (Photo: Twitter/EA Sports) For the last four and a half years Electronic Arts, the NCAA and the Collegiate Licensing Company has been engaged in a lawsuit with Ed O'Bannon, <mark>Sam Keller</mark> and other current and former student athletes. At issue is the NCAA, along with EA and the CLC, using the likeness of the NCAA athletes without any type of reimbursement for the student-athletes themselves. While the NCAA continues to fight the claims of O'Bannon and <mark>Keller</mark>, EA and the CLC announced that the two companies and the student-athletes agreed in principle to a settlement in the lawsuit last year. In documents filed Friday night, the lawyers representing the players asked for the court to finally approve the settlement. With the settlement, over 100,000 current and former NCAA football and men's basketball players are included for possible payment from the $40 million deal made between the players, Electronic Arts and the CLC. This means that for the first time in history, current NCAA athletes could receive payment for using their likeness in a video game. Now while this settlement has been agreed to, this only represents the EA-CLC portion of the lawsuit. The O'Bannon suit against the NCAA is set to begin its trial on June 9 Now while NCAA rules makes it illegal for a current student athlete to profit off of their name and likeness while a student, something that happened to a very famous ex-college football player while he was still in school may have changed that rule and made this settlement possible. \"While in college, former Texas A & M quarterback Johnny Manziel sued a man who sold shirts using the football player's trademarked\" Johnny Football \"nickname. The NCAA said then it would allow Manziel to collect damages if his corporation's lawsuit won,\" wrote CBS Sports' Jon Solomon. \"That's one of the most interesting things is what's the NCAA going to say about eligible players?\" said Leonard Aragon, an attorney for the <mark>Sam Keller</mark> plaintiffs in the video game settlement. \"It's our opinion that it's the same thing here as Manziel. If someone stole your laptop, you'd be able to get payment and still be considered an amateur. Here, right of publicity is a property right .\" Back in September, EA cancelled their NCAA Football franchise while the lawsuit was still pending. This was after the SEC conference pulling out of the game also. \"Today I am sad to announce that we will not be publishing a new college football game next year, and we are evaluating our plan for the future of the franchise,\" said Cam Weber, GM of American Football from EA Sports on the company's site. \"This is as profoundly disappointing to the people who make this game as I expect it will be for millions who enjoy playing it ach year .\" \"We have been struck in the middle of a dispute between the NCAA and student-athletes who seek compensation for playing college football. Just like companies that broadcasts college games and those that provide equipment and apparel, we follow rules that are set by the NCAA - but those rules are being challenged by some student-athletes. The ongoing legal issues combined with increased questions surround schools and conference have left us in a difficult position - one that challenges our ability to deliver an authentic sports experience, which is the very foundation of EA Sports games .\" Rod Carey, another of <mark>Sam Keller</mark>'s lawyers, estimates that 7,000 players, or 20% of current college athletes in Division 1-A, are eligible for a payment from settlement. The payouts could range from $96 and $517 per roster year appearance, depending on the amount of claims made by players. A player who claims who appeared in four consecutive editions of EA Sports' NCAA Football games could receive thousands of dollars due the settlement. As of press time, the NCAA themselves are reviewing the terms of the agreement, which is the first time that a NCAA partner will reimburse student athletes for using their likeness. Here is what the named plaintiffs in the EA-CLC case will receive. - $15,000 to former Arizona State/Nebraska football player <mark>Sam Keller</mark> - $15,000 to former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon - $15,000 to former Rutgers football player Ryan Hart - $5,000 to former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston - $5,000 to the remaining plaintiffs who were deposed - $2,500 for all other named plaintiffs In March, Judge Claudia Wilken ordered the NCAA and O'Bannon's lawyers to set June 9 th as the date that the case would go to trial. With EA and the CLC out of the lawsuit, pending Judge Wilken's approval, it seems that the NCAA are on an island by themselves in a case that could change the way things are done in college athletics...and it's about time.

Novel NextGen Sequencing Test Developed for Retinoblastoma Test identifies germline mutations of gene responsible for childhood eye cancer 6/2/2014 5:10 PM EDT Source Newsroom: Contact Information Available for logged-in reporters only Newswise - Researchers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) have developed a unique next-generation sequencing test for the gene linked to retinoblastoma. The new approach is both more comprehensive and can be conducted in less time than existing tests - enabling early detection of the cancer's genetic cause, which is critical for optimal treatment outcomes. The test was developed to serve the needs of the Retinoblastoma program at CHLA's Vision Center, one of the largest clinical programs in the U.S., caring for approximately 20% of the nation's retinoblastoma cases and seeing as many as 50 new patients each year. Retinoblastoma - a malignant cancer of early childhood that arises from immature retinal cells in one or both eyes - can start growing at any time before birth up until about seven years of age. Among infants and children, common signs of this cancer include having a white \"glow\" or \"glint\" in the pupil of one or both eyes, the presence of a white pupil in a color photo, or crossed or misaligned eyes. Early detection is vital because, when left untreated, retinoblastoma can result in blindness or death. In germline cases, the disease causing mutation is present in cells throughout the body resulting in tumors in both eyes, as well as in other locations throughout the body. Therefore, early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for determining the best course of treatment. A team of physicians and scientists from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine's Center for Personalized Medicine, working with clinicians and surgeons from the Vision Center, developed the CHLA retinoblastoma next generation (RB1 NextGen) sequencing panel based on deep DNA sequencing technology, using novel technical and bioinformatics methodology to sequence the entire RB1 gene. Conventional genetic testing for retinoblastoma typically involves sequencing of specific hot spots within the gene where there are known to be numerous mutations. When CHLA researchers set out to develop their own laboratory-derived test, they took a very different approach in order to sequence the entire gene from end to end. \"Typically, we have used NextGen sequencing capability to sequence many genes at a relatively low depth of coverage\" explained Alexander Judkins, MD, FRCP, head of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. \"Our team took a very different approach by deciding to look at a high depth of coverage of a single gene, sequencing through the entire gene, which is technically very difficult to do .\" With the existing NextGen sequencing approach for retinoblastoma, there are regions of genes that do not get examined at all, potentially allowing significant data to be missed, added Timothy Triche, MD, PhD, Director of the Center for Personalized Medicine at CHLA. \"New data tells us that the non-coding DNA is extremely important. And one of the strengths of our approach is in examining those non-coding areas .\" By sequencing the whole gene, researchers are able to see more frequent occurrences of germline mutations of the RB gene. Because germline mutations can be passed on, this knowledge can better inform the correct treatment approach for patients when these mutations are identified. \"We used to think that if a child had a tumor in one eye and not in the other eye, it was a result of a somatic mutation. And because somatic carriers don't pass on mutated genes, we believed removal of the tumor stopped the cancer,\" says <mark>Tom Lee</mark>, MD, Director of the Vision Center at CHLA. \"But now we know that there is a percentage - on the order of 10 to 15% of those children who had an apparent somatic mutation - who are actually carrying a germline mutation, putting them at risk of developing subsequent tumors during adolescence or early adulthood .\" <mark>Lee</mark> said that the ability to determine the existence of RB1 germline mutations early has significant implications - not only for the prognosis of a new patient with retinoblastoma, but for siblings who could also be at risk and eventually for a patient's own children, if a germline mutation is detected in a retinoblastoma survivor that could be passed on to future generations. With a legacy of treating hundreds of children with retinoblastoma, CHLA now has the ability to also offer this unique and comprehensive screening test to survivors of the disease or their family members, as well as to patients at other cancer centers. \"We believe that siblings and children of carriers of the germline should be tested immediately after birth because by detecting the gene mutations early can save a patient's vision,\" says <mark>Lee</mark>. Approximately two-thirds of retinoblastoma patients at CHLA have unilateral cases of RB, or cancer in just one eye. While only 15% of cases will test positive for a germline mutation, physicians must treat all patients as though the cancer could potentially be bilaterial, or present in both eyes, a condition commonly associated with having a germline mutation. \"Historically, genetic testing can take up to three or four months-which is a very long time when a child's health is at stake,\" said Jonathan Kim, MD, director of the Retinoblastoma Program at CHLA. \"Doing our tests faster and on site has the potential to significantly improve treatments outcomes for all of our patients .\" \"This test enables our researchers to look at the RB1 gene more comprehensively,\" says Judkins. The collection of new genomic data on RB1 will hopefully enable basic researchers to translate this material into biologically meaningful insights, leading to earlier detection and new treatments for both primary and recurrent disease. \"Heath care providers interested in the new RB1 NextGen Sequencing test may contact the Laboratory Service Center of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Children's Hospital Los Angeles by calling KIDZ LAB (877-543-9522) or 323 361 2423.

But when she steps into her new state coach for the first time on Wednesday, for the procession to the state opening of Parliament, she could be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at its arrival, eight years too late. The coach, now named after the Diamond Jubilee only two years ago, is an extraordinary gift from a 64-year-old Australian craftsman who once spent three years looking after the Queen's horses. Jim Frecklington, an ardent royalist who grew up on an outback sheep farm, has spent the last nine years building the coach, mortgaging his house to finance the $5M (\u00a3 2.7 m) project. Gold inlaid carriage which may carry Prince William to wedding completed for the Queen At 18ft (5m) long and 11ft (3m) high, it is only the second coach to be built for the royal family in the last century. And Mr Frecklington has not wasted the opportunity, creating a \"time capsule of British history\" on wheels. More than 100 fragments from historic British buildings have been incorporated into the bodywork, including wood from the Mary Rose, Henry VIII's flagship, and a piece of a doorway from 10 Downing Street that dates back to 1760. The armrests were crafted from the Royal Yacht Britannia's handrails and the crown that sits atop the roof was carved using oak from HMS Victory, Admiral Nelson's ship. There is apple wood from Woolsthorpe Manor, the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton, and timber from Sir Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic base. Mr Frecklington built his first cart at the age of eight when a stubborn Shetland pony refused to be ridden on the family farm. Building carriages quickly grew to become an obsession. Interior view of the Diamond Jubilee State Coach (\u00a9 HM QUEEN ELIZABETH II) In 1972, he moved to Britain and joined the Royal Household, initially looking after the Duke of Edinburgh's horses at Windsor Castle. Later, he tended to the Queen's show horses at Buckingham Palace, driving carriages on ceremonial occasions and serving as an outrider at Royal Ascot. Three years later, he moved back to Australia, but maintained his royal connections. He took two royal coaches across the country during the Queen's Silver Jubilee exhibition in 1977. \"People would often ask\" does anyone make coaches any more?' \"he said .\" The art of making coaches was lost as the men who made them had all gone into making bodies for motor vehicles. \"Mr Frecklington was determined to change that. So, in 1988, the Queen gave him his blessing to make his first royal carriage, the Australian State Coach. It was given by Australia to mark the country's bicentenary and has been used by the Queen for previous state openings of Parliament. As a token of her gratitude, Mr Frecklington was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. That first coach took just 11 months to finish, but this one has taken rather longer. Because it is his own\" private initiative \"rather than a palace commission, Mr Frecklington has found it difficult to finance the coach's construction. The Australian government gave him a $250,000 (\u00a3 138,000) grant, but turned down a subsequent request for a further $5m. Mr Frecklington was undeterred, and instead mortgaged his house and persuaded some of the 50 craftsmen to work on the project as a favour. Brass plaques commemorate famous people, events, and feats of engineering accross the ages (\u00a9 HM QUEEN ELIZABETH II) David Flint, a friend and fellow Australian monarchist, said Mr Frecklington had taken a\" substantial risk \", but was\" driven \"to complete the coach by his\" tremendous respect for the monarchy \".\" This has been a monumental project that he has undertaken, \"said Prof Flint .\" He took a risk, which involved a considerable amount of money. I think it was several million [Australian dollars]. I understand he did mortgage his place for it. \"He has a very fine sense of what is beautiful and appropriate, and a spectacular way of bringing together craftsmen. He has a tremendous respect for the monarchy .\" He likes the sense that there is something tangible which represents history and tradition and is also something that is practical and beautiful. \"The coach has now been purchased by the Royal Collection Trust, which will put it on public display in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace from Sunday. A spokesman refused to disclose how much they paid for it, and whether Mr Frecklington remains out of pocket. But Mr Frecklington has said he regards his endeavours as\" money well spent \"and\" good value \". He has travelled to London and will watch his coach take to a public road for the first time on Wednesday. For the past nine years, it has sat in his workshop, a former army barracks in a Sydney suburb. From his workshop, he arranged for the four lamps, with crystal panels, to be hand-blown and cut in Edinburgh and for 260 sapphires and 48 diamonds to be fitted into the door handles. The door panels are inlaid with timber from dozens of historically significant buildings, including St Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, Eton, and Oxford and Cambridge universities. There is also timber from Althorp, the final resting place of Diana, the Princess of Wales, the old royal box at Ascot, and from the Ferriby Boat, which dates back 3,800 years. The bodywork features a calibration penny used to fine-tune <mark>Big Ben</mark>, a lead musket ball from the Battle of Waterloo and a piece of metal from the casting of the Victoria Cross. A\" tribute case \"contains a fragment from the stone of destiny, used in the coronation ceremony, which was stolen from Westminster Abbey by Scottish nationalists in 1950 and is now kept in Edinburgh Castle. Mr Frecklington sent out hundreds of letters requesting the samples, and he was supported by English Heritage and the royal household's surveyors of the fabric. Aside from a discreet engraving on the wheel, there is no nod to the coach's designer. He is happy instead to celebrate\" one of the greatest monarchs that has ever lived \".

There have been rumors for a couple weeks that Benji and Cameron were dating when they were seen together at a gym in LA, but Benji refused to confirm the rumors when he was asked during an interview on an Australian radio show. But now Star Magazine is able to confirm that even if the two aren't officially dating, they're at least making out, because they up and got some pictures of it. And in addition, another source says they saw Benji and Cameron having breakfast with a group of six people at ABC Kitchen in Manhattan:\" Throughout the entire meal, Cameron and Benji couldn't keep their hands off each other. They were whispering to each other and laughing, just having the best time together. \"Well this sounds pretty cute, actually. And for anyone who's wondering how they met, it was apparently through Cameron's friend Nicole Richie, who as you may recall is married to Benji's brother and Good Charlotte bandmate, Joel Madden .\" Everyone else at the table was talking and catching up, but Benji and Cameron were completely removed from the conversation. They were totally consumed with each other. Benji kept his arm around her, and she'd just rest her head on his shoulder and stare at him, grinning. It was obvious that she's crazy about him. \", and <mark>Alex Rodriguez</mark>, so Benji isn't someone I'd expect to be her type.
