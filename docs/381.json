Klein started at MLB | Mike Triplett Some other lineup/attendance notables during Saints OTA practice Thursday: A.J. Klein started at MLB (though Manti Te'o still rehabbing). Newly-signed vet Josh LeRibeus at center in place of injured Max Unger. Senio Kelemete and Bryce Harris split time at LT while Terron Armstead watched from the side. P.J. <mark>Williams</mark> started at CB opposite Delvin Breaux. Rookie S <mark>Marcus Williams</mark> spent time with first string in three-safety alignment. DE Hau'oli Kikaha did some individual work as he rehabs from ACL. WR Willie Snead was present but did not participate. DT Nick Fairley did not appear to be in attendance.

Veteran Josh LeRibeus getting a look at center for Saints this summer with Max Unger out | theadvocate.com \"It was really just the ballhandling, just learning how to snap,\" LeRibeus said. \"Because at guard, you just block the guy, so now you have a little extra aspect, but my whole thing is repetition .\" LeRibeus spent the entire 2016 season as a free agent, but with Unger's injury--the Saints' starter is expected back near the end of the preseason--there's an opening this summer to potentially fight for a roster spot. Veteran Tim Lelito, who backed up Unger last year, left for Tennessee in free agency, and Kelemete is the offensive line's sixth man. Marshon Lattimore is trying to circumvent what can be a hard learning curve for rookie cornerbacks | theadvocate.com So, it shouldn't be a surprise that first-round pick Marshon Lattimore didn't have a perfect showing during his debut practice before the media. He was never targeted during Thursday's organized team activity and appeared to be in phase on each route he defended, but there were other moments when he looked like a rookie trying to figure things out. One of those moments came late in the session when he failed to pick up his receiver coming out of the huddle, and the play had to be restarted. Lattimore was affixed to the right side of the field, and by the time he saw his guy lining up to the left and made his way over it was too late. \"My confidence level is at an all-time high,\" Breaux said Thursday after Saints organized team activities. \"I've worked my behind off this offseason just to know that it's time to be that Pro Bowl or All-Pro type guy .\" I just been working, man, and feel great. \"Can Okafor Give the Saints Pass Rush an Edge? \u2022 Saints News Network Okafor can play standing up or with his\" hand in the dirt \", and it's probably likely that the Saints will make him the new\" official' starter at that spot right out the gate; although he'll more than likely fill a situational role as part of a 3-man rotation and no doubt will have to show everyone that he can avoid the nagging injuries that constantly plagued him with the Cardinals. For Saints fans however, the addition of Okafor is looked at in a bit more simpler terms, which is: Can Okafor be the \"complementary\" player on the opposite side of All-Pro defensive end Cam Jordan that the team has lacked since the departure of former defensive end Junior Galette; and give their pass rush \"an edge\" that it has been sorely lacking for the past few seasons? <mark>Adrian Peterson</mark> working on pass-catching skills, and other Saints OTA observations | NOLA.com The Saints played primarily nickel defense throughout the practice. It looked like the familiar 4-2-5 defense we watched most of last season. Alex Okafor, predictably, manned the defensive end spot opposite Cam Jordan. Sheldon Rankins and David Onyemata took snaps with the first unit with Nick Fairley and Tyeler Davison not practicing.

World | | Updated: May 27, 2017 15:58 IST Reuters 6 Shares PRINT COMMENTS The suspect was arrested when he got off the train where he committed the murders (Representational) Two men were stabbed to death in the US city of Portland on Friday when they tried to stop their attacker from harassing two women because they appeared to be Muslim, police said. The incident unfolded on a commuter train hours before the start of Ramadan, Islam's holy month, when most of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims observe a religious fast. The attack began shortly before 4:30 pm when a man started yelling ethnic and religious slurs toward two women who appeared to be Muslim on a MAX train at the Hollywood Transit Station, the Portland Police Department said in a statement. Three men who intervened were stabbed, two fatally. The attacker was arrested shortly after he got off the train, police said, adding that the women left the scene before police could interview them. \"In the midst of his ranting and raving, some people approached him and appeared to try to intervene with his behavior and some of the people that he was yelling at,\" Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said during a news conference aired by local news outlets. \"They were attacked viciously by the suspect,\" he added. In a statement responding to Friday's attack, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said that anti-Muslim incidents increased by more than 50 percent in the United States from 2015 to 2016 due in part to President <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s focus on terrorist groups and anti-immigrant rhetoric. \"President <mark>Trump</mark> must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities,\" said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. The <mark>Donald Trump</mark> administration says that while it strongly opposes what it calls \"radical Islamic terrorists\" , it has no quarrel with Islam. Following the attack, police said one of the men died at the scene while another died at a hospital. The third man was treated for non-life threatening injuries. \"These were folks just riding the train and unfortunately got caught up in this,\" he said. Witnesses told police that the two young women were possibly Muslim. One wore a hijab. Portland police did not identify the suspect or the victims.
