2012 mustang boss 302 set to become the quickest, best-handling straight-production mustang ever offered by ford? boss upgraded in nearly every vehicle system; engine output, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior all examined to optimize weight, aerodynamics and track performance? full mustang team effort results in a comprehensive re-engineering available only through the factory; new boss is not a package that can be purchased out of a catalog or achieved through tuning or aftermarket parts? limited-production track-oriented boss 302 laguna seca model expands on boss racing aspirations, deleting rear seat and adding race-ready suspension and aerodynamic treatments ford buyers guide monterey, ca - august 13, 2010: ford gave the green light only once before: in 1968, management approved a special mustang - a car that sacrificed nothing in its quest to be the best all-around road-going performance machine ever created by ford motor company. that car became the 1969 mustang boss 302, and it remains one of the world's most sought-after examples of american performance. forty-two years later, ford has given the green light again. the team of ford engineers, designers and stylists - all mustang enthusiasts to the core - that created the groundbreaking 2011 mustang gt has distilled a new model to its purest form, strengthening, lightening and refining each system to create a race car with a license plate. its name: the 2012 mustang boss 302. \"the decision to build a modern boss was not entered into lightly,\" said derrick kuzak, group vice president, global product development. \"the entire team at ford felt the time was right and with the right ingredients, the world-class 2011 mustang could support a successful, race-bred, worthy successor to the original boss 302. for us that meant a production mustang that could top one of the world's best - the 2010 bmw m3 - in lap times at laguna seca. we met our expectations.\" to celebrate the racing heritage of the new mustang boss 302, ford will also offer a limited number of boss 302 laguna seca models, named for the track where parnelli jones won the 1970 trans-am season opener in a boss 302. aimed at racers more interested in on-track performance than creature comforts, the boss 302 laguna seca has increased body stiffness, a firmer chassis set-up and an aerodynamics package carried over almost in its entirety from the ford racing boss 302r. click play to watch the 2012 mustang boss 302 promo video philosophy and powertrain \"the new boss 302 completely redefines mustang capability,\" said <mark>mark fields</mark>, ford president of the americas. \"that the mustang team was able to take the current mustang gt - already a world-class performance car - and refine it further for peak track performance shows the commitment ford has to this car and its legions of fans.\" driving the 2012 mustang boss 302 was intended from the outset to be a visceral experience, packed with raw, unbridled performance across the spectrum: acceleration, handling, braking, and top speed are all equally matched for perfect balance on a car operating within the framework of legally defined safety, noise and emissions regulations. \"the team at ford wanted to offer their fellow mustang enthusiasts something really special - a beautifully balanced factory-built race car that they could drive on the street,\" explains dave pericak, mustang chief engineer. \"the boss 302 isn't something a mustang gt owner can buy all the parts for out of a catalog or that a tuner can get by adding a chip. this is a front-to-back re-engineered mustang with every system designed to make a good driver great and a great driver even better.\" led by <mark>mike harrison</mark>, the v8 engine team approached boss from the top down: with 412 horsepower from 5.0 liters, the 2011 gt engine was already an incredible performer. but to achieve the high-rpm horsepower that would make the engine competitive on the track, a new intake was essential. the resulting runners-in-the-box plenum/velocity stack combination the engine team developed was impressive enough that it got the green light after one short drive. helping the intake build power, revised camshafts using a more aggressive grind are actuated with the same twin independent variable camshaft timing (ti-vct) mechanism used on the mustang gt. more aggressive control calibration yields 440 horsepower and 380 lb.-ft. of torque, while still offering a smooth idle and low-end torque for comfortable around-town driving. a race-inspired clutch with upgraded friction materials transmits power, while a short-throw, close-ratio six-speed manual transmission handles gear change duties. power is delivered to a 3.73 ratio rear axle using carbon fiber plates in the limited-slip differential to improve torque handling and longevity. for those who want even more precise control over power delivery, a torque-sensing (torsen) limited-slip differential is an available option coupled with recaro front seats. sounds like the boss while the powertrain team defined output targets that would yield an ideal balance with the chassis, another team made sure the car made the kind of sounds owners and enthusiasts would expect from a mustang boss. up front, a boss-specific intake system is tuned to feed the engine with minimum restrictions. a retuned induction sound tube provides concrete aural evidence of what's occurring under the hood. and, in the boss exhaust system engineers really had some fun. \"with an exhaust system, we have to consider three constraints: legal noise restrictions; backpressure, which can rob power; and ground clearance,\" explains shawn carney, mustang nvh engineer. \"since the 2011 mustang gt exhaust is already so free-flowing - it came in way under our backpressure targets - we already had excellent performance; we were able to tune the exhaust system for a unique sound. combined with the rush of the intake, the exhaust system really envelops the driver in v8 sound.\" click play to watch and hear the new mustang on the road every boss features a unique quad exhaust system: two outlets exit in the rear similar to a standard mustang gt. the other two outlets exit to either side of the exhaust crossover, sending exhaust through a set of metal discs that act as tuning elements before the pipes terminate just ahead of the rear wheel opening. visually subtle, the side pipes flow very little exhaust but a lot of exhaust sound, providing a sonic experience unlike any other mustang - and giving home tuners an additional avenue for modification. \"we added the attenuation discs to meet legal regulations, but we knew buyers might operate these cars in situations where noise regulations weren't an issue,\" carney said. \"the disc is removable and includes a spacer plate sized to match aftermarket exhaust dump valves. if an owner wants to add a set of electric valves, they just undo two bolts on either side; the disc and spacer slide out and the valve will slide right in. and the side pipes are tuned so that drivers can run wide-open and the sound levels are comfortable - very aggressive but livable for an all-day track outing.\" carney further explains the thinking behind the unusual step of an oem easing aftermarket component installation. \"we're ford engineers, but we're also enthusiasts,\" he says. \"we understand owner mods are part of the mustang experience, so we try to help where we can.\" suspension and steering in keeping with the boss mandate to provide the best-handling mustang ever, the already strong mustang gt suspension system has been further refined. higher-rate coil springs on all four corners, stiffer suspension bushings and a larger-diameter rear stabilizer bar all contribute to the road racing mission, and boss models are lowered by 11 millimeters at the front and 1 millimeter at the rear versus the mustang gt. the real key to handling, though, is in the adjustable shocks and struts, standard on all boss mustang models. \"we've given drivers five settings for their shocks,\" says brent clark, supervisor of the mustang vehicle dynamics team. \"one is the softest, two is the factory setting and five is the firmest, and we've provided a wide range of adjustment. a customer can drive to the track on setting two, crank it up to five for improved response on the track, then dial down to one for a more relaxed ride home. what's unique is that drivers will find - thanks to the way the suspension works as a complete system - the softest setting isn't too loose and the firmest setting isn't too controlled; each step just provides additional levels of control.\" also unique is the method of shock adjustment. ditching the weight and complexity of electronic wizardry, the mustang team opted for traditional race-style hands-on adjustability - similar to the gabriel shocks available on the original boss 302. \"the shock adjustment is right at the top of the shock tower, built into the rod and easily accessible from under the hood or inside the trunk,\" says clark. \"you just take a small flat-head screwdriver, turn the adjustment screw between one and five, and head back out onto the track.\" to complement the suspension, the speed-sensitive electronic steering system has been retuned to maximize feedback and road feel to the driver. the driver is also given the option of fine-tuning the steering feel to his liking by selecting one of three settings through the instrument cluster menu: comfort, normal and sport modes help offer track-tuned steering when desired without sacrificing low-speed maneuverability in parking situations and everyday commuting. similarly, boss receives unique traction control system (tcs) and electronic stability control (esc) settings to help drivers achieve maximum performance whether on the street or at the track. both systems can be completely disabled in controlled track situations where maximum driver skill is utilized, or fully engaged for maximum safety during normal driving or in less-than-ideal traction conditions. intermediate sport mode allows drivers to push their cars hard at the track without completely disabling the safety systems, permitting more aggressive driving before the tcs and esc systems intervene. brakes, wheels and tires working in concert with the suspension upgrades, boss 302 receives unique, lightweight 19-inch black alloy racing wheels in staggered widths: 9 inches in front, 9.5 inches in the rear. the pirelli pzero summer tires are sized specifically for each end of the vehicle, with the front wheels receiving 255/40zr -19 tires while the rear stays planted thanks to 285/35zr -19 rubber. the combined suspension and tire package allows boss to achieve a top speed of 155 mph and become the first non-svt mustang ever to achieve more than 1.0 g of lateral acceleration. boss braking is also up to the challenge, using brembo four-piston front calipers acting on 14-inch vented rotors up front. in the back, standard mustang gt brakes are upgraded with a boss-specific high-performance pad compound. combined with vented brake shields and unique anti-lock brake system (abs) tuning, boss drivers get maximum control and rapid, repeatable fade-free stops in road and race situations alike. the mustang team spent considerable time ensuring the brake pedal feel met the expectations of performance drivers. boss receives unique low-compressibility brake lines that expand up to 30 percent less than traditional flexible brake lines, allowing maximum fluid pressure to reach the calipers in the least amount of time, giving the driver a sensation of being connected directly to the brake pads. \"this car is wicked fast, so we put a lot of emphasis on giving it comparable stopping power,\" says clark. \"we started with a race-proven brake system and tuned it specifically for the characteristics of the boss 302 and its mission. they're the best brakes ever installed on a mustang, and they give consistent, repeatable braking performance on the street and the track.\" as a result 60-0 stopping distances for the boss are improved by approximately three feet versus the mustang gt with available brake package; combined with suspension and engine improvements, boss is expected to show approximately a two-second lap time improvement over the gt on a typical road race course. but the numbers tell only part of the story. \"we achieved measurable improvements over gt, which was already one of the best-braking cars we've ever designed,\" explains clark, \"but what's harder to quantify is how good these brakes feel to a driver in a race situation. like everything on this car, the brakes are more than the sum of their parts: they're tuned from pad to pedal to work perfectly as a system, and the difference is dramatic.\" exterior and interior design changes to the mustang boss exterior are subtle but unmistakable. true to its race-bred heritage, every component that could potentially aid aerodynamics or engine/brake performance was examined to make the vehicle more competitive, while chief designer darrell behmer refined the styling to evoke the 1969 boss in a contemporary way. \"we approached this as curators of a legend,\" explains behmer. \"we've taken design cues from the '69 boss street car and the menacing bud moore/parnelli jones race cars and carefully updated them to give the 2012 the proper bad-boy attitude that is unmistakably a boss mustang.\" to set boss apart, each car will have either a black or white roof panel, coordinated to the color of the side c-stripe. available exterior colors are competition orange, performance white, kona blue metallic, yellow blaze tri-coat metallic and race red. up front, a unique fascia and grille are highlighted by the blocked-off fog lamp openings and aggressive lower splitter, a version of the design used - and proven - on the boss 302r race car. the front splitter is designed to function at high speeds by efficiently managing the air under and around the car. it helps to reduce underbody drag and front end lift while more effectively forcing air through the boss-specific cooling system. at the rear of the car, the spoiler was chosen to complement the front aero treatment and minimize overall drag. \"what we were after on boss was reduced overall lift with improved balance,\" says pericak. \"we needed to keep the car glued to the street or the track at high speeds without increasing drag or affecting top speed and fuel usage. the end result is an aero package that uses front, rear and underbody treatments not for show, but for effect - the balance and stability of this car all the way to its 155-mph top speed is just outstanding.\" inside, a unique boss steering wheel covered completely in alcantara suede complements the standard seats, which are trimmed in cloth with a suede-like center insert to firmly hold occupants in place. boss customers who want the ultimate seating experience can select a package that includes recaro buckets, designed by ford svt in cooperation with recaro for high performance mustang models, and shared between the boss and gt500. a dark metallic instrument panel finish, gauge cluster and door panel trim also differentiate boss from the standard mustang, while a black pool-cue shifter ball and \"powered by ford\" door sill plates further remind customers they're in a special car. the boss interior gets an aural kick thanks to what's been removed. eleven pounds of sound-deadening material have been eliminated to let occupants further enjoy the intake, engine and exhaust note. auto genie = helps you create \"first cut\" new car

loan providers such as money mart. from barack obama to congress to state legislatures, there seems to be a groundswell of support to regulate the payday loans industry in the united states and lower fees charged to customers. there are 15 states that already effectively prohibit payday loans through caps on interest rates for small loans. others are considering similar legislation. not so in canada. nearly two years after the federal government turned over regulation of the industry to the provinces, some of the highest fees in north america have been approved, all in the name of consumer protection. the new payday loan landscape has been greeted warmly by u.s. companies, which are looking at trying to expand their share of the $2-billion annual market in canada. it has left consumer advocates disappointed and asking why loans under $1,500 have been exempted from the maximum interest rates allowed under the criminal code. \"canada is going in the opposite direction,\" said john lawford, counsel for the public interest advocacy centre in ottawa. \"it is disappointing that the federal government washed its hands.\" since the legislative change in 2007, several provinces have announced regulations that will require the industry to be licensed and more transparent about its fees and which attempt to restrict some lending practices. the most contentious area remains the maximum fees that will be permitted. four provinces so far have decided on fee caps that will take effect later this year. ontario and british columbia are permitting total fees of well over $60 for a typical $300 loan to be repaid in 14 days, at a time when interest rates are at historic lows. the fees are nearly 15 times what a credit card company would charge for a cash advance over the same time period. an independent regulator in nova scotia approved maximum fees of $93 per two-week $300 loan, an annual percentage rate (apr) of interest of more than 800%. it is the second-highest rate in north america, with b.c. and ontario close behind, of the jurisdictions that regulate the fees that can be charged (six u.s. states do not have caps on fees). the average cost in regulated states is about $45 for a $300 loan. as well, there are ways \"to do an end-run\" on some of the restricted practices, such as rollover loans, said mr. lawford. some companies offer a \"back-to-back\" loan, depositing money into a customer's account and charging new fees, as soon as the previous pay cheque clears. it is only in quebec where the maximum annual interest rate for any loan is 35%, that there is no payday loan industry. in the rest of the country, the new rates might be considered a form of stimulus for payday lenders. the pennsylvania-based parent company of money mart noted \"there are significant opportunities to grow our business in canada,\" in its latest quarterly financial report, which talked of \"pruning\" operations in the united states. advance america, the leading payday lender in the united states, is turning its attention north of the border. \"we look at canada as an opportunity. canada is a good place to be. we just want to let the legislative process play itself out,\" said spokesman jamie fulmer. when british columbia and ontario announced its new rates this spring, both provinces presented the news as consumer focused. \"ontario protects payday loan users\" said a release issued by the government of dalton mcguinty. not stated was the fact that the new rates are higher than money mart, by far the largest payday lender in the province, was already charging. the allowable fees are also greater than previous money mart charges that are at the centre of a class-action suit against the company, now at the trial stage in ontario superior court, nearly six years after the legal action was initiated. harvey strosberg, lead counsel in the money mart lawsuit, suggested ontario moved too quickly. \"we believe the government made a fundamental policy error in deciding the issue before this trial is over and all the evidence is in about the ways these companies really work,\" said mr. strosberg. last week, cash store financial announced a $14-million settlement in a class action over past fees in b.c. that were about the same rate it will be permitted to charge there in the future (new class actions are unlikely now that the industry is exempted from the criminal code interest rate laws). the ontario government \"is trying to strike a balance\" to protect consumers and \"to ensure the industry continues to exist,\" said sarbjit kaur, a spokeswoman for harinder takhar, minister of small business and consumer services. while she stressed the rate caps set out only the top fee permitted, consumer advocates point to the u.s. experience, where maximum rates are what most companies charge. this view was echoed in a 2007 policy paper published by the consumer protection services division of the ontario government. \"it is fair to say that the maximum rate has become the only rate,\" in the united states, noted the policy paper. the profits made by the industry have been exaggerated, countered stan keyes, president of the canadian payday loan association. as well, a provincially regulated industry is the best way, he said, to provide a service to people who need small, short-terms loans. \"do we want people going to pawn shops, bouncing cheques or going to the pool hall to borrow from some unscrupulous person,\" asked mr. keyes. the stark choice between a regulated industry with high fees and the pool hall loan shark is a false comparison, said byron williams, of the manitoba public interest law centre. \"the scare stories have not been proven,\" he stated. an independent board in manitoba imposed fees of $17 per $100, the lowest in the country, after a full regulatory hearing. the provincial government has since taken control of the rate setting process and introduced legislation this spring that should result in $17 as the maximum charge, with a sliding fee scale downward for loans over $500. \"the process has been transparent,\" said mr. williams, \"with the benefit of a fully participating consumer.\" five provinces have yet to set maximum fees. but there has been little talk of u.s. style regulation in any of them. exclusive: a father's fight: may 14 weeks after a father's little girl

David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the government agency that manages the coral expanse off northeast Australia, said ocean temperatures over the next month will be crucial to how the reef recovers from heat-induced bleaching. \"The forecasts...indicate that we can expect ongoing levels of thermal stress for at least the next two weeks and maybe three or four weeks,\" Wachenfeld said in a weekly update on the reef's health on Thursday. \"So this still is a critical time for the reef and it is the weather conditions over the next two to four weeks that will determine the final outcome,\" he said. Ocean temperatures across most of the reef were 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the March average. In parts of the marine park in the south close to shore which avoided the ravages of previous bleachings, ocean temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above average. The authority has received 250 reports of sightings of bleached coral due to elevated ocean temperatures during an unusually hot February. The 345,400-square kilometer (133,360-square mile) World Heritage-listed colorful coral network has been devastated by four coral bleaching events since 1998. The most deadly were the most recent, in consecutive summers in 2016 and 2017. Scientists fear the latest coral death rate could match those events. \"At the moment, it's definitely the most extensive bleaching event we've ever had,\" U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch scientist <mark>William Skirving</mark> said Friday. \"It's certainly an end-to-end bleaching event with severe bits at each end and it's not looking good for the southern end, but it really depends on the weather in the next two weeks,\" he said. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a scientist from the Australian Research Council Center for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies, said how much of the bleached coral would recover and how much would die would not be known for weeks. \"I'm very worried about the situation given how warm the temperatures are on the Great Barrier Reef and what the projections are,\" Hoegh-Guldberg said. \"If it cools down a bit, they'll recover or, if not, we may head off into something not too different from 2016 and 2017. We're right at the fork in the road,\" he added. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority last year downgraded its outlook for the corals' condition from \"poor\" to \"very poor\" due to warming oceans. Its latest report, which is updated every five years, found the greatest threat to the reef remained climate change. The other threats are associated with coastal development, land-based water runoff and human activity such as illegal fishing.

In 1789, eighteen years before slavery was abolished in Great Britain, <mark>William Blake</mark> published the poetry collection Songs of Innocence, among which is the poem \"Little Black Boy.\" <mark>Blake</mark> condemned slavery, which was evidence of the rampant racial inequality of his time (\"<mark>Blake</mark> and Wordsworth\" ). Interestingly, the same year that <mark>Blake</mark> published Songs of Innocence, the French stormed the Bastille, and the ideology of freedom initially upheld by the French revolutionaries was reflected in the goals of abolitionists, both American and British. Other materials were published that year, such as a description of a slave trade ship, a report on the slave trade, a speech about slavery by <mark>William</mark> Wilberforce in the House of Commons, and a former slave by the name of Olaudah Equiano published one of the first books by a black author (Wikipedia). Attitudes about race were changing for the better, leading to increased equality. In the 1960s, as in the US, there was more progress made towards racial equality. The UK passed the Race Relations Act in 1965, which was the first legislation addressing racial discrimination; in 1976 they passed new legislation with the same name, making racial discrimination illegal (EqualityHumanRights.com). <mark>William Blake</mark>'s poem \"The Little Black Boy\" uses racial imagery to convey spiritual truth and oppose the slave trade. The poem is as follows: My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child: But I am black as if bereav'd of light. My mother taught me underneath a tree And sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissed me, And pointing to the east began to say. Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive Comfort in morning joy in the noonday. And we are put on earth a little space, That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove. For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love & care, And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice. Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him and he will then love me. In this poem <mark>Blake</mark> writes from the perspective of a black slave boy in the southern U.S. to promote a biblical view of blacks as equal to whites. In line two, <mark>Blake</mark> states that the boy has a soul, despite the popular belief at the time that black people do not have souls (\"<mark>Blake</mark> and Wordsworth\" ). For slave owners, claiming that black people did not have souls served as a justification of their owning slaves and treating them like animals, who are also believed to lack souls. American and British slave owners who believed the Bible is God's word might have defended slavery by proof-texting a passage such as Ephesians 6:5, which tells slaves to obey their masters. Ephesians 6:5 defends slavery only if the literary and historical context is ignored; slaves in biblical times were often repaying a debt and were freed after their debt had been paid, unless they chose to remain the master's slave. <mark>Blake</mark> insinuates throughout the poem that all people, regardless of skin color, are equal in their relationship to God (lines 3, 9-14, 17-20, 22-28). This is a biblical idea; as Galatians 3:28 (NIV) says, \"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" The black boy compares an English child to an angel because of his white skin, viewing himself as \"bereav'd of light\" (lines 3-4). It had been made clear to blacks that they were inferior to whites; it was ingrained in the culture and in their minds that they were lesser than whites, even when they were striving for equality. The culture, in this case, was wrong; all people are equal, because all are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27). All people are the same in a fundamental aspect, making them all equal. Equality in God's sight is <mark>Blake</mark>'s focus in \"Little Black Boy,\" though equality and fair treatment from whites was also important considering blacks were slaves, both in Britain and America. In lines thirteen and fourteen, the black slave boy relates what his mother taught him: \"And we are put on earth a little space, / That we may learn to bear the [sun] beams of love.\" The sun seems to symbolize the trials men face on earth. This is reminiscent of James 1:2 -4, which says, \"Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything\" (NIV). It seems from the black boy's hope that the English boy will one day love him that <mark>Blake</mark> saw a future day when whites would realize they were not superior to other races and equality would be gained. At the very least, the final lines emphasize that all of God's children are equal in His sight, or, as a popular phrase among Christians puts it, \"the ground is level at the cross.\" <mark>William Blake</mark> masterfully used racial imagery to teach his contemporaries about equality in Christ. It was surely not a popular message for slave owning Brits or Americans at the time, but it is a biblical one. The poem decries the prejudice inherent to racism and the slave trade and points readers to Christ. It was vital to the abolitionist movement that blacks be viewed and treated as equal to whites, and <mark>Blake</mark> communicated this well in \"Little Black Boy.\" Of course, racial equality did not stop there, and freedom for slaves was only the first step. A lot of progress has been made. Today on the internet there is an upsurge of racism, not towards \"people of color,\" generally, but towards whites. While some say things about \"reverse racism isn't real\" or similar things, racism is any prejudice against someone because of their skin color or race. All people should be viewed as equal insofar as they are human regardless of race.

leading the u.s. commission on civil rights inquiry into the new black panther party case (file photo by ryan j. reilly / main justice). the u.s. commission on civil rights has subpoenaed the justice department to obtain documents related to the handling of the case against the new black panther party and several members. documents the commission is seeking include witness statements, copies of investigations by the justice department, reports of suspected voter intimidation, documents on the decision to drop charges and communications among doj officials relating to the case. just one problem - it's up to the justice department to enforce the subpoena from the executive branch agency. and therein lies the conflict. the justice department has declined to hand over the material. it says its employees are not subject to contempt of court for refusing to disclose internal doj documents, under a 1951 u.s. supreme court decision, united states ex rel. touhy v. ragen. in addition, the department is conducting internal reviews related to the incident and has not set a time frame for when it expects to complete them. todd gaziano, the commissioner leading the inquiry into the case, told main justice that doj is stonewalling and that he doesn't buy their explanation for not facilitating the commission's investigation. \"it's a tremendous waste of resources for the attorney general to act in a lawless way,\" gaziano said. \"the department has no statute that exempts them from our subpoena authority.\" the commission's lack of independent authority to enforce the subpoenas it issues doesn't diminish its status, said gaziano. he says the commission had to resort to subpoenas because the department inadequately respond to several letters requesting information. until a final decision related to the commission's review of the matter has been made, the department has instructed the two career civil rights section lawyers subpoenaed so far to \"abide by lawful departmental regulations.\" that means they can't be deposed without the approval of the justice department. \"given the scope of the request, the civil division informed the commission that it would not be able to review its request in the time frame requested,\" said doj spokesperson alejandro miyar. \"we've requested additional information from the commission and we'll respond, but no, there is no time frame.\" rep. lamar smith (photo by ryan j. reilly / main justice). an inquiry into the matter was opened by the office of professional responsibility at the request of house judiciary committee chairman lamar smith (r-texas), according to a doj letter to smith dated aug. 28. members of the black separatist group stood outside a philadelphia polling place last november in

attorney with a record of conservative advocacy, who was hired in 2005 by then-civil rights division political appointee brad schlozman. a joint investigation of schlozman by the doj's inspector general and opr found that schlozman had broken federal law by improperly taking politicla and ideological affiliations into account when hiring career civil service lawyers. the report said schlozman was \"unsuitable for public service\" and found he'd referred to applicants with liberal affiliations as \"mold spores,\" \"commies\" and \"crazy pinkos.\" earlier this year, then-acting civil rights division chief loretta king recommended dismissing most of the complaint, after the new black panther members and the party failed to respond. associate attorney general tom perrelli approved her recommendation, the washington times has reported. most of the complaint was dismissed in may. an injunction was obtained against one new black panther party member who held a nightstick outside the philadelphia polling place. read the notice of dismissal conservatives have characterized the incident as evidence of politicization of the justice department under attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark>. the complaint alleged violations of the voting rights act section 11 (b), which deals with voter intimidation. it was only the third case on alleged violations of section 11 (b) in the history of the voting rights act, passed in 1965. doj officials say they are following department policy regarding disclosure of information about cases and requiring their current and former employees to do the same. \"we've had long standing guidelines that are very clear that current and former employees must be authorized by the department before disclosing internal information regarding their official duties,\" said miyar. \"we have to follow the long standing guidelines.\" in a letter to the justice department, the commission's general counsel refered to a \"dearth of cooperation\" on the part of the department. \"we are mindful of the sensitivity of the subject matter involved and aware that, in response to similar requests, the department has raised various concerns and matters of privilege,\" wrote david blackwood. \"while such considerations carry weight, cooperation with commission investigations is a mandatory statutory obligation.\" democratic commissioners have criticized the agency's narrow focus on the black panther incident. but at least one prominent republican also agrees. \"they're provoking a confrontation with the white house, and i'm not sure what the benefits are going to be,\" conservative commentator linda chavez, a former staff director for the commission, told main justice. \"obama has left them alone for now, but he could come in and make big changes,\" said chavez. calling the commission an \"odd hybrid,\" that has been \"a thorn in the side of many different administrations,\" chavez said she considers the commission an executive branch agency with very little authority. she said the information it is requesting from the justice department, specifically the internal communications between officials handling the case, should fall under executive privilege. \"it calls up the whole question of whether the commission has outlived it's usefulness,\" said chavez. gaziano disagreed with chavez. the commission's subpoena power is akin to that of a congressional committee, said gaziano."}, {"articleID": "2014040509_00029856_W", "names": {"Jack O'Connell": ["Q16028203", "Q16184113", "Q16733588",

ACTOR Callan Mulvey relishes every day he's on a film set, even when he's getting his \"arse kicked\" . The Auckland-born actor, who moved to Australia at the age of eight and is best known locally for his starring roles in Heartbreak High, Rush and Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms, has found success in Hollywood since moving to the US last year. The 39-year-old made his international feature film debut as a member of the US Navy's famed SEAL Team 6 in Zero Dark Thirty alongside Aussies Nash and Joel Edgerton. Now the film roles are, well, rolling in. Just last month he was shirtless, and bulked up, in the release of Greek action drama 300: Rise of an Empire. And now he's getting his butt served to him by none other than Captain America himself in the latest Marvel film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Callan Mulvey, left, and <mark>Jack O'Connell</mark> in 300: Rise of an Empire. \"I've been working pretty solidly, which is great,\" Mulvey told APN from his home in LA. \"It certainly helps having 300 and Captain America coming out and having a presence in this market. It has really sped things along.\" Mulvey has the rare honour of signing on for a sequel which fans and critics have hailed as being better than its predecessor. Directors Anthony and <mark>Joe Russo</mark> have clearly hit on a winning formula and have already signed on to direct a third Captain America film. \"Apart from Joss Whedon, they were the only directors Marvel invited to come back,\" Mulvey said. Mulvey's character Jack Rollins is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who goes into the field with Captain America, but ultimately answers to Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). He features prominently in a scene where some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents turn on Captain America in a fight sequence in a lift. \"I certainly had a few fight scenes where I got my arse kicked by other people, which was fun,\" he said. Mulvey's bruised and beaten character can be seen top right. \"I had probably two or three lines (in the film), one of which made the trailer. I was very happy about that.\" It's just cool being on any set, let alone a Marvel set. You're just standing around with Robert Redford. \"While he's yet to share any scenes with another Marvel superhero, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the two actors do catch up when they can in Los Angeles. Mulvey has worked with Hemsworth's older brother Luke twice, including the upcoming Aussie indie film Kill Me Three Times. But Mulvey's career will really take off if he lands the role of Lex Luthor in next year's Batman vs Superman movie, which already stars Ben Affleck, <mark>Amy Adams</mark> and Henry Cavill.

By Chao Xiong Star Tribune February 6, 2018--1:44 pm Purchase: Order Reprint The legal question of whether Minnesota Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach can remain a state senator may not be resolved before the start of the upcoming legislative session. Ramsey County District Court Judge John Guthmann heard arguments Tuesday morning from attorney Charles Nauen, who argued that the state Constitution demands that Fischbach resign her legislative seat now that she has ascended to lieutenant governor. The outcome of the lawsuit has the potential to realign power between the majority GOP and minority DFL in the closely divided Senate. Fischbach's attorney, Kevin Magnuson, argued that the suit should be dismissed because the court has no jurisdiction over the dual offices, which he said is allowed under the state Constitution. Guthmann took the matter under advisement after an hourlong hearing Tuesday. Reached afterward, Guthmann declined to say when he would rule, or, whether the time frame would be influenced by the legislature's Feb. 20 start date. He has 90 days to issue a decision. Nauen is representing Sauk Rapids resident Destiny Dusosky, a Democrat who filed the suit in January against Fischbach, a Republican who represents Senate District 13. \"To me, it's a matter of the constitution,\" Dusosky said after the hearing. \"Our constitution clearly plays out that we have three separate branches of government, and we need to keep those branches separate and keep those powers separate...\"Fischbach also addressed media after the hearing, saying that she was\" confident \"in her attorney's arguments based on case law and a state Supreme Court decision.\" It would be nice to have a quick decision..., \"she said. Fischbach noted that seven male senators previously served as lieutenant governor while retaining their Senate seat. Asked if she believed the lawsuit could be politically motivated, Fischbach said,\" Well, it does have that potential. There has been potential for political motivation...through the entire kind of process. \"Dusosky, who has served as DFL chairwoman of the St. Cloud-area Senate district, denied any political motivation. Fischbach, as Senate president, automatically ascended to the lieutenant governor position after Gov. Mark Dayton appointed former Lt. Gov. <mark>Tina Smith</mark> to replace Al Franken in the U.S. Senate. The lawsuit's outcome could temporarily impact control of the state Senate. If the judge agrees with Dusosky and the DFL wins a special Senate election next week, the Senate would be split 33-33 between the GOP and DFL.\" What we're trying to say is: let's not wait for an issue and have lawsuits about votes and matter, \"Nauen said.\" Let's see if we can get it addressed right now. \"Nauen said at the hearing and in court filings that the state constitution prohibits Fischbach from keeping one foot in the legislative branch and the other in the executive branch of government, and that case law gives the court\" broad discretion \"to order her to give up her Senate seat. He told Guthmann in court that amendments to the state Constitution no longer permitted the dual offices. Magnuson argued in court that the amendments were\" minor tweaks \"that should not impact Fischbach. He also argued that the lieutenant governor has\" extremely limited \"legislative function and no constitutional duties other than to replace the governor if necessary. Guthmann asked about the office's other constitutional duties.\" ...inquire daily to the health of the governor, \"Magnuson said.\" Well, that'll make you look forward to getting up in the \"morning, Guthmann said.

There's a more blatant homage to the Fab Four in the LP that was sent out to Third Man Vault subscribers, but it's not in the grooves--it's in the cardboard. The lenticular cover that is exclusive to the Vault edition is adhesively applied to the LP jacket, as is the case with all 3D album sleeves. Since <mark>Jack White</mark>'s Third Man label is known for its packaging mischief, fans quickly wondered if there might be some different image underneath, and risked destroying their limited-edition covers to find out. It was worth the \"damage\" : what lies beneath is a dead-on parody of the Beatles' famous \"butcher cover.\" The cover-within-the-cover spoofs the Beatles' scandalous and withdrawn \"Yesterday and Today\" jacket nearly to the last detail. Related stories Album Review: The Raconteurs' \"Help Us Stranger' Third Man Records' 5 Greatest Moments, by Co-Founder Ben Blackwell Record Store Day Unveils 2019 Lineup Don't go looking for this version of\" Help Us Stranger \"at your nearest record store. It was only sent to those who sign up for a $60 quarterly subscription to the Vault, with orders having closed weeks before the record landed on doorsteps this weekend. The only way to pick up a copy now is on the resale market. A standard edition arrived in stores Friday. On the secret cover, the Third Man logo sits in the corner where the Capitol branding sat in 1966, and the typography for the album title and track listing appears identical. But if you want to credit the band members with going to the effort of finding the same lab coats, turtlenecks and wristwatches worn by the Beatles, not to mention cutting identically shaped slabs of beef and dismembering the same vintage dolls in the same fashion, do note that they appear to have skipped those steps and merely Photoshopped their heads onto <mark>John</mark>, Paul, <mark>George</mark> and Ringo's bodies. Like the Beatles, the Raconteurs split singer/songwriter duties between two primary frontmen. So if you've always wondered whether <mark>White</mark> considers himself the <mark>Lennon</mark> or McCartney of the group, this pose may provide a clue: In this recreation, at least, he's Paul, and Brendan Benson is <mark>John</mark>. That positioning, though, may have more to do with <mark>White</mark> as the likely ringleader of this particular prank, just as McCartney was the motivating force behind the avant-garde\" Yesterday and Today \"art. CREDIT: Chris Willman Related Stories Album Review: The Raconteurs'\" Help Us Stranger' Third Man Records' 5 Greatest Moments, by Co-Founder Ben Blackwell Record Store Day Unveils 2019 Lineup In 1966, the Beatles commissioned photographer <mark>Robert Whitaker</mark> to shoot a surreal cover image for \"Yesterday and Today,\" an odds-and-ends collection of singles and British album tracks that hadn't previously made it onto an American LP. The photographer \"knew we liked black humor and sick jokes,\" Paul McCartney said in the \"Anthology\" series. \"And he said,\" I have an idea--stick these <mark>white</mark> lab coats on .' It didn't seem too offensive to us. It was just dolls and a lot of meat. I don't really know what he was trying to say, but it seemed a little more original than the things the rest of the people were getting us to do. \"<mark>John Lennon</mark> tied the cover concept (which originally involved a much more elaborate triptych) to current events, saying,\" It's as relevant as Vietnam. If the public can accept something as cruel as the war, they can accept this cover. \"(The other popularly accepted explanation--that the Beatles were mad at Capitol for\" butchering \"their albums in the U.S.--appears never to have occurred to the group .) <mark>George Harrison</mark> was less enthused by the photo shoot, calling it\" gross \"and\" stupid. \"Nonetheless, Capitol Records went along with it--for a minute. It was reported that 60,000 copies were sent to stores before the label issued a recall the day before the album was to have gone on sale. A few copies were sold by stores anyway, but most were shipped back, as requested. The vast majority were destroyed, but so as not to delay the release of\" Yesterday and Today \"much further, Capitol took some of the existing LPs and pasted new, more generic cover art over the offensive image. Thus was born a cottage industry for Beatles collectors, in which pristine versions of the original\" Yesterday and Today \"cover have sold for as much as six figures, and copies with the cheerful cover still slapped on or professionally peeled off are worth thousands. Of course, not everyone steamed off the application with as much care, and damaged butcher covers can be had for the bargain price of a mere few hundred dollars. The manufacturing of the Raconteurs' parody cover appears to have damage built in.
