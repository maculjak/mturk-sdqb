overhauling the $2.5 trillion healthcare system sparked what promises to be a long and bitter debate over president barack obama's top domestic priority. the senate will vote on saturday night on whether to move to debate on the legislation--the first key procedural hurdle for the senate plan and one that requires 60 votes from the 100-member body. \"the finish line is in sight,\" <mark>reid</mark> said. \"i'm confident we'll cross it soon .\" whether democrats succeed depends on <mark>reid</mark>'s ability to keep his party's caucus intact. there is no room for error--democrats control exactly 60 votes, and republicans so far are united in opposition. <mark>reid</mark> dodged questions about whether he had the votes to move forward, telling reporters, \"we'll find out .\" if the senate agrees to take up the bill, the debate would begin on november 30, after next week's us thanksgiving holiday. it would last at least three weeks, making it unlikely obama can sign a final bill by the end of the year. any differences between a senate bill and the house of representatives version passed on november 7 would have to be reconciled before a final bill can be voted on again in both houses and sent to obama to sign. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated <mark>reid</mark>'s bill would cost $849 billion over 10 years--below obama's $900 billion target--reduce the budget deficit by $130 billion in the same period and extend insurance coverage to 31 million more people. the rosy report card from budget analysts could ease doubts about the bill among wavering moderate democrats, but republicans were not impressed. \"we've been warning the american people of the democrats\" plans to raise premiums, raise taxes, and slash medicare in order to fund more government, \"republican leader mitch mcconnell said. cheaper than house the senate bill is less expensive than a more than $1 trillion healthcare measure passed in the house, which would have covered at least 5 million more uninsured. like the house bill, the senate measure would require all americans to buy insurance and would set up exchanges where they could choose among various options. it also would offer subsidies to help low-income workers pay for the coverage. the senate bill includes a government-run insurance option that lets states choose whether to participate, and would halt industry practices like denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. some business trade groups were unhappy about the proposal, including america's health insurance plans, which represents the insurance industry, and the national federation of independent business, which represents small businesses .\" the new healthcare taxes and fees will raise the cost of coverage for individuals, families, and employers, \"said karen ignagni, president of america's health insurance plans. healthcare investors were mostly unconcerned about the senate bill as most provisions were expected, but a surprise proposal for a 5% tax on cosmetic treatments hurt companies such as allergan inc and medicis pharmaceutical corp. republicans criticised tax increases in the bill to help pay for the expanded insurance coverage, including the new tax on elective cosmetic surgery they dubbed a\" botox tax. \"the bill would also raise the medicare payroll tax on high-income workers, which is used to finance the government health program for the elderly, and impose a tax on high-cost\" cadillac \"insurance plans. mcconnell noted some of the bill's deficit reduction was possible because many of its provisions would not kick in until 2014, a year later than in the house bill .\" that's a little bit like being asked to pay your mortgage four years before you \"re allowed to move into your house,\" he said. three democratic senators--<mark>ben nelson</mark>, blanche lincoln and mary landrieu--are uncommitted on saturday's vote, although <mark>nelson</mark> and landrieu said they were encouraged by <mark>reid</mark>'s approach. <mark>nelson</mark> played down the vote's significance. \"it's a simple vote--to go forward with debate or not to go forward with debate,\" he said. \"even if you don't like the legislation, it's arguable you should go ahead. if you don't get it on the floor, you don't have any opportunity to amend it .\"

"content": "the group 1 semifinal between paulsboro and glassboro was billed as a showdown between two perennial powerhouse teams. it should have just been billed as \"the <mark>kevin johnson</mark> show,\" and as a comedy instead of a suspenseful drama. <mark>johnson</mark>, the paulsboro quarterback, led his team to a 28-point halftime lead and the red raiders eased into the group 1 state championship with a shocking 35-0 upset over the two-time defending state champs last night. \"we knew we had to make a statement early,\" said <mark>johnson</mark> who, in the first half, rushed four times for 72 yards and a touchdown while completing five of six passes for 127 yards. \"we lost to this team in the playoffs two years in a row, so we came out and really wanted this win tonight and we got it .\" after a scoreless first quarter, paulsboro running back eric mcmullen scored on a 5-yard run 52 seconds into the second quarter. that touchdown, like every other paulsboro drive in the first half, was set up by a huge play from <mark>johnson</mark>. after completing a 45-yard pass to sean mcclain on his team's first scoring drive, <mark>johnson</mark> opened up his team's next drive with a 54-yard touchdown run, putting paulsboro ahead 14-0 with 9:48 left in the half. \"he was just fantastic,\" said paulsboro coach <mark>glenn howard</mark>. \"returning punts, running the ball, throwing the ball, what can you say? we thought we'd have some opportunities to make some big plays today and [<mark>johnson</mark>] proved us right .\" while <mark>johnson</mark> was torching the glassboro defense, the paulsboro defense had little trouble containing a lifeless glassboro offense. after recording a first down on its first drive, the bulldogs went three-and-out on four of their next five drives stretching into the third quarter. glassboro did not record its second first down until after the mercy rule had taken effect with paulsboro ahead, 35-0. \"our defensive plan was that we knew we had to shut down [glassboro running back <mark>paul james</mark>],\" <mark>howard</mark> said. <mark>james</mark> finished with 92 yards on 15 carries. \"he's an outstanding back, and he

november 24, 2009, 8:08 am south east \"tradie\" ben hooper took out dual gold in fitting and turning categories when medals were presented on friday night at tafe sa's mount gambier campus for the region's worldskills australia competition. dubbed the \"olympics for tradies\" , the south east event featured 13 categories, ranging from welding to hairdressing and information technology, run across the region from june to october. competitors came from across the limestone coast, including mount gambier, millicent, beachport, kingston se, penola, naracoorte, lucindale, bordertown and western victoria. project manager andrew knowles said 160 people, representing the trades, government, business and other sectors attended the presentation night, which featured guest speaker and past national gold medallist jodie taylor. gold, silver and bronze medals were presented in each category, which also included beauty, metal fabrication, machining, carpentry, electrical, construction and business services, gold medal winners will compete in the national championships in brisbane next year, with winners earning the chance to represent the nation as part of the \"skillaroos\" at the world championships in london against 50 other countries. ms taylor, who had success in the business services category, is from the south east, which has showed continued dominance in the sector with fellow regional entrant nikita block winning nationally last year and now on a scholarship in london. mr knowles said the competition gave people aged under 23 an opportunity to test their skills against their peers, with the challenges stepping up at national and world level. \"it gives a good indication of the health of our trades,\" he said, adding that 143 people competed in the regional heats. \"the regionals are a serious step-up from what they do in their normal learning and the intensity will be up again at the nationals for the 13 gold medallists who can now continue on - the world titles is obviously much bigger again .\" regional competitions are held every two years and mr knowles said the south east event had two additional categories this year and was expected to continue to grow, with up to 40 sections available. \"it depends on what we have in numbers to run competitions, but it is slowly building in the south east,\" he said. employment, training and

confirmed that difficult decisions will have to be made by council in relation to funding priorities throughout the shire now and in the future. council in 2009/10 has committed to borrowings for the first time since 1998 and its current management plan indicates deficit budgets until 2012/13. council's audit partner john o'malley of the morse group addressed councillors at the most recent council meeting where he gave an overview of the results of the financial year ended 30 june, 2009. he confirmed that council - like their counterparts throughout the state - are facing a number of challenges brought about by the global financial crisis. at the same time he said the auditors had qualified council's 2009 accounts on the basis that they were unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence to satisfy them that the valuation of the $7,081,000 structured securities held by council at balance date as being of \"fair value .' this type of qualification has been given to a number of council's within nsw that hold securities that are similar to those held by parkes shire council. it was noted that this qualification was also applied to the 2008 financial reports and did not indicate council had not taken\" all necessary steps to ensure that the valuation of the investment securities had been undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards .' mr o'malley stated the overall result for the year had been substantially affected by the impact of fair value changes upon council's structured investments. a write-down of $5,339,000 in investment fair values for the financial year had a major impact on council's operating loss before capital items of $715,000. the decline in investments has also had a significant impact on council's reserves. current reserves stand at $5,446,000, the lowest since 2000/2001 ($5,045,000). les finn (council's director of corporate services) said this aspect had major implications for council's forward planning. \"especially given the assessed level of impairment that exists in respect of some council investments,\" mr finn said. \"whilst the valuations of council's investments have improved early in the current financial year the ultimate goal is to achieve a full return of the principal invested at maturity .\" \"with major infrastructure challenges facing council over the next few years and the acknowledgement that deficit budgets cannot be sustained in the medium to long term, sound financial decisions will need to be made if council is to continue to maintain services at the current level,\" mr finn said. \"the enormity of this challenge should not be underestimated and is an issue that is not unique to parkes shire council and confronted by council's australia wide .\" \"outstanding\" rates increase other highlights of the audit included an increase in the percentage of outstanding rates and annual charges for 2008/09 from 7.03 per cent to 7.34 per cent. this was regarded as a good result giving the staffing changes that had occurred in the rating and revenue section together with the difficult economic conditions that had prevailed over the course of the year. mr finn said council was considering a sale of land for unpaid rates in the next 12 months which should improve the ratio. increased assets council's net assets increased by $10,929,000 over the course of the year. this included a net operating result for the year of $4,561,000 and an asset revaluation reserve movement of $6,368,000. \"the movement of the asset revaluation was attributable to the revaluation of council's water and sewerage assets in accordance with the office of water indexation,\" mr finn reported. cash-flow decrease total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $10,705,000 over the course of the year. mr finn reported the reduction in cash was the result of council investing in short-term securities with a maturity of greater than 90 days. however, cashflow from operations was strong, generating $12,753,000 over the year. \"these funds were used to purchase or construct $12,103,000 in infrastructure assets and property, plant and equipment,\" he said. \"infrastructure assets expenditure was increased over past years due to the construction of the tullamore sewerage scheme, with $1.7 m spent on the scheme over the course of the year .\" - - - - - - mayor of parkes cr ken keith extended thanks on behalf of council to mr o'malley and his audit team for their assistance and patience over the course of the audit. \"the complexity of council's financial reports has grown substantially over recent years and this has added an additional burden to both council and audit staff,\" cr keith said. he particularly congratulated general manager

president obama will not be wearing a flight suit when he addresses the cadets at west point on tuesday night. nor will he wear a bomber jacket with the presidential seal on the chest, nor even, the white house promises, a windbreaker with the word army in big letters. \"you can count on no military garb,\" assures dan pfeiffer, the white house communications director. mission accomplished? not entirely. one of the common complaints of george w. bush's presidency was his tendency to politicize the military and turn troops into props. the man seemed to make more appearances before military audiences than bob hope did. but now obama is antagonizing many in his party with an expected announcement that he is sending more troops to afghanistan, and, to rub it in, he's making the announcement at one of bush's favorite military locations: the u.s. military academy at west point--the very birthplace, seven years ago, of the bush doctrine. obama's fondness for audiences in uniform is not yet in the same category as his predecessor's. beyond the infamous \"top gun\" landing aboard the uss abraham lincoln, and the thanksgiving turkey he served to troops in iraq, bush routinely used military-themed backdrops for his speeches: fighter jets, camouflage nets, american flags, military bands and, best of all, thousands of troops applauding or shouting \"hoo-ah\" at the right moments. still, obama's flirtation with military imagery should be of concern to his allies on the left, who are already unhappy with the hawkish direction his afghanistan policy has taken. already in his young presidency, the nobel peace prize winner has addressed the troops at osan air base in south korea, elmendorf air force base in alaska, naval air station jacksonville in florida, the u.s. naval academy in annapolis and nellis air force base in nevada. (for different purposes, he also spoke at the memorial for shooting victims at fort hood and welcomed home the remains of troops at dover air base .) the vice president and the first lady, in turn, have made the rounds at half a dozen other facilities. presidential addresses to the uniformed military were relatively rare before 2002, when bush went to west point for a june 1 speech to the cadets detailing the doctrine of preemptive war. had sarah palin watched that speech, she would have avoided four of the most damaging words of the 2008 presidential campaign, uttered when abc news's charlie gibson asked whether she agreed with the bush doctrine: \"in what sense, charlie?\" in the last days of his presidency, bush returned to west point for another speech, reminding everybody about his forgotten doctrine. by then, he had delivered dozens of speeches before crowds of soldiers and sailors under his command. at eglin air force base in florida, he wore a bomber jacket and used air force one as his backdrop. at macdill air force base in florida, he appeared in a hangar with fighter jets, flags, military banners and troops. then, of course, came the aircraft carrier landing on an s-3b viking, for which bush trained in the white house swimming pool, and the premature \"mission accomplished\" banner. on and on went the speeches to the troops: wright-patterson air force base, the army war college, national defense university, fort hood, fort bragg, the air force academy. even his second inauguration, in 2005, served as a vehicle for bush to surround himself with all things military. as the televised speeches to military audiences became more frequent, so did the complaints of the opposition, which questioned the propriety of bush attacking democrats in front of the troops, who are not allowed to participate in political events while in uniform. predictably, the cry was picked up by the right after obama took office and continued the practice of speeches to the troops. two weeks ago, fox news's <mark>glenn beck</mark> played an image of obama speaking in front of uniformed soldiers and complained: \"i'm sick of it, especially when it comes to the soldiers. they are not props .\" but they are required to be loyal, and when their commander in chief talks, whether it's bush or obama, they salute. or applaud. or yell \"hoo-ah .\" and on tuesday night, this military pageantry will only compound the sense on the left that obama is not the man they thought he was. in an open letter to obama on his web site monday, liberal activist <mark>michael moore</mark> wrote that by increasing troops in afghanistan, \"you will do the worst possible thing you could do--destroy the hopes and dreams so many millions have placed in you .\" \"with just one speech tomorrow night,\" <mark>moore</mark> continued, \"you will turn a multitude of young people who were the backbone of your campaign into disillusioned cynics. you will teach them what they've always heard is true--that all politicians are alike .\" post partisan quick takes from the post's opinion writers. washington sketch dana milbank writes about political theater in the capital.", "articleID": "2009113023_00192336_W", "names": {"Glenn Beck": ["Q21213245", "Q310618"], "Michael Moore": ["Q10430120", "Q174908", "Q1752903", "Q1928646", "Q20054072", "Q21166729", "Q333446", "Q40220120", "Q47468073", "Q59154912", "Q5992831", "Q6832887", "Q6832890", "Q6832891", "Q6832892"]}}]
