all she's done for him, either: he asked her to swing by an event at the vfw and she where it all went wrong: the top-ranking house republican told reporters on monday that he regrets having supported former gop house candidate dede scozzafava...\"this lady clearly has as agenda that's different than most republicans; she was out there promoting herself,\" house minority leader john boehner (r-ohio) said, noting that he has encouraged all members of the gop conference to support conservative party candidate doug hoffman. way to piece it together, jb. the irony here is that it's moderate republicans who'll end up being the big losers from scozzafava's betrayal. not only does she make them look untrustworthy (or rather, more untrustworthy than before) but increasingly it seems like they're not even going to get hoffman's scalp as a consolation prize. check out this eye-popper from the crosstabs to today's hoffman's favorable rating among scozzafava voters is now 35/41, a 15/57 on saturday). by comparison, owens's favorable rating among them has shifted from 19/50 on saturday to...20/52 now. clearly her supporters are breaking towards the conservative - or were. the question is what her stumping for owens will do to those relative support levels. i'm generally fine with the big tent approach, but no tent would've been big enough to cover dede. he is a weak, feckless leader that is incapable of articulating conservative principles. he supported scuzzy from the beginning, not hoffman. blarg the destroyer on november 2, 2009 at 6:23 pm apparently you haven't been keeping up with what jb has been doing in the house lately. he's the strongest voice we have against the lefty obamabots and their agenda. but that is what is wrong and just what i said. he (boehner) chose party over principle. big orange on november 2, 2009 at 6:21 pm jb did not \"choose party over principle\" ...remember, before all the hoopla, no one knew a \"ny-23 \u2020 \u00b3 even existed, much less who was running. boehner didn't knowingly endorse scozzy...he simply didn't back hoffman, since he wasn't running on the gop ticket. jb realizes hoffman is the right choice, and endorses him now. don't see the problem with that. * oops.... quote fail...jetboy on november 2, 2009 at p.s. i predict a hoffman/scuzzo rematch in november 2010. buzzcrutcher on november 2, 2009 at 5:55 pm no way. scuzzofalafel is toast. no one will trust a turncoat. you can buy her off for a while if it serves your purpose but she won't win your affection for a betrayal - even if you're the beneficiary. ironically, her best response would've been to support hoffman, hope he loses and then she becomes a viable candidate for 2010; but she's a loser and has no future in politics. boehner endorsed scuzzyfever. but he was redeemed by sarah, and is now on the sarah/hoffman bandwagon. i am willing to forgive boehner, but not newt. norwegian on november 2, 2009 at 6:23 pm john boehner does not need redemption from sarah palin. as rush limbaugh said...she's guilty of wide-spread bestiality. she has screwed all rinos, current and future. and that's a good thing. enoxo on november 2, 2009 at 5:36 pm so right. and what he said pelosi killing the blue dogs, and how peta should get involved...classis rush. the fact that the republicans chose her over hoffman says volumes about what boehner and other party leaders thought. he has no spine at all. he is a perfect example of what is wrong. he could have gotten behind hoffman from the start but he went with gingrich and <mark>steele</mark>. big orange on november 2, 2009 at 6:00 pm boehnor had absolutely nothing to do with picking her. maybe he should have interfered, but who could have imagined the local gop leaders would be this f * cking stupid? and people generally don't like interference from\" outsiders \"(just ask newt ...) this is part of the bigger problem with republican leadership-that boehner supported her in the first place. should we re-gain of the house, i would not want boehner to be speaker. john boehner does not need redemption from sarah palin. jetboy on november 2, 2009 at 6:38 pm i guess that's why he sent her multiple\" thank you!' - messages over twitter right after sarah gave her blessing for his health care speech. this is part of the bigger problem with republican leadership-that boehner supported her in the first place. should we re-gain of the house, i would not want boehner to be speaker. varnson on november 2, 2009 at 6:40 pm speaker michele bachman has a nice ring to it. joeintx: \"thank goodness the gop leaders have enormous grasp of the obscenely obvious, er, in hindsight .\" only if mike huckabee and mitt romney don't count as gop leaders, since both of them are still in hiding on this. brave, brave sir robins, both of them. and for those who hype their credentials as conservative leaders, compared to sarah palin: heartache. david blue on november 2, 2009 at but that is what is wrong and just what i said. he (boehner) chose party over principle. big orange on november 2, 2009 at 6:21 pm well, he is a party leader, so that may have something to do with it. boehner has his shortcoming, but the decsion to blow a bunch of money on scuzzy was made by the rnc and the rncc, neither of which boehner leads. automated message by conservatives for the 2010 and 2012 elections: (cankles voice in drawn out hiss) \"sssssssscooooooozzzzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaafffffffffaaaaaaaavvvvvvaaaaaa ...!\" i guess that's why he sent her multiple \"thank you!' - messages over twitter right after sarah gave her blessing for his health care speech. norwegian on november 2, 2009 at 6:43 pm oh, dear lawdy...saint sarah must give her blessings...a\" thank you \"for agreeing with boehner's health care speech is hardly\" redemption \". boehner has been working his arse off over health care, not only fighting obamacare, but coming up with a gop proposal to fix what needs fixing, and highlighting what works. palin had nothing to do with it. jetboy on november 2, 2009 at jetboy on november 2, 2009 at 6:36 pm and that is a problem. he is a weak leader. he threw his support behind a pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-card check, tax raising democrat running as a republican. you say he is the strongest voice we have right now. i agree with you, and that is the problem. he, along with <mark>michael steele</mark>, need to submit their resignations on wednesday and let real conservatives run the show. blarg the destroyer on november 2, 2009 at who cares about principles? neither of the two parties! all they care about is maintaining their power and the 2 party system. i'm generally fine with the big tent approach, but no tent would've been big enough to cover dede. packerbronco on november 2, 2009 at 6:33 pm if you've ever been to africa, it's hard to throw a tent over a rino. but scooooooooooozafava is the moderate republican who can win election for republican, right? like snowe collins etc. moderates are acids to conservative image. not the other way around. oh, dear lawdy...saint sarah must give her blessings...a\" thank you \"for agreeing with boehner's health care speech is hardly\" redemption \". boehner has been working his arse off over health care, not only fighting obamacare, but coming up with a gop proposal to fix what needs fixing, and highlighting what

thing by a big margin. what do you want to bet that she shows up on odumbo's guest list? are you a catholic? americannodash on november 2, 2009 at 6:54 pm yep...not sure what that has to do with anything tho...john boehner: scuzzyfever has my full support eh, it wasn't for sarah, boehner would be a dead man walking right now. norwegian on november 2, 2009 at 6:58 pm that doesn't show that boehner was campaigning for her...only that fort drum, in her district, would be of importance. that's why he would put her on the asc if she won. scozzafava said fort drum, which encompasses a large part of the congressional district, is vitally important to her constituents, and said boehner's desire to put her on the committee shows he recognizes its importance. he'll do the same for hoffman i presume. jetboy on november 2, 2009 at 7:08 pm and some people call us the stupid party...get a grip man. boehner blew it. he failed conservatives and conservatism with his support of scuzzwuzzy. how hard is that to see? blarg the destroyer on november 2, 2009 at all boehner does is carry huge stacks of democrat paper around washington, drop them on desks and podiums with a thud, and exclaim about how big they are. what a dunce. yep...not sure what that has to do with anything tho...jetboy on november 2, 2009 at 7:05 pm as a catholic you should know better then to call her a saint. stop calling sarah palin a saint. she is an american who speaks with conviction of the core principles of life, liberty & the pursuit of hapiness. when you call her a saint all it does is weaken any statement provided by you. let's wait for when the pope decides she is worthy. john boner!!! - no duh!! what the hell - leaders who follow instead of lead end up with ny pigeon doo doo all over their camera mugging profiles. time to stop following your rino elites from ny and dc and start heading home to listen to your constituents. maybe you would have backed the right candidate from the start. or start following the lead of the new bloods (palin, phawenty, instead of the country club's ass kissers like newt! the irony here is that it's moderate republicans who'll end up being the big losers from scozzafava's betrayal. not only does she make them look untrustworthy (or rather, more untrustworthy than before) but increasingly it seems like they're not even going to get hoffman's scalp as a consolation prize. consolation prize? every single republican\" moderate \"should be made to stand in the corner with a dunce cap, and write\" i am not a socialist statist \"500 times on the hey newt-see if you can borrow the\" reset button \"from hilary. the irony here is that it's moderate republicans who'll end up being the big losers from scozzafava's betrayal. not only does she make them

more than the skin on his teeth, well its not skin, more like a film of bacterial growth or something. boehner would have done a lot better if a couple of weeks ago he spent some time on hotair...we are not a bunch of posters fiddling around. we are the backbone of the conservative movement. many of us have differing opinions...but we can all analyze. he, and others, need to spend a few hours a day, cruising through the posts...we were right on bush, mccain, palin, hoffman. right on the tea party's, right on health care. get you nose out of newt's butt, and read what the real people are saying. question: isn't scuzzy the epitome of what <mark>glenn beck</mark> has been talking about with regard to how there is no difference between the dems and the reps? the parties are one and the same. they want to keep each other in power and keep out anyone who's not in the loop. or else clearly she was a demo dressed as a rep just like snowe and collins are in the northeast. time to clean house and get some new blood in there. amen!! nothing says vote for me! quite as loudly as a 265 pound, butch-haired woman in a pink pantsuit. she's all yours, dnc. jaibones on november 2, 2009 at

last year's mr. basketball and minnesota's top freshman this season, was arrested by bloomington police officers oct. 13 on charges of shoplifting and fifth-degree assault at macy's in the mall of america. gophers coach tubby smith said today that he suspended white indefinitely for an unspecified violation of team rules, but did not elaborate on the reasons for the disciplinary action. a macy's security officer confronted white, who was with three other males, and tried to handcuff the 6-foot-8, 240-pound power forward, who allegedly stole $100 worth of merchandise. according to a police report, white pushed the security guard \"down to the ground two times .\" bloomington officers eventually arrived and arrested white, who was released with a citation. white was also issued a one-year trespass notice by security officials at the mall of america, according to the police. bloomington police cmdr. <mark>jim ryan</mark> said people who commit the crimes that white's been accused of don't usually serve jail time. white, one of the nation's most highly recruited high school players last season, played for basketball-powerhouse hopkins during his senior year of high school after being dismissed from de la salle during his junior season. smith also has suspended senior guard devron bostick, who was not involved in the mall of america situation. smith said they'll be held out of exhibitions thursday (against minnesota duluth) and monday (against minnesota state moorhead) and possibly more, until smith decides they're ready to return to the no. 25-ranked gophers. \"it could be two games. it could be five, six. it could be more,\" smith said, adding: \"it could be 20. it depends on what i want, what i decide .\" bostick is a reserve who averaged 11 minutes per game last season. white is part of a touted recruiting class that includes transfer trevor mbakwe, who is also out indefinitely while a felony aggravated battery charge against him goes

current mood: i predicted before last november that we're in for a surprise, because people are fed up with the same old thing. i also predicted that if things didn't change after the election, there would be consequences to pay. i think we're seeing that. i also think we're seeing the backlash i predicted against liberalism in this country. homosexual marriage was voted down in maine, a really liberal state. virginia went republican, and the extremely liberal state of new jawsey went republican. liberals can laugh all they want at the tea parties, but they're working. i predict after 2010, liberals will be laughing out of the other side of their collective faces. obama (d) has not delivered the change he promised. he has done the same as any other politician: he's lied to us. but this time it's different, because he's lied big. really big. but i put this to those who did not vote for obama (d). why is anyone surprised by his actions? he told us exactly what he was made of. we knew he had zero experience. we laughed at those who believed he went to a church where the preacher spewed racist hate. obama (d) went to that church for 20 years and managed to convince doe eyed zombies he didn't hear any racism coming from reverend wright. during the campaign, he refused to respect america, our troops and our country by not saluting our flag. we knew it. we all knew what he was. he did that childish thing with scratching his chin and flipping off president <mark>bush</mark>. we knew he was childish. we knew he played childish games. yet america elected him, because he promised change and america said \"ok, we'll fall for it one more time, but if you lie to us...\"so here we are. we know why obama (d) wants to shove through all these bills right now. because he knows there's a storm coming. each and every time he gets up and talks about the health care overhaul, people protest it more and more, and people are more and more against it. he appoints these people to his cabinet who are the most extreme radicals ever to hold a cabinet post. and then he whines like a little titty baby when people find out and complain, and his appointment is forced to resign. he wants us to accept his version of\" change \". the fact is, the majority of this country define themselves as\" conservative \". not republican. but conservative. and that's something liberals have a hard time digesting. after obama (d) was elected, all the pundits weeped with joy that the country finally and totally shifted to the left. that was just wrong, and they had no proof of it. obama (d) was handed the election at the right time. god forbid john mccain should run a decent campaign. just as <mark>john kerry</mark> gave the election to president <mark>bush</mark>, mccain did his dead level best to make sure obama (d) ran pretty much on skates. obama (d) was elected because everything fell in place for him. i'd call it the closest thing to luck as anything could be. call it the great american experiment. it was just time to do something different. if you read my blogs, at one point i was for obama (d). but that quickly changed once i saw what he is. a liar. a thief. a child who has absolutely no business running this country. much less into the ground. the only thing that can help obama (d) in 2010 is if he shifts more to the center. like ex president clinton did. instead of protecting our troops, obama (d) sits at his desk and picks little girly fights with fox news. nancy pelosi (d) and her cohorts celebrated with glee after they came up with their own health care overhaul bill. all 2,000 pages of it. it reminds me of the time democrats celebrated on the floor after they passed their huge tax increase. that next term, in' 94, they paid with their jobs. democrats are worried about their jobs in 2010. and a notice has been sent to the sitting republicans who refuse to listen to their constituents. democrats swore if we gave them the house and senate, they'd clean things up and make everything right. they have so much control, they could pass any bill they wanted, unchallenged. republicans can't even fight it. but democrats can't even agree on one single measure. democrats swore there would be more transparency if we would just give them the house and senate. all they've done since is have meetings behind closed doors, and refuse to post bills on line so everyone can see what's being voted on. instead, they attack <mark>glenn beck</mark> and bill o'reilly. democrats swore they would\" clean up the swamp \"if we would just give them control of the house and senate. now we find out the democrats are more corrupt than anyone imagined. obama (d) can't even find an appointment that's paid their taxes. this country gave obama (d) and democrats what they wanted. ever see the movie\" casino \"? remember joe pesci's character was narrating and he said\" we had it all. paradise. we could do anything we wanted and no one could touch us, and we managed to screw that up \". you screwed up democrats, and now you have to face the music. you had your chance, you had your way. not only did you manage to screw things up, but we managed to learn about it on a daily basis, despite your efforts to shut down free speech. well i cant help but laugh. nobody's riding obama's coattails to victory! you just wait till next year. if the dems up for re-election are smart, they might want to distance themselves from obama. you hit the nail on the head from the get go. good for you and i totally agree.", "articleID": "2009110514_00156318_W",

rodia, watts towers are a famous example of vernacular architecture, located in the watts district, los angeles. the talented construction worker spent all his spare time, between 1921 and 1954, working on this collection of 17 interconnected steel towers. the amateur structures are made from steel rods wrapped in wire and coated in mortar. rodia decorated his architectural masterpieces with

\"other upside down house\" is located on usedom, an island in northern germany. it was financed and constructed by polish partners klausdiusz golos and sebastian mikiciuk, who just wanted to make something different. only, i wonder if they know a practically identical house already exists in their native country of poland. the builders said they were inspired by similar structures in america and spain, that were upside down on the outside, but normal on the inside. visitors of the \"other upside-down house\" said the weird interior make them feel dizzy and disoriented. there's no questioning china's economic boom, but although more and more impressive buildings are being constructed every day, there are some areas that don't even have a proper school. dongzhong (literally translated as \"in cave\" ) is a elementary school located in miao village, china's guizhou province. the strange thing about this learning institution is that it's housed by a giant cave, carved inside a mountain over thousands of years, by wind, rain and earthquakes. there is a small structure put together by the locals, but children attend classes protected only by the cold walls of the cave. adrian reeman, a former merchant navy chef from southampton, has spent the last 23 years of his life transforming his small apartment into a miniature palace of versailles. his painstaking work began in 1986, when he moved in with his wife annette, in the ninth floor flat of a tower bloc in southampton. he hated the copper pebble dash wallpaper he found there and decided something had to be done. at first he just started panelling the walls, without having a clue of what it was going to turn into. although he has no training in constructions or design, and he has never once visited the real versailles, adrian reeman managed to create an honorable small-scale replica of the popular french palace. he now sees no reason to visit the real thing, since he's living in it himself, just on a slightly smaller scale. reeman says he's not 100% happy with how the versailles apartment i've seen some pretty bizarre-but-impressive treehouses in my day, but the minister's house is by far the most impressive, if only through its sheer size. located in crossville, tennessee, the minister's house took horace burgess 14 years to build around an 80-foot-tall white oak tree, with a diameter of 12 feet. the wooden edifice itself is 97-feet-tall and it's supported by six other strong trees that act like natural pillars. burgess says he started working on this giant treehouse after he had a vision back in 1993. god spoke to him and said: \"treehouse, i'll see you never run out of material .\" and so he spent the next 14 years building god's treehouse, using only salvaged materials, like pieces of lumber from garages, storage sheds and barns. so, as far as horace is concerned, god did provide him with all the materials he needed. although he never bothered to measure minister's house (he estimates it must be about 8,000 to 10,000 square feet), he did count the nails he had to hammer into it, 258,000. it cost the 56-year-old landscape architect around $12,000 to construct the world's biggest treehouse. 400-500 people visit minister's house every week, most of them tourists from out of state who heard about a 10-story-treehouse somewhere in tennessee. forced by the downfall of the american housing market, fred milani had to put his backyard replica of the white house up for sale, for just $10 million. american iranian property developer, fred milani, says he doesn't really want to sell his beloved replica of the iconic white house, but he has to. the mini-house is built in the backyard of his atlanta residence and comes complete with its very own oval office and lincoln bedroom, as well as a backdoor pool. if you're expecting an interesting story about how mr. milani decided to have the white house replica built in his backyard, you're in for a big disappointment. he just wanted a house and the architect just asked him \"how about i build you the white house?\" , he agreed and the rest is history. who doesn't want to live in a happy house, right? i bet that's what designer james rizzi thought to himself when he designed the happy rizzi house, in brunswick, germany. what is it with germans and wacky-looking houses? after the famous waldspirale of darmstadt, i've discovered the happy rizzi house, where pop-art ant cartoons mix to form a very unique architectural design. built by architect konrad kloster, happy rizzi house is one of the most important monuments in brunswick. in the hills near san chih, northern taiwan, lies the seashell temple, one of the most amazing architectural works in the world. i'm sure many of you have

chicago, got the idea of turning a missile silo into a comfortable home in the mid '80s, while watching the johnny carson show. one of the guest had actually set up a home inside a nuclear missile base and bruce just knew that's he wanted for himself. it wasn't until 1997 that he actually got his hands on a missile silo, but since then he turned into real dream house. the living space is around 1,000 square feet and is basically a huge concrete bubble suspended from a central pole. he did a nice job decorating, but he also kept some of the old stuff around, like the massive blast doors. the owner says his missile silo home couldn't withstand a nuclear strike these days, but it handles the strong texas storms just fine. it's amazing how popular wine-corks are these days. some people convert their cars into wine-cork costumes and even insulate their houses. check out this located in fafe, portugal, this unusual stone house bears a remarkable resemblance to the flintstones house. man, i loved that show! i know what you're thinking and you're not the only one, but as fake as these photos may look, the stone house of fafe is very real. i mean it's even been featured in the daily mail. ok, you're right, that's not a valid argument, but this house does exist. the photos taken by jsome1 have been causing quite stir on the internet, partly because he decided to improve the photos a little and make them look fake-ish. but other curious web-surfers have been digging around and found the stone house exists and it's actually a local landmark of the fafe region. the last two photos were used to promote the fafe biking marathon and feature the also known as \"casas colgadas\" , the hanging houses are the most popular attractions of cuenca, spain. the history and exact origin of the hanging houses is unclear. some believe they are of muslim origin, while others say they are medieval. centuries ago, this kind of building was frequently seen throughout cuenca, but nowadays only three \"casas colgadas\" remain, built in a cliff, above huecar gorge. located in darmstadt, germany, the waldspirale apartment-building was designed by austrian artist, friedensreich hundertwasser, and built during the 1990s. there are other apartment buildings in darmstadt, but the u-shaped waldspirale is special. its diagonal roof is covered with grass, shrubs and trees and the facade follows an irregular grid organization. waldspirale has over 1,000 windows, but no two are the same. the handles on the apartment doors and the windows are also unique. personally i think it has a shot at the title of weirdest hotel in the world, but it's definitely not the best looking one. located in hebei province, china, the tianzi hotel was built sometime in the 2000-2001 period. it is a ten-story high representation of <mark>fu lu</mark> shou (good fortune, prosperity and longevity) that apparently holds the guinness world record for the \"biggest image building\" ...whatever that means. you probably won't find much more info about the and it's not just for show guys, people actually live in it! ever since he was a little boy, simon dale dreamed of having a house in the countryside. and even though he's no architect, or even a construction worker, together with his father-in-law and the help of passers-by, simon managed to build this amazing hobbit house in just 4 months. believe it or not this baby only cost around 3,000 pounds to build. though it looks absolutely incredible, aesthetics were not mr. dale's primary concerns. he tried to make his dream home as environment-friendly as he possibly could and hopes he set an example for others. simon dale and his family actually moved into the hobbit house, but they are not stopping here. their next project involves building nine other similar houses in pembrokeshire, britain. \"dug into hillside for low visual impact and shelter stone and mud from diggings used for retaining walls, foundations etc. frame of oak thinnings
