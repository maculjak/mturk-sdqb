SISAK and JENNIFER PELTZ - 11/29/18 9:39 PM Tweet on Twitter NEW YORK--In the latest push to have Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault case thrown out, the movie producer's lawyer said Thursday that a woman accusing him of a 2013 rape pressured a friend to corroborate her account, but that the friend wouldn't\" make up a story. \"The friend told defense investigators that Weinstein and the rape accuser had been\" hooking up \"consensually for a long time and that she never heard the accuser say anything bad about him until last year, lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a court filing. The friend was not identified in court papers. Weinstein's side also believes police set up a phone call between the film producer and one of his accusers shortly before his arrest, but the operation failed to produce incriminating evidence.\" The only reasonably prudent decision would be to stop this chaos now, \"Brafman wrote, urging Judge <mark>James Burke</mark> to dismiss the case at a Dec. 20 court hearing. The Manhattan District Attorney's office declined to comment. In a filing last week, prosecutors said there was\" ample evidence \"to move forward and that Brafman was trying to create a\" public circus \"with an earlier demand that police investigators be questioned in court about alleged misconduct that has roiled the case. Prosecutors dropped part of the case in October after evidence surfaced that a detective coached a witness. Three of the five remaining charges stem from the allegations at the heart of Brafman's latest filing, that Weinstein raped a woman in a hotel room in March 2013. The two other charges allege that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on another woman in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment. Brafman said the rape accuser called the friend out of the blue after they hadn't spoken since a falling-out two years before. She discussed the alleged assault and asked for the friend's help,\" presumably so as to serve as a prompt outcry witness, \"Brafman wrote. An\" outcry witness \"is a term for the first person or people who were told about an alleged attack. Such testimony can be powerful in a sexual assault case. The friend responded that she'd never been told about the allegation and didn't want to get involved, according to the filing. But sometime after, a New York City police detective approached her about the matter. She told the detective that the accuser, who has never been publicly identified, and Weinstein had an intimate relationship and that she'd never heard the assault allegation at the time, according to the court papers. Brafman blasted authorities for not passing the information to the defense. Weinstein, 66, denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex. What first appeared to be a strong case against Weinstein, brought in the glow of the #MeToo movement as dozens of women came forward to accuse him of wrongdoing, has been dinged by back-to-back allegations of police misconduct. First, prosecutors dropped a criminal charge involving a third woman after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio coached a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegation. Days later, prosecutors revealed that DiGaudio allegedly urged the rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before she handed them over to prosecutors. The woman didn't delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice, prosecutors said. DiGaudio's union has said he\" was simply trying to get to the truth \"and wasn't trying to influence the investigation. He is no longer involved in the Weinstein case. Brafman, in the filing, said Weinstein was caught in the middle of a public feud between the New York Police Department and the district attorney's office. He said that police had pressured prosecutors into charging Weinstein by publicly demanding an arrest and indictment and talking openly to reporters about witnesses and purported evidence. After the flood of sex misconduct claims against Weinstein last year, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. came under heavy scrutiny for declining to charge him over an Italian model's allegation that he groped her in 2015. Police also set up a sting in that investigation, and the model later recorded an in-person encounter in which she confronted Weinstein. He alternated between apologizing and trying to persuade her to go to his hotel room. The New York Police Department on Thursday reiterated its statement that\" the evidence against Mr. Weinstein is compelling and strong \"and that it will continue to work with prosecutors\" to deliver justice for the courageous survivors who have bravely come forward. \"Earlier this week, a Delaware bankruptcy court judge granted Weinstein's lawyers access to thousands of emails on his former movie studio's servers that they say discredit his accusers. Brafman said he's preparing for the possibility that prosecutors will try and bolster their flagging case by portraying Weinstein as a serial predator and telling jurors about allegations against him that didn't lead to criminal charges. Brafman referred to that step as a\" Cosby motion, \"after the disgraced comedian who was convicted in April of drugging and assaulting a woman in 2004 after prosecutors were allowed to call five witnesses who said he had victimized them in similar fashion. Brafman said in Thursday's court filing that the emails\" demonstrate that these women who now allege sexual assault by Mr. Weinstein have for years engaged in loving and often intimate conversations with him before and after the date of the alleged assault. \"Follow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Peltz at twitter.com/JennPeltz TAGS"}, {"articleID": "2015011620_00044819_W", "names": {"Michael Bradley": ["Q1619538", "Q208425", "Q3308051", "Q55998165", "Q6828781", "Q6828782", "Q6828785", "Q9032247"]}, "date": "2015-01-16", "url": "http://wsoctv.com/ap/ap/sports/toronto-acquires-altidore-sends-defoe-to-sunderlan/njqLd", "content": "Updated: 3:29 p.m. Friday, Jan. 16, 2015 | Posted: 3:29 p.m. Friday, Jan. 16, 2015 TORONTO - Jozy Altidore and <mark>Michael Bradley</mark> grew up less than 50 miles apart in northern New Jersey, playing alongside each other on U.S. national youth teams. Now veterans of two World Cups each, the duo has been reunited as teammates with Toronto in Major League Soccer. \"Canada, who would have thought it, huh?\" Altidore said with a laugh Friday when introduced as Toronto's newest designated player. \"That's the thing about life, you never know what you're going to get the next day.\" Toronto confirmed the acquisition of the forward from Sunderland of England's Premier League and agreed to transfer English forward Jermain Defoe to the Black Cats, one year after obtaining him from Tottenham. Altidore said <mark>Bradley</mark>, the midfielder who joined Toronto along with Defoe in January 2014, was a \"huge\" part of his decision to sign with Toronto. \"We started at the youth national team together at 16, 17 years old,\" Altidore said. \"Every level we ascended to, we did it together. We were always close, always pushing each other from a young age. He was huge in this whole thing.\" <mark>Michael</mark>'s an honest guy, he's always been honest with me, \"Altidore added.\" He told me from the start \"Jozy, you will quickly see that this place, they have the same desire that we do, to get better and to kind of make a statement .' That's what we're all about in terms of growing and taking the game to a new height in North America. This is the perfect place to do that. There is no better place to do that.\" The 25-year-old Altidore played in MLS with the New York Red Bulls from 2006-08 before heading to Spain's Villarreal for a transfer fee of about $10 million. He failed to establish himself as a regular, spent time on loan at Xerez, Hull and Bursaspor before he was sold to the Netherlands' AZ Alkmaar. He set the record for goals by an American in a European club season with 31 for AZ in 2012-13, then went to Sunderland. He had just one goal in 40 league appearances with the Black Cats. \"The time at Sunderland was a difficult one for a lot of reasons,\" Altidore said. \"A lot of things went on behind the scenes that made it very tough to get off the ground there.\" Toronto coach Greg Vanney, a former U.S. national player, said he's confident Altidore's scoring drought won't continue in MLS. \"He will score goals. I have no concern about that,\" Vanney said. \"I have no doubt that he's going to be a great player and arguably the best striker in the league.\" General manager Tim Bezbatchenko called Altidore \"one of the top young Americans in the game today.\" Altidore was added to the U.S. training camp roster before upcoming exhibitions against Chile and Panama. <mark>Bradley</mark> and newly drafted Toronto goalleeper Alex Bono are also on the American roster. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann has previously expressed a preference for American players to test themselves against opponents in Europe's top leagues. Altidore discussed his move with Klinsmann and said the German coach was supportive of a return to MLS. \"I spoke to him at length,\" Altidore said. \"It was a very open, honest conversation. He understands that I'm a guy who's always pushing myself, always looking to get better. I think he supported this move a lot. He's obviously going to work closely with me and everybody at this organization to make sure that I put my best foot forward.\" Defoe scored 12 goals in 21 games with Toronto, but Bezbatchenko acknowledged \"friction\" with the former English, who missed much of the second half of the season with injury and returned home for treatment. Bezbatchenko referred to Altidore as \"a known entity.\" Boehner uses Taylor Swift GIFs to criticize Obama's community college plan Cox Media Group.

You remember how unpopular\" Obamacare' was when it passed? \"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky ., said in an interview, shrugging off polls showing scant public enthusiasm for the measure. He said the legislation would prove to be\" just what the country needs to get growing again. \"Presiding over the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence announced the 51-49 vote to applause from Republicans. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn ., was the only lawmaker to cross party lines, joining the Democrats in opposition. The measure focuses its tax reductions on businesses and higher-earning individuals, gives more modest breaks to others and offers the boldest rewrite of the nation's tax system since 1986. Republicans touted the package as one that would benefit people of all incomes and ignite the economy. Even an official projection of a $1 trillion, 10-year flood of deeper budget deficits couldn't dissuade GOP senators from rallying behind the bill.\" Obviously I'm kind of a dinosaur on the fiscal issues, \"said Corker, who battled to keep the bill from worsening the government's accumulated $20 trillion in IOUs. The Republican-led House approved a similar bill last month in what has been a stunningly swift trip through Congress for complex legislation that impacts the breadth of American society. The two chambers will now try crafting a final compromise to send Trump. After spending the year's first nine months futilely trying to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, GOP leaders were determined to move the measure rapidly before opposition Democrats and lobbying groups could blow it up. The party views passage as crucial to retaining its House and Senate majorities in next year's elections. Democrats derided the bill as a GOP gift to its wealthy and business backers at the expense of lower-earning people. They contrasted the bill's permanent reduction in corporate income tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent to smaller individual tax breaks that would end in 2026. Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has said the bill's reductions for many families would be modest and said by 2027, families earning under $75,000 would on average face higher, not lower, taxes. The bill is\" removed from the reality of what the American people need, \"said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. He criticized Republicans for releasing a revised, 479-page bill that no one can absorb shortly before the final vote, saying,\" The Senate is descending to a new low of chicanery. \"\"You really don't read this kind of legislation,\" Sen. <mark>Ron Johnson</mark>, R-Wis ., told home-state reporters, asked why the Senate was approving a bill some senators hadn't read. He said lawmakers needed to study it and get feedback from affected groups. Heather Long When Senate Republicans introduced their tax bill in mid-November, they faced competing interests: Some senators thought it wasn't generous enough for working-class families. Others thought it didn't deliver enough to business owners. As Republicans moved closer to a final vote on the bill Friday...When Senate Republicans introduced their tax bill in mid-November, they faced competing interests: Some senators thought it wasn't generous enough for working-class families. Others thought it didn't deliver enough to business owners. As Republicans moved closer to a final vote on the bill Friday...(Heather Long) Democrats took to the Senate floor and social media to mock one page that included changes scrawled in barely legible handwriting. Later, they won enough GOP support to kill a provision by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa ., that would have bestowed a tax break on conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan. The bill hit rough waters after the Joint Taxation panel concluded it would worsen federal shortfalls by $1 trillion over a decade, even when factoring in economic growth that lower taxes would stimulate. Trump administration officials and many Republicans have insisted the bill would pay for itself by stimulating the economy. But the sour projections stiffened resistance from some deficit-averse Republicans. But after bargaining that stretched into Friday, GOP leaders nailed down the support they needed in a chamber they control 52-48. Facing unyielding Democratic opposition, Republicans could lose no more than two GOP senators and prevail with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, but ended up not needing it. Leaders' changes included helping millions of companies whose owners pay individual, not corporate, taxes on their profits by allowing deductions of 23 percent, up from 17.4 percent. That helped win over Wisconsin's <mark>Johnson</mark> and Steve Daines of Montana. People would be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, a demand of Sen. <mark>Susan Collins</mark> of Maine. That matched a House provision that chamber's leaders included to keep some GOP votes from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. The changes added nearly $300 billion to the tax bill's costs. To pay for that, leaders reduced the number of high-earners who must pay the alternative minimum tax, rather than completely erasing it. They also increased a one-time tax on profits U.S.-based corporations are holding overseas and would require firms to keep paying the business version of the alternative minimum tax. Jeff Stein High-ranking Republicans are hinting that, after their tax overhaul, the party intends to look at cutting spending on welfare, entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and other parts of the social safety net. House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>, R-Wis ., said recently that he wants Republicans...High-ranking Republicans are hinting that, after their tax overhaul, the party intends to look at cutting spending on welfare, entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and other parts of the social safety net. House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>, R-Wis ., said recently that he wants Republicans...(Jeff Stein) Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz .--who like Corker had been a holdout and has sharply attacked Trump's capabilities as president--voted for the bill. He said he'd received commitments from party leaders and the administration \"to work with me\" to restore protections, dismantled by Trump, for young immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. That seemed short of a pledge to actually revive the safeguards. The Senate bill would drop the highest personal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent. The estate tax levied on a few thousand of the nation's largest inheritances would be narrowed to affect even fewer. Deductions for state and local income taxes, moving expenses and other items would vanish, the standard deduction--used by most Americans--would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples, and the per-child tax credit would grow. The bill would abolish the \"Obamacare\" requirement that most people buy health coverage or face tax penalties. Industry experts say that would weaken the law by easing pressure on healthier people to buy coverage, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the move would push premiums higher and leave 13 million additional people uninsured. Drilling would be allowed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Another provision, knocked out because it violated Senate budget rules, would have explicitly let parents buy tax-advantaged 529 college savings accounts for fetuses, a step they can already take but which anti-abortion forces wanted to inscribe into law. There were also breaks for the wine, beer and spirits industries, Alaska Natives and aircraft management firms.

He is more important than ever.\" The estate has doggedly worked to protect and enhance <mark>Jackson</mark>'s legacy, a task made more challenging this year when two men accused <mark>Jackson</mark> of molesting them as boys in the HBO documentary \"Leaving Neverland,\" sparking new scrutiny of years-old claims that <mark>Jackson</mark> preyed on children. <mark>Jackson</mark> was acquitted of abuse allegations in 2005 and always vehemently denied such allegations, and the estate and his family angrily refuted the men's claims when the documentary was released in March, noting the men had at one time been among <mark>Jackson</mark>'s biggest defenders and one testified on his behalf at his criminal trial. The estate is using the anniversary of <mark>Jackson</mark>'s death to celebrate and accentuate <mark>Jackson</mark>'s vast humanitarian work. It called on fans to honor <mark>Jackson</mark>'s memory by engaging in charitable acts \"whether it's planting a tree, volunteering at a shelter, cleaning up a public space or helping someone who is lost find their way ....This is how we honor <mark>Michael</mark>,\" the statement read. Fans plan to gather at <mark>Jackson</mark>'s last home in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, where the singer received a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol on the afternoon of June 25, 2019 from his doctor. <mark>Jackson</mark> was declared dead at a hospital at age 50. They also plan a vigil at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where <mark>Jackson</mark> was laid to rest two months later. Some planned to gather around <mark>Jackson</mark>'s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One group of fans planned a Hollywood rally Tuesday to declare his innocence of molestation allegations. Co-executors John Branca and John McClain, both major figures in <mark>Jackson</mark>'s career when he was alive, have taken his badly debt-ridden estate and grossed over $1.3 billion through various Jackson-related projects in the past decade, including the film \"This Is It,\" a pair of Cirque du Soleil shows and the sale of <mark>Jackson</mark> assets that included The Beatles catalog. <mark>Jackson</mark> left everything to his mother, his children and charity in his will. The singer's father, Joe, died last year and is buried in the same cemetery as his son, but <mark>Michael</mark>'s 89-year-old mother, five brothers, three sisters and three kids remain alive and well 10 years later. The death of <mark>Jackson</mark> was a massive cultural phenomenon, bringing an outpouring of public affection and revival of his songs and largely erasing the taint that remained after his criminal trial, despite his acquittal. It was one of the earliest instances of the mass mourning on social media that would soon become common, and a massive worldwide audience both on TV and online watched his July 27, 2009 public memorial that included touching tributes from family members including daughter Paris and performances from Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey and Lionel Richie. ___ This story has been corrected to show only one, not both of the \"Leaving Neverland\" accusers testified on <mark>Jackson</mark>'s behalf at his criminal trial. ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https: //twitter.com/andyjamesdalton.

It is still unclear if Austinmer station will become a permanent stop on the South Coast rail timetable. On March 7, Transport for NSW started a three-month trial of an extra stop at Austinmer station for 10 express services--five in the morning and five in the evening. That trial--which came after much pushing from Parliamentary Secretary for the Illawarra <mark>Gareth Ward</mark> - is due to end early next month. The signs are that the trial has been a success--the once-empty car park at Austinmer is now full on weekdays and there are reports of more than 40 people on the platform waiting for a train. In Friday's Mercury Keira MP Ryan Park praised the Austinmer trial but said the public needed to be told what will happen come June. \"The government has monitored car parks and this [trial] has proven to be a great success,\" Mr Park said. \"Opal ticketing and load factors have also been tracked. The Minister is aware that the load factors on our trains are well above capacity during peak periods.\" Anyone who has anything to do with public transport knows that. We want an update on how the trial is progressing and an announcement that the change will remain in place. \"A Transport for NSW spokeswoman declined to release any information it was using to determine the future of the Austinmer stop.\" We are analysing the data and feedback available and look forward to updating the community in due course, \"the spokeswoman said.\" A thorough assessment process will be carried out before any permanent changes are considered. \"Mr Park also suggested Transport for NSW could look at trialling a stop at another station--the Keira MP put forward Woonona. Comments from the Transport for NSW spokeswoman seem to indicate any trials of other stations was unlikely.\" Austinmer station is the best option for an extra stop on selected peak period services considering operational factors such as timetabling feasibility, journey times, and connectivity, \"she said."}, {"articleID": "2011103013_00077668_W", "names": {"Imran Khan": ["Q155164", "Q15987686", "Q1660487", "Q17306146", "Q18351186", "Q18619306", "Q18637473", "Q18637525", "Q18637527", "Q18649030", "Q18687912", "Q18687913", "Q18687915", "Q18687916", "Q21061850", "Q27951129", "Q312781", "Q42560214", "Q43384689", "Q50064378", "Q51161844", "Q57064458", "Q59198528", "Q6008185", "Q6008187"]}, "date": "2011-10-30", "url": "http://brecorder.com/top-news/1-front-top-news/33688-mubarak-trial-postponed-to-december-28.html", "content": "crowds throng <mark>imran khan</mark> rally in lahore democratic forces united to defend democracy: altaf western powers cause an \"earthquake': assad turkey quake toll nears 600 as search efforts wind down commonwealth urges job creation to spur recovery cairo: the trial of ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak which was due to resume on sunday has been postponed following demands for the appointment of a new judge, state-run news agency mena reported. a new hearing has been set for december 28, mena said.\" the cairo criminal court, chaired by judge ahmed refaat, decided to adjourn the trial of former president hosni mubarak, his sons alaa and gamal, businessman hussein salem, former interior minister habib al-adly and six of his assistants to december 28, \"mena said. lawyers for alleged victims of mubarak in his murder trial have petitioned the court demanding that judge refaat be replaced.\" the court has lost its jurisdiction by not administering the sessions in a manner conforming with the course of justice, \"one of the victims' lawyers, abdel moneim abdel maqsud, said on september 24. mena said the trial will resume once a decision has been taken on call to replace refaat, who has defended the court's integrity in previous sessions while lashing out at critics. an appeals court is due to give a verdict on december 26. mubarak, who was forced to quit in february following massive streets protests, has been on trial since august 3 on charges of involvement in the killings of protesters and corruption. he has pleaded not guilty."}, {"articleID": "2017021619_00809053_W", "names": {"Cees Dekker": ["Q330365", "Q42683239"]}, "date": "2017-02-16", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2017-02-cells-bricklaying-scaffolding.html", "content": "Bacteria appear to build a new cell wall working from the outside in with the help of multiple molecular \"bricklayers', in about a quarter of an hour.

Credit: TU Delft It is the most crucial mechanism in life - the division of cells. For 25 years, it has been known that bacteria split into two by forming a Z ring at their centre. They use this to cut themselves into two daughter cells. Using advanced microscopes, researchers from the universities of Harvard, Indiana, Newcastle, and Delft have succeeded in finding out how bacteria do this. The bacteria appear to build a new cell wall working from the outside in with the help of multiple molecular\" bricklayers', in about a quarter of an hour. What was completely unexpected was that the \"bricklayers' move along the inside of the wall under construction by\" treadmilling'; the building of the cell wall is performed from scaffolding that is continuously being moved at the front, while at the rear it is continuously being dismantled. The scientists will be publishing an article on the topic in Science on 17 February. Colours They investigated the process by viewing individual bacteria through advanced microscopes. This involved putting coloured labels on the cell wall material. By changing the colours every time, they were able to see that the bacteria were building the cell walls from the outside in. And by changing the colours of the building material with breaks of just a few seconds, they were also able to see that this is not a gradual process, but one that takes place in a different location each time. The engine that drives all of this is FtsZ, a protein that makes an arched - haped piece of polymer, and which appears to move via a phenomenon known as \"treadmilling', named after the old treadmills from the Middle Ages. Protein as scaffolding\" With treadmilling, you create movement by adding something on the front, while removing something from the rear, \"explains Professor <mark>Cees Dekker</mark> of TU Delft, a co-author on the article.\" Our research shows that a cell also uses this phenomenon for building a cell wall. \"Cell walls are built with the help of a number of collaborating proteins, with FtsZ playing the most important part.\" Our new discovery has solved the 25-year-old puzzle of how FtsZ coordinates cell division. The protein appears to work like a kind of scaffolding, on which the building work takes place. However, it is not rolling scaffolding, but fixed scaffolding that is continuously renovating itself: all the time, the cell is building new scaffolding boards for the work on the cell wall on, let's say, the right-hand side of the FtsZ scaffolding, while breaking up the now-superfluous scaffolding on the left-hand side, at the rear end of the work. This way, the scaffolding shifts along the cell wall. The building machine that produces the cell wall is controlled from the scaffolding, therefore moving neatly in tandem with the slowly moving scaffolding. The cell does this with different sets of scaffolding along the cell wall simultaneously, resulting in the construction of a partition wall in ten or fifteen minutes. Meanwhile, other proteins make sure that the DNA is divided properly between the two halves, for example, or that the membrane is properly closed off, and so on. The division of cells is a complex and fascinating process. \"The video will load shortly Bacteria appear to build a new cell wall working from the outside in with the help of multiple molecular\" bricklayers', in about a quarter of an hour.

The most significant contribution from Delft consisted of the production of nanostructures in which exactly one bacterium fits, lengthwise. \"By placing the nanoboxes upright on the microscope, we were able to see in very sharp focus a cross-section of the cell. This gave us an excellent view of the dynamics of the FtsZ molecules. An important technical contribution.\" explains <mark>Dekker</mark>. Although the study is fundamental in nature, <mark>Dekker</mark> believes that this type of research may be of practical benefit in the future. \"Once we have a thorough understanding of how bacterial cells divide, it could pave the way towards alternative antibiotics. That is still some way off, but if we are able to disrupt bacterial cell division in a targeted manner, we may have new weapons in the future that we can use to fight bacteria that cause disease.\" Special nanocages fitting one cell allow the observation of the forming of the cell wall in bacteria Credit: TU Delft Explore further: Bacterial protein structure could aid development of new antibiotics More information: \"Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division,' Science, 17 February 2017. science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aak9973"}, {"articleID": "2013110601_00065131_W", "names": {"Eddie Murphy": ["Q16095779", "Q43874", "Q5336342"], "Chris Paul": ["Q1077636", "Q46040", "Q56754195"], "Chris Brown": ["Q14951440", "Q155700", "Q240686", "Q2964666", "Q3022478", "Q5105666", "Q5105993", "Q5105995", "Q5105996", "Q5105998", "Q5105999", "Q5106001", "Q5106002", "Q5106003", "Q5106004", "Q5106005", "Q5106007", "Q5106008", "Q5106009", "Q5111994", "Q5112603", "Q51543886", "Q58314139"]}, "date": "2013-11-05", "url": "http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dmx-arrested-for-driving-without-a-license-tags-or-insurance-news.8013.html", "content": "Kanye West Big Boy's Neighborhood Freestyle (Radio Rip) Ty Dolla $ign Fuckin' Tonight Oct 29, 2013 at 2:05 PM <mark>Eddie Murphy</mark> Promise (You Won't Break My Heart) OJ Da Juiceman The Return Of Da Juiceman Oct 31, 2013 at 9:57 PM Roc Marciano The Pimpire Strikes Back 12:06 AM <mark>Chris Paul</mark> Crosses Over & Abuses Jeremy Lin 2 hours ago Victor Oladipo's Dope 360 Dunk Nov 4, 2013 at 10:27 AM Envy: HNHH Exclusive Hotties Photoshoot Aug 2, 2013 at 12:35 PM Drake's Girls: Maliah Michel Vs.
