The country was hamstrung economically since gaining independence from France in the early 19th century, as it was forced to pay reparations to its former European master to compensate former slave owners. The debt was repaid in full by the mid-20th century, but there have been recent calls for France to return the money. In recent years, economic development has been hindered by political instability and devastating natural disasters.

An agreement between the Potters and the Irish FA allows O\u2019Neill to remain in charge of Northern Ireland for the fixtures next spring--their last chance of reaching Euro 2020 after Saturday's 0-0 draw with Holland closed the door on automatic qualification. On Friday, O\u2019Neill refused to say definitively he would still be at the helm of the national team as he adjusts to the demands of the Championship, but speaking after the game he was adamant selecting a squad and scouting the opposition--who will be named in Friday's draw--would not pose a problem. \"It's dead easy,\" he said. \"We're going to turn up on a Sunday and play on a Thursday. I can pick my squad now. I could name it tomorrow. There are not 40 players out there we're not picking .\" I'll be able to (prepare for the opposition). That's not a problem. Our opponents don't play between now and then, they've already played. We're not going to watch individual players play for their clubs, so the work we have on the opponents, we'll have that well in advance. \"O\u2019Neill had previously suggested\" common sense will prevail \"regarding his situation and they would find the\" right resolution for everyone \", comments taken as meaning he may find the demands on his time too much. But that was not the position he took after Saturday's draw--a game Northern Ireland might have won but for a missed penalty from captain <mark>Steven Davis</mark> in the first half .\" In this job, I could watch 40 games or two games and 99 per cent of the time, my squad will be pretty much the same, so people are making a lot out of this situation, which doesn't exist, \"he said .\" To be honest, there's nobody better than me to judge this because I actually do the job and the reality of the situation is to put a coach in with a play-off situation with three days' preparation wouldn't be fair to the players or the association because of what's at stake. \"And it wouldn't be fair to the coach to go and prepare .\" We know our team, we know our best team. We have one or two players to come back in--Conor Washington and <mark>Jordan Jones</mark>--but the squad picks itself other than that. \"Either way, virtually every play-off permutation has Northern Ireland playing away, making Saturday almost certainly O\u2019Neill's Windsor Park farewell with Tuesday's final Group C fixture away to Germany in Frankfurt. He will end his tenure having taken charge of 32 games at the National Stadium, winning 17, drawing six and losing nine, a record he is proud of .\" I think this stadium used to be a place where at times (our own) players and fans dreaded coming, and performances showed that, \"he said .\" Now we have a great atmosphere here, the redevelopment of the stadium has been a big factor in that but what we also have is a group of players who love playing here and a really strong bond between the supporters and the players. \"It's really important we hold on to that going forward, regardless of who's in charge of the team .\" 0 comment", "articleID": "2019111713_00026668_W", "names": {"Jordan Jones": ["Q27830873", "Q48841097", "Q55014126", "Q6276648"], "Steven Davis": ["Q18631669", "Q355807", "Q41805470", "Q57433367"]}}, {"date": "2019-11-18", "url": "https://www.timesleader.com/news/762936/nanticoke-native-palovchak-named-times-leader-circulation-director", "content": "Lori Vandermark. Aimee Dilger | Times Leader - WILKES-BARRE--A newspaper industry industry veteran with a diverse background including advertising and marketing experience has returned to the Times Leader Media Group as the organization's new circulation director. Nanticoke native Lorri Palovchak comes to the paper most recently from the Luzerne County Transportation Authority, where she was manager of public relations. \"We are extremely lucky to be able to add a person of Lorri's caliber to our team,\" Times Leader Media Group Publisher <mark>Mike Murray</mark> said. \"In addition to her general newspaper circulation knowledge, her service and communication expertise will aid us in providing an even better customer experience for our readership,\" <mark>Murray</mark> added. \"We look forward to her joining us .\" Palovchak, who previously worked at the Times Leader as single copy marketing manager in 2003-04, is enthusiastic about her return to the publication. \"I think the Times Leader is an incredible product. We need to make sure we can deliver that incredible product to the customers,\" she said. \"We need to have top-notch customer service and get them the paper when they need it, because we know people depend on it .\" Palovchak is a 1982 Greater Nanticoke Area graduate who spent two decades moving around the country and overseas with her late husband, Frank Vandermark, who served in the U.S. Air Force. She began her newspaper career while the couple were living in Biloxi, Miss. \"I was a military wife and we were looking to make some money, so my husband and I became adult carriers,\" Palovchak recalled. It was at the time when the Knight-Ridder chain, which owned the Biloxi paper (and formerly owned the Times Leader) was switching from youths to adults as newspaper carriers, she explained. \"My husband was in computers, so we literally started computer billing before anyone else did and we turned our route into a business,\" Palovchak said. \"We got so good at it they started giving us routes that went down. We would fix it up and build it up and give it back to them .\" That led to a promotion. \"I was the first carrier ever hired as a district manager,\" Palovchak said. \"I worked in home delivery and I really enjoyed it. I had a lot of success, and I liked building routes and building carriers .\" Palovchak also participated in what that paper's editor called \"total newspaper training,\" a program that allowed leaders in each department to learn how every other department operated. It would lead a path to a new career in the next town. \"I really enjoyed my time in advertising. So when we left Biloxi and went to Colorado Springs, I tried my hand at advertising,\" she said. For the next five-a-half years she sold advertising to the military market for a military newspaper there. Next was Belleville, Ill., and another Knight-Ridder paper where Palovchak worked as a single copy manager. From there the family moved to Germany, \"where there weren't a lot of newspaper openings,\" she said, but Palovchak did operate a gas station on a NATO base. Stateside once again, it was back to the couple's native Northeastern Pennsylvania, and a year at the Times Leader. Palovchak worked for a family business for a time, and then at West Side Career & Technology Center as their career resource recruiter. She later became a certified trainer for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, working in emergency management for such events as flood recovery and the 2015 Papal visit. In that year she joined LCTA, initially as a marketing coordinator. But it also was a year marked by deep personal loss. \"My late husband was one of the 22 veterans a day who take their lives,\" Palovchak said. She is active in the veterans community, and works on suicide awareness with veterans groups. \"It's very dear to my heart,\" Palovchak said. Last year she married David Palovchak, and the couple live in Swoyersville. \"We are fully committed to NEPA,\" said the mother of two and grandmother of three. \"This is home .\" For that reason, Palovchak is focused on how to meet the needs of existing and future customers of the hometown newspaper. \"I'm pretty technical. I get news on social media, I get news on the Internet, but I also need to have a newspaper in my hands,\" Palovchak said. \"My vision is to make sure that we continue to get the product in front of current subscribers but also new subscribers, make sure Millennials know what it's like to have a newspaper in their hands and also promote the community service that we provide,\" she added. \"We need to make sure that our customers know that we care .\" Lori Vandermark.

After all the talk about the new format and the influence of Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, who persuaded the International Tennis Federation to partner with him on the World Cup-style event, the first three ties were played at the Caja Magica. Most of the scepticism has been about whether fans would travel to watch their countries at a neutral venue and whether the atmosphere could come anywhere close to matching the traditional home-and-away format. Are you sure there are just 15?????????? pic.twitter.com/SouZ8FnBG7--Gerard Piqu\u00e9 (@ 3gerardpique) November 18, 2019 The initial results were largely positive. The clash between Russia and Croatia on the largest court, which seats more than 12,000 spectators, felt a little flat but the stands were around half full and the Croatia fans, in particular, were noisy. The tie on the second court, pitting Canada against Italy, was lively throughout, as was Belgium's clash with Colombia, despite a significant number of empty seats. A tweet from Belgium's former French Open semi-finalist Filip Dewulf, who is now a journalist, about the sparse crowd was met with a pithy response from Pique. French player Alize Cornet then bit back at the defender, saying: \"Dear Gerard, I can see that you've never been to a REAL Davis Cup! And that's not it .\" Day 1. @ DavisCupFinals pic.twitter.com/OYuDgimw6o--Gerard Piqu\u00e9 (@ 3gerardpique) November 18, 2019 The Madrid Open, which has long hosted a tour event at the same site in the spring, weighed in with a picture of full stands accompanied by the message: \"NOTHING like this!\" It was subsequently deleted. It is understandable that Pique is touchy about criticism, particularly given the negativity with which his involvement has been met by many in tennis, but he would be better off staying out of such spats and hoping his product does the talking. The Spaniard has spoken of wanting this week to be a show, and it began with a somewhat bizarre opening ceremony an hour and a half before the matches, for which the stands were understandably largely empty. Rather less technological thought had gone into providing live scores on the tournament's app and website, although they did eventually appear. Canada's Vasek Pospisil produced the upset of the day against Fabio Fognini (Bernat Armangue/AP) On court, Canada claimed top honours with an impressive victory over Italy. Despite being without their number two Felix Auger-Aliassime, who has been sidelined by injury, 150th-ranked Vasek Pospisil upset world number 12 Fabio Fognini 7-6 (5) 7-5 before <mark>Denis Shapovalov</mark> edged a very tight encounter against eighth-ranked Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (5) 6-7 (3) 7-6 (5). Defending champions Croatia were severely weakened by the withdrawal of their number one Marin Cilic through injury and were beaten 3-0 by Spain. Borna Gojo, making his debut, lost 6-3 6-3 to Andrey Rublev and Borna Coric's losing run continued with a 6-7 (4) 6-4 6-4 loss to Karen Khachanov.

With hosts Spain the other team in their group and only two of the eight runners-up going through to the quarter-finals, all the teams are well aware that every rubber, set and even game could be vital. Belgium have punched well above their weight in recent years and they beat Colombia 2-1, with singles victories for Steve Darcis and David Goffin before world number one doubles team Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah got the South Americans on the board. Tuesday sees Spain contest a rare sold-out tie against Russia, while France, the USA and Australia also begin their campaigns. 0 comment", "articleID": "2019111823_00026745_W", "names": {"Denis Shapovalov": ["Q20979382", "Q4520285"]}}]
