[{"date": "2014-12-11", "url": "http://www.noise11.com/news/stax-to-release-box-set-of-singles-20141211", "content": "Concord Music Group and Stax Records have announced the digital release and physical reissue of two comprehensive box set titles: The Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 2: 1968-1971 and The Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 3: 1972-1975. Originally released in 1993 and 1994, respectively, these two compilations will be re-released back into the physical market in compact and sleek new packaging. Each set includes full-color booklets with in-depth essays by Stax historian and compilations co-producer <mark>Rob Bowman</mark>. The volumes feature stalwart Stax R & B artists including Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers, Rufus <mark>Thomas</mark>, Johnnie Taylor, <mark>Carla Thomas</mark>, the Bar-Kays and <mark>William Bell</mark>, as well as bluesmen Little Milton, <mark>Albert King</mark> and Little Sonny, and \"second generation\" Stax hitmakers like Jean Knight, the Soul Children, <mark>Kim Weston</mark>, the Temprees, and Mel & Tim. Many of the tracks included in these collections will be made available digitally for the very first time. The story of the great Memphis soul label Stax/Volt can be divided into two distinct eras: the period from 1959 through the beginning of 1968, when the company was distributed by Atlantic and was developing its influential sound and image (chronicled in acclaimed 9-CD box set The Complete Stax/Volt Singles 1959-1968, released by Atlantic in 1991); and the post-Atlantic years, from May 1968 through the end of 1975, when Stax/Volt began its transition from a small, down-home enterprise to a corporate soul powerhouse. In Stax's early years as an independent label, founders <mark>Jim Stewart</mark> and Estelle Axton struggled with the loss of its back catalog to Atlantic/Warner Brothers Records and the loss of the label's most lucrative artist, Otis Redding, who tragically died in a plane crash months before. In need of funding and new stars, Axton and <mark>Stewart</mark> sold the label to Gulf + Western, bringing on promotion head Al Bell (who would soon become an equal partner and major figurehead of the label). In his Vol. 2 essay, <mark>Rob Bowman</mark> recalls, \"As the sun arose in Memphis on May 6, 1968 [the day Stax officially became independent of Atlantic], Stax had been essentially gutted. For all intents and purposes it was a new record company poised to issue its first few records .\" Comprised of nine CDs, Vol. 2 focuses on this period, 1968 through 1971, when Stax/Volt was forging ahead as its own entity. The 216-song collection includes all of the singles issued by the label during this time period, and features some of the biggest and best-loved hits of the day, including Isaac Hayes' Theme From Shaft, The Staple Singers' Respect Yourself and Johnnie Taylor's Who's Making Love, as well as a number of little-known gems by both major and less-familiar artists. By the end of 1971, <mark>Bowman</mark> notes, \"Al Bell's dream of [Stax/Volt] becoming a diversified full-line record company was several steps further along the line to being reality. The label now recorded a wealth of different styles and flavors of black popular music, ranging from the jazz and easy-listening proclivities of Isaac Hayes to the blues of Little Milton to the '70s disco-infused vocal style of the Dramatics to the gutsy soul of the Staple Singers .\" Indeed, the early 1970s found Stax/Volt a much bigger entity than ever thought possible during its initial split from Atlantic, with Isaac Hayes as its breakout star. Spurred by the success of Hayes' GRAMMY Award-Winning Shaft soundtrack in early 1972, the label was casting its net across a wide cross section of the entertainment industry, entering into new territory with soundtracks, comedy records, and even investing in a Broadway play. The Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 3: 1972-1975, coming Spring 2015, covers this era of success and excess, when Stax's stars were shining bright, but the label was on the verge of its dramatic denouement. The 10-disc box set contains all 213 soul singles issued by Stax/Volt during this time, including such hits as <mark>Shirley Brown</mark>'s Woman to Woman and the Staple Singers' I'll Take You There. In 1976, faced with involuntary bankruptcy and an unsuccessful distribution deal with CBS Records, Stax was forced to close its doors. In his liner notes for Vol. 3, compilation co-producer Bill Belmont writes, \"Stax's difficult and inglorious end in no way diminishes its vital contributions to rhythm and blues and soul. Today, the music of Stax maintains a strong and steady presence, heard continually in cover versions by major artists, in movies and on television. Simply put, the Memphis Sound lives .\" And indeed it does. With a revival of the label in recent years, through Fantasy Records, the 2003 opening of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, Tenn., as well as several developing theatrical performances around the label, the music of Stax will continue to influence generations of musicians and fans alike .----------------------------------------------Never miss a story!

The latest economic forecasts from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) indicate that the UK's overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate should improve by 3 per cent this year. In response to weakening economic signals from abroad and lower-than-expected household consumption growth, this is slightly down on the group's earlier prediction of 3.2 per cent. However, despite the slight downgrade, the business group said further growth is expected to be seen in the building industry between now and 2016. It said the output of the construction sector should grow by 4.9 per cent in 2014, in full-year terms. Looking further ahead, the body added that construction output growth rates of 1.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent should also be witnessed respectively in 2015 and in the following year. Employers in the construction trade continue to offer apprenticeship schemes, in order to plug skill gaps and provide work opportunities to young people. These efforts appear to be having a positive impact, with the BCC suggesting that the unemployment total among 16 to 24 year-olds should drop from 737,000 in the third quarter of this year, to 533,000 in the same period of 2017. The UK's wider unemployment figure should dip from 1.959 million to 1.839 million by the third quarter of next year, meanwhile, the group suggested. Despite the downgrade in the headline GDP forecast, BCC director general <mark>John Longworth</mark> said the UK should remain one of the world's quickest-growing developed economies this year. He added: \"This is a great achievement, and businesses up and down the country should be congratulated for their hard work and resolve to drive the recovery in the face of challenges and uncertainty both at home and abroad .\" As Britain continues to recover from the effects of the recession, the BCC said businesses should see further economic growth in both 2015 and 2016. It said the country's GDP reading is likely to improve by 2.6 per cent next year and by another 2.4 per cent in 2016. Among its other predictions, the trade body said business investment levels should stay strong. It said these investments should go up by 7.5 per cent in 2014 alone.

Nick Matthews on <mark>Brown</mark>'s legacy As <mark>Gordon Brown</mark> disappears into the dustbin of history as the man who saved the Union, it is appropriate to take a look at his significance. There is no doubt that he was both the architect and builder of new Labour's economic policy which has been so difficult for Ed Miliband to shake off. This is probably because he has persisted in dragging the dead weight of Ed Balls around with him. Balls not only represents the <mark>Brown</mark> legacy but offers little hope that Labour has learned anything from those years. My own view is that history will be much kinder to <mark>Brown</mark> the prime minister than to <mark>Brown</mark> the chancellor. This is probably the exact opposite of the popular perception. <mark>Brown</mark> the prime minister may have offered up a Freudian slip in the Commons when he said he had \"saved the world\" but to a large extent he had. When the banks teetered on the edge of collapse in 2008 he bailed them out and put up taxes. <mark>Brown</mark>'s bank nationalisation and bailout was the right thing to do. The alternative would have been catastrophic. However at a greater distance one can see that in effect the banks nationalised the government and socialised their losses. Did <mark>Brown</mark> extract enough from the state's newfound role as the owner or part owner of these banks? The answer is no. That bargain could only have been struck at the moment of disaster when - for a moment - the power moved to the state. But <mark>Brown</mark> asked for little or nothing for underwriting the banks to the tune of \u00a3 1,162 billion. On the plus side, <mark>Brown</mark>'s Keynesian efforts to counteract the crisis meant the economy was returning to growth - before <mark>George Osborne</mark> put the brakes on with his first emergency budget and derailed the whole process, costing billions in lost output. However that is only a small part of <mark>Brown</mark>'s record. As chancellor he was a slavish supporter of Alan Greenspan who for 18 years was boss of the US Federal Reserve. The same Greenspan who finally admitted when the banks were collapsing that he had found a flaw in the theory of \"perfect markets\" - a flaw that had been obvious to most of us for years. Having pursued policies of deregulation and liberalisation, Greenspan had now found \"he made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms .\" In pursuing the same policies and making London a safe haven for rogue global capital, <mark>Brown</mark> turned the City in to the world's largest tax haven. One of his daftest ideas and one the Establishment continues to praise him for was making the Bank of England \"independent .\" One of the greatest triumphs of the post-war Labour government was the nationalisation of the Bank of England. The idea that the policies pursued by the bank can somehow be depoliticised is fatuous. At this level economics is politics. What's more, an independent bank for years kept UK interest rates higher than those in mainland Europe, doing untold damage to Britain's manufacturing sector. <mark>Brown</mark> managed to destroy one-and-a-half million manufacturing jobs in the process. As well as liberating the City and the financial services sector to do their worst, his next crime was the way he structured the welfare state to create a set of subsidies to the private sector. His complex web of in-work benefits kept workers trapped on low pay and subsidised bad employers. Simultaneously housing benefit grew as private-sector landlords had a field day ratcheting up rents to milk the subsidy. What's more, because ordinary people received little benefit from his largesse they did not thank him at the ballot box for this spending. There are other examples, including the way that private-sector provision of care for children and the elderly has fallen in quality and risen in cost. A week does not go by without some scandal in these private services. He was truly naive in thinking ownership did not matter and you could use regulated markets to achieve better services for the public. Clearly Blair and <mark>Brown</mark> both had a malign influence in the Labour Party. <mark>Brown</mark> was ruthless in rooting out any opposition to his policies and spent an inordinate amount of time jousting with Blair in placing his cronies in safe parliamentary constituencies. It is clear now that the golden years of <mark>Brown</mark>'s chancellorship can be seen as being funded by fool's gold.

Health bosses from both the Western Sussex Hospital Trust and Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which awarded Bupa CSH Ltd a \u00a3 235m musculoskeletal (MSK) contract, were before West Sussex County Council's Health and Social Care committee on Friday December 5. An independent impact assessment into the decision was jointly commissioned by the Trust and CCG after Western bosses went public with fears that its accident and emergency units at Chichester's St Richard's Hospital and Worthing Hospital could suffer as a result of the deal. Both are used by South Downs residents. One question asked by GP and committee vice chairman Dr <mark>James Walsh</mark> was why private procurement was chosen over public bidders. Marie Dodd, the CCG's chief operations officer, said legal advice made it clear there was \"no other option' but to offer the services out to tender. She said:\" The CCG (sought legal guidance) and reluctantly had to accept the advice that procurement was going to be the best vehicle, and the required vehicle for us to use in those circumstances. \"Dr Katie Armstrong, chief officer at the CCG, said a summary of the assessment would be made public once both bodies had studied it in full. The results will be shared with committee members ahead of HASC's next meeting on January 21, 2015. Committee's chairman, <mark>Margaret Evans</mark>, said:\" We will look very closely at the impact assessment's results as the MSK contract has been a matter of significant concern to the committee and to the public. * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.
