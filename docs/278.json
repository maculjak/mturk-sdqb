Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that while he hopes it doesn't come to it, the government could shut down certain sections of the country hit hard by the coronavirus. Speaking during an interview on\" Fox News Sunday, \"Fauci said that\" anything is possible \"when asked if measures like those currently being imposed in Italy could be enacted in the U.S. to help prevent the continued spread of the coronavirus .\" I don't think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out, \"Fauci said .\" But if we continue to get cases like this, particularly at the community level, there will be what we call \"mitigation,' where we have to essentially do social distancing, keep people out of crowded places, take a look at seriousness, do you really need to travel, and I think it's particularly important among the most vulnerable .\" He added: \"You know, you don't want to alarm people, but given the spread we've seen, you know, anything's possible. And that's the reason why we've got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak .\" CORONAVIRUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW Fauci's comments shortly after Italian Minister <mark>Giuseppe Conte</mark> signed a decree restricting the movements of about a quarter of the country's population in a bid to limit contagions at the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. Video \"For Lombardy and for the other northern provinces that I have listed there will be a ban for everybody to move in and out of these territories and also within the same territory,\" <mark>Conte</mark> said. \"Exceptions will be allowed only for proven professional needs, exceptional cases and health issues .\" Around the world, more and more countries were bracing for a big increase in virus cases. Western countries have been increasingly imitating China--where the virus first emerged late last year, and which has suffered the vast majority of infections--by imposing travel controls and shutting down public events. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE While the global death toll has risen past 3,400, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; 6,000 in the Mideast; about 450 in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa. Video While many scientists say the world is clearly in the grips of a pandemic--a serious global outbreak--the World Health Organization isn't calling it that yet, saying the word might spook the world further. The virus is still much less widespread than annual flu epidemics, which cause up to 5 million severe cases around the world and up to 650,000 deaths annually, according to the WHO. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions to \"stay home as much as possible\" and avoid crowds. Most people who get the virus have mild cases, though the elderly face greater risks. Among the many new cases in Europe on Saturday was a doctor in Slovenia who was in contact with more than 100 people in a nursing home after a ski trip to neighboring Italy.

previously struggling indians. with <mark>carrasco</mark> offering up his third straight dominant start saturday night, cleveland rolled to a 5-1 victory at progressive field, securing the series against interleague rival pittsburgh by winning for the fourth time in six games. the indians' offense is beginning to show signs of life, but it was <mark>carrasco</mark> that stole the show, needing little support to win for the third straight time. the right-hander allowed just a run on four hits over 6 1/3 innings, no-hitting the pirates while allowing just one baserunner over the first five innings. \"<mark>carrasco</mark> continues to throw the ball very well,\" said manager manny acta, whose team reassumed control of the central division with a one-game lead over detroit in the standings. \"he looks very comfortable out there .\" he's in a very good groove right now. hopefully he can continue to do that. he looks real good right now. he looks like he can throw any pitch in any count. \"locating his fastball to near perfection while mixing in a steady diet of breaking pitches, <mark>carrasco</mark> stymied pirates hitters for the majority of his outing. he struck out four and walked one, extending his scoreless innings streak to 21 1/3 innings before allowing his only run in the seventh .\" i had command of everything tonight, \"<mark>carrasco</mark> said .\" my slider was very good today. \"the most important thing is throwing deep into the game and that's what i've done the last three games .\" <mark>carrasco</mark> has done plenty over that span, winning three times, while posting a minuscule 0.41 era. he is 6-1 since may 11, and is tied for eighth in the american league with seven wins on the season to go along with a 3.87 era. \"he's been great,\" catcher lou marson said. \"he's locating his heater and pitching off his fastball, which is what he needs to do .\" marson has been behind the plate for the majority of <mark>carrasco</mark>'s starts, coming up with him in the phillies organization in 2004. he is comfortable with his former minor league catcher behind the dish. \"he reads my mind,\" <mark>carrasco</mark> said of marson. \"he knows exactly what i want to throw .\" <mark>carrasco</mark> allowed his first hit to lead off the sixth on a liner to second from michael mckenry that could have been handled by orlando cabrera. cabrera leapt and had the ball in his glove before it popped out and he couldn't scoop it in time to throw to first. acta thought cabrera was going to catch the ball. \"of course,\" he said. \"i was thinking no-hitter like everyone else .\" cabrera atoned himself by hitting a solo home run off pirates starter paul maholm to put the indians in front 3-0 in the sixth, his first homer since april 16. the indians scored single runs in each of the first two innings, then added two more after the cabrera homer to put the game away in the seventh. a leadoff triple from grady sizemore that just missed carrying the wall in center sparked the inning. sizemore rode home on a sacrifice fly from michael brantley and after singling and stealing second, asdrubal cabrera scored on a two-out base hit from shin-soo choo. \"we executed very well with runners in scoring position,\" said acta, whose team has struggled mightily in the department as of late. \"we have to continue pushing. it's a homestand we want to play well in .\" sizemore, who entered the night riding an 0-for-10 skid, went 2-for-3 with an rbi, two runs, a double and a triple."}, {"articleID": "2010100702_00099137_W", "names": {"John

republicans are frequently criticized for racial insensitivity, it's important to spotlight their progress in this area. case in point - did you know that california gubernatorial candidate meg whitman created a job for a young illegal immigrant named nicky diaz santillan? whitman employed santillan as a housekeeper for nine years, and i think we can all agree no racist would let a mexican near their personal belongings like that. however, whitman's in a pickle because she didn't know santillan was illegal (so whitman claims, anyway). once she found out, she had no choice but to terminate santillan, because that's what law-abiding employers do. to say santillan didn't take it well would be a massive understatement - she hired professional douchebag lawyer gloria allred to sue whitman. nothing illustrates the phrase \"no good deed goes unpunished\" like this nasty santillan business. custom requires me to point out meg whitman is a billionaire. does anyone not know she's a billionaire? in case you were unaware, meg whitman is supposedly, according to some estimates, worth upwards of one billion dollars. forbes lists her net worth at $1.3 billion. she's also spent tens of millions of her own fortune on her campaign, if that means anything to you. personally, i'm always in favor of an individual's right to spend their hard-earned money on frivolous pursuits. billionaire. so as you can imagine, being rich means you need a little help with the chores. santillan was whitman's domestic for almost a decade, and everything was in order until one fateful day. santillan confessed to whitman she was an illegal immigrant, and had provided false documentation of citizenship when applying for work. depending on whom you believe, santillan came clean out of loyalty to whitman, to warn her that this immigration issue could hurt the campaign. when faced with an admission of fraud, whitman terminated santillan's employment. apparently santillan wasn't expecting that reaction, and has retaliated with the legal equivalent of shock and awe: an attorney for nicky diaz santillan, the former housekeeper of california republican gubernatorial candidate meg whitman, claimed today that whitman was aware of santillan's status as an illegal immigrant and fired the housekeeper when she asked for help. the attorney, gloria allred, said she was filing a claim for lost wages that are due to santillan. the two women appeared at a press conference where santillan tearfully discussed the allegations. if i had to choose between being sued by gloria allred or being waterboarded? i actually think my chances of surviving waterboarding without lasting damage would be pretty good. seriously. wouldn't you? whether or not whitman mistreated santillan on occasion is beside the point now. hiring gloria allred is a decision that forfeits any reasonable benefit of doubt. in the parlance of the 2006 israel-lebanon war, deploying gloria allred is a disproportionate response. it's a morally repugnant act, comparable to suicide-bombing. outside of <mark>john edwards</mark>, there is no personification of pernicious lawyer-ism as thoroughly detestable as gloria allred. she barely seems human. allred's shameless attention-whoring is matched only by her transparent phoniness. this whole santillan case is quite obviously meant to harm whitman's campaign. it's certainly not for santillan's benefit. allred produced a letter from the social security administration that she says proves whitman knew santillan was undocumented in 2003. you can read the letter here (pdf), but it doesn't quite convey allred's undeserved self-satisfaction like this picture: the letter indicates there was a problem with santillan's social security number, which supposedly proves whitman is lying about not knowing santillan's immigration status. look, you can see whitman's husband's handwriting right there! it says, \"nicky please look into this. thanks .\" what a bastard! despite the flowery build up, it's not exactly evidence of anything other than whitman's husband's good manners. the third paragraph of the letter says, \"this letter does not imply that you or your employee intentionally provided incorrect information about the employee's name or ssn .\" it also says the letter is not a basis for terminating an employee, and that employers may face legal consequences if they do. all an employer can do is let their employee know about the letter and ask them to look into it. thanks. in her haste to embarrass whitman, it's very likely allred is harming her client. by holding a press conference, she's announced to the world her client is an illegal alien and a fraud. that's a peculiar way of advocating the client's best interests. in view of santillan's admitted dishonesty, any chance of winning a lawsuit for mistreatment is slim. by gratuitously manipulating her emotionally vulnerable client, allred has reached new depths of ignominy in a profession that is already famous for its depravity. for a more entertaining version of that same argument, here's greta van sustern ripping allred apart while she sits there wallowing in false indignation. but the ultimate responsibility is with santillan. if she truly felt exploited or treated unfairly by whitman, she could have sought employment elsewhere. nine years is a long time to keep a job you don't like. reports indicate santillan earned the equivalent of $47,000 annually when she worked for whitman, which suggests she has a valuable skill set. even when you account for california's high cost of living, $47,000 is better than median income. santillan could have gotten another job for less pay and still made a comfortable living. it's not as if she didn't have options. and post under your registered name. if not, you can post as a guest or i would have sex with gloria allred...posted by: fat ass tna troll (guest) on october 06, 2010 at 09:25 pm that's

So in March 2014, Shyp launched to make the process as easy as taking a picture of what you want to mail, pressing a single button to summon a delivery person, and having your package shipped. On Tuesday, Shyp announced that it had raised a $50 million Series B round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, with participation from previous investors including Homebrew and Sherpa Ventures, and angel investors like <mark>Kevin Rose</mark> and Rent The Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman, bringing the startup's total funding to date to $62.2 million. In addition, the company says, Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr will join Shyp's board of directors. The company also announced the launch of a beta program in Los Angeles, in addition to the three cities where it currently operates: New York, Miami, and San Francisco. The new funding will allow Shyp to continue to expand throughout the US, to grow its team, and to develop new features. (In March, Shyp rolled out a feature for returns .) Since its last round of funding in July 2014, the company says it's seeing 20 percent month-over-month customer growth, has \"tens of thousands\" of customers, and its number of shipments has increased by nearly 500%. \"This is a momentous day for Shyp. We couldn't have hoped for a better partner to counsel us as we creatively solve extremely complex problems than John Doerr and the team at Kleiner Perkins,\" Shyp's CEO <mark>Kevin</mark> Gibbon said in a statement. In addition to its ease of use, Shyp provides transparency about where your package is along the way, and lets you know when it reaches its intended recipient. Shyp's convenience costs more than a trip to the post office would: you'll be paying $5 per package, plus the cost of shipping. And unlike Postmates, the on-demand courier service, Shyp can send packages globally, like UPS or FedEx.
