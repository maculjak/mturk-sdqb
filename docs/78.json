august 29, 2010 nashville, tenn.--vince young was sacked four times in two quarters, all pro <mark>chris johnson</mark> found himself stymied and left tackle <mark>michael roos</mark> banged his right knee in an ugly preseason loss. at least the tennessee titans can console themselves with how well the defense played. a unit so woeful in 2009 giving up an average of 25.1 points per game was the only bright spot in the titans' 15-7 loss at carolina on saturday night. top draft pick <mark>derrick morgan</mark> finally made his nfl debut, and the titans kept a carolina squad looking for its first touchdown this preseason out of the end zone despite the panthers' first team playing three quarters. \"defensively, we kept things basic and played hard and played well,\" coach <mark>jeff fisher</mark> said sunday. \"we tackled well, we rushed well, we covered well, so i thought we had a pretty good day defensively against an offense that was trying to score points .\" the titans (1-2) were playing their second game in six days, not counting a joint practice with arizona midweek. they also played without starting tackle <mark>tony brown</mark>, who remains on the physically unable to perform list, or cornerback cortland finnegan, who has missed the first three preseason games because of a strained groin. tennessee limited carolina to 241 yards through three quarters and 51 yards rushing. deangelo williams had a meager 13 yards on nine carries. carolina had to settle for two field goals, the last in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter with the titans already having subbed into their third-team defensive players. <mark>morgan</mark> was the highlight, playing 15 snaps after having missed all but the final day of training camp because of a strained calf. the 16th pick out of georgia tech strung together four straight plays in which he barely missed his first sack, enough in his debut to excite defensive line coach jim washburn. \"needless to say, he was quite impressive with his first four considering the fact that this was the first time he had full pads on since last january against iowa,\" <mark>fisher</mark> said. \"i thought his first outing was pretty impressive, if you take into consideration he is rushing against a starting nfl tackle as well .\" <mark>morgan</mark> got out on the field during the titans' opening defensive series, and <mark>fisher</mark> said they saw the strength, power and good hands that convinced the team to draft him. \"he had two hits on the quarterback and had an assist and a tackle for loss in the first four plays and was equally as effective in the other 11,\" <mark>fisher</mark> said. the titans also have yet to decide who starts opposite finnegan. jason mccourty and rookie alterraun verner are in a tight battle, and <mark>fisher</mark> isn't giving any hints. \"nothing says i can't play them both in the regular season,\" the coach said. <mark>fisher</mark> expects <mark>brown</mark> back this thursday night when the titans host the defending super bowl champion new orleans saints (2-1) to wrap up the preseason. it's another short week with little time to work on an offense that looked very inept in carolina. tennessee managed only 50 yards in the first half on 25 plays. <mark>johnson</mark> ran eight times for only 10 yards. young was 6 of 9 for 48 yards. but the titans got only four first downs, just as many times as the panthers sacked young, as they went through their first preseason game without scoring at least one touchdown. young, sacked all of nine times in his 12 appearances in 2009, already has been sacked five times this preseason. the panthers took him down four times saturday night, keeping offensive line coach mike munchak busy on the sideline reacting to fronts they hadn't practiced against. <mark>fisher</mark> insisted he wasn't concerned about his offense, especially not after seeing all the panthers did defensively on tape. \"we kept things basic and simple, and we just wanted to let players play. we didn't scheme or come into the game with much of a game plan,\" he said. notes: <mark>fisher</mark> said <mark>roos</mark> will not need any examinations on his knee. he has started 80 straight games in the regular season, third among all tackles ....rookie damian williams dislocated his right shoulder when he was hit and fumbled on a punt return. but he returned and played wide receiver in the second half. the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. photos of

ninth ward broke, flooding the city and devastating lives. time looks back at the stories that were told there on a humid morning in may, mitch landrieu was sworn in as the 61st mayor of new orleans. in his inaugural address, landrieu, 50, sounded very much like a southern black baptist preacher (he is white and catholic) as he told his city's far-flung post-hurricane katrina diaspora, \"it is time for you to come home .\" the blogs and press made much of the fact that landrieu is the first white mayor elected in more than three decades in new orleans, which remains a majority-black city. the key question remains, can mitch landrieu put new orleans into recovery mode? by many measures, landrieu's new orleans is remarkably different from the city that, five years ago this week, was devastated by hurricane katrina. the city is wealthier, younger and whiter. its population has rebounded to an estimated 355,000, nearly 80% of its pre-katrina level. optimism is pervasive - only partly because the new orleans saints managed to reach the super bowl for the first time in its 43-year history and win. the city has largely evaded the recession and is the epicenter of some of the most audacious urban-renewal projects in america. exhibit a: the robust network of charter and public schools that actually expects students to succeed - and has the tools to help them do so. \"we're building from the ground up and attempting to set the standard for true community renewal in america,\" landrieu told the national press club last week. a trim man with close-cropped hair, landrieu is the scion of a political dynasty. his sister mary is louisiana's senior u.s. senator. his father maurice \"moon\" landrieu, a liberal democrat, was mayor of new orleans from 1970 to 1978 and is widely credited with opening political and business opportunities for the city's black population. that helped lead to a three-decade succession of black mayors, which began with ernest \"dutch\" morial and ended when mitch landrieu succeeded the term-limited ray nagin in may. landrieu had tried to become mayor twice before. in 1994, he ran against morial's son but finished a very distant third. in 2006, he challenged nagin, who defeated him 52% to 48%. this time, landrieu would benefit from two things: first, nagin's disastrous second term. second, the accolades he received in the post-katrina period. as lieutenant governor, landrieu distanced himself from the bumbling performance of governor kathleen babineaux blanco, partly by demanding that the boards that manage the levees surrounding new orleans be dismantled. beyond that, while he never took a memorably hard stance on any controversial issue, he cultivated a reputation as a consensus builder. the february 2010 election was, essentially, a referendum on nagin's regime. \"there was buyer's remorse,\" says political consultant silas lee. landrieu presented himself as a reformer, familiar with obama's washington, able to unite a city that nagin, in his rule-by-bullhorn way, had publicly declared forever \"chocolate,\" a \"majority african-american city...the way god wants it to be .\" indeed, in the days before february's election, the key question about landrieu, says <mark>peter burns</mark>, a loyola university political-science professor and author of electoral politics is not enough: racial and ethnic minorities and urban politics, was, \"can a white man win in new orleans?\" landrieu won decisively, with 66% of the vote. he also captured an estimated 62% of votes cast by african americans. that's attributable to two key factors: first, black voters want the same things - like credible leadership - as the general population. second, black voters, particularly of a certain generation, have a deep sense of loyalty to the landrieu family. \"people have high expectations for mitch,\" <mark>burns</mark> says, \"and he needs to be careful about that .\" to understand landrieu's new orleans, you must remember that, in many ways, it is a tale of two recoveries. the wealthier and whiter lakeview section has largely rebounded. but the lower ninth ward - \"the poster child of katrina,\" as neighborhood activist <mark>linda jackson</mark> describes it - looks much as it did just a few months after the water receded. homes that had been washed onto the street have been demolished. in their place are lots with grass taller than men, giving some blocks an odd, rural vibe. money that had been pledged to help restore the neighborhood hasn't trickled down. crime remains the most vexing problem facing new orleans, according to a recent survey by the kaiser family foundation. it certainly doesn't help that in the same survey only about 13% of respondents said they trust the police to do what's right \"almost always .\" landrieu has asked the u.s. justice department to investigate new orleans' long-troubled police department. the move was widely interpreted as preemptive: federal authorities probably would have launched a probe, especially after several police officers were charged with fatally shooting four men in a chaotic post-katrina incident known as the danziger bridge case. u.s. attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> went to new orleans in july and made clear that his department \"will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who have sworn to protect the public .\" in the meantime, the new mayor has come in for criticism over some of his appointments. barely a week into his term, the doctor that landrieu appointed as new orleans' acting health director abruptly resigned amid published reports that she allegedly continued to see patients despite having been suspended by louisiana's board of medical examiners. there were complaints when landrieu named his sister-in-law, an attorney, the city's chief of economic development. louisiana's antinepotism rules, however, do not bar the hiring or appointment of a spouse's siblings. one key area landrieu must continue to deal with is education. new orleans, post-katrina, has an often confusing network of charter and public schools that has boosted student performance. it also worked, in part, because katrina removed much of the resistance that is proving to be a barrier to academic innovation in places like detroit. but at some point, there will be a clamor for the mayor to articulate a clear and unified vision for education. and then there's the perpetually vexing matter of race. consider this: new orleans once had a vibrant black political class. now it has a white mayor, who has installed a white police chief, and an elected white district attorney. \"that's like the holy trinity of power in this town,\" says <mark>burns</mark>, the loyola professor. the city council is majority white. new orleans' congressman, serving louisiana's second district, is a vietnamese american. silas lee, a political analyst, struggles to acknowledge the challenges. \"let me be honest,\" says lee, who is african american. \"there's a leadership deficit .\" that's partly attributable to the post-katrina demographic shift (when the percentage of blacks in the city fell from 67% to 59%). but it's also due to the failure of an older generation of blacks to cultivate credible successors. landrieu must deal with that growing sense of disempowerment.", "articleID": "2010083018_00079231_W", "names":
