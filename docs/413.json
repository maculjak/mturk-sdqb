The Bears hope that Inman and Trubisky can give opposing defenses some concerns outside of the running game. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Chicago Bears acquired Dontrelle Inman from the Los Angeles Chargers on Wednesday. The Bears agreed to send a conditional draft pick to the Chargers. That pick will likely be a seventh-round selection in the 2018 NFL draft. Dontrelle Inman, a 28-year-old veteran immediately becomes the Bears most established wide receiver on the roster. At 6-foot-3, he has the size to win jump ball passes. Inman became expendable for the Chargers, who have Pro Bowler Keenan Allen, Tyrell Williams, and a healthy <mark>Mike Williams</mark>. The L.A. Chargers want to take a long look at rookie <mark>Mike Williams</mark>. The former Clemson star was taken No. 7 by the Chargers in last April's NFL draft. <mark>Williams</mark>' presence left Dontrelle Inman inactive in Week 7. It left open the possibility of him landing at with a new team. Chargers' head coach Anthony Lynn explained why they decided to deal Inman. \"He got hurt and never really got a good chance to see him, and some other guys stepped ahead of him. We just wanted to get him someplace where he can be happy and play football .\" Despite being buried as the fourth or fifth receiver on the L.A. Chargers' depth chart, when healthy, Dontrelle Inman has the potential to be a lead pass-catcher. Dontrelle Inman gives the Chicago Bears a wide receiver with the ability to go up and get the football. [Image by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images] The addition of Dontrelle Inman is a timely one for the Chicago Bears. Just days after the Bears only completed four passes in their 17-3 win over the Carolina Panthers, they add Dontrelle Inman in the trade with the Chargers. Versus the Panthers, Mitch Trubisky only attempted seven throws. None of those passes went to Bears' receivers, despite Trubisky dealing with nine defenders at the line of scrimmage. With opposing teams looking to stop the Bears from running the football, the Bears had a need for a vertical threat. The receivers the Bears had on the roster have had their struggles separating from defenders. The presence of Dontrelle Inman could change things a bit. Inman hauled in 58 catches last season for the Chargers. He tallied up 810 yards and four touchdowns. This year Inman was seldom used, only catching two passes, while sitting behind Keenan Allen and Tyrell Williams. With the Bears, that is expected to change. Season ending injuries to Cameron Meredith and <mark>Kevin White</mark> forced the Bears to alter their depth chart. That left the Bears to rely on Kendall Wright, Tre McBride, and Tanner Gentry, among others. The addition of Dontrelle Inman will allow the incumbent receivers to be slotted in the positions they are best suited for. The timing of the Bears' acquisition of Inman is ideal. With Mitch Trubisky under center, the Bears have already scaled back their offensive playbook. Trubisky having a learning curve helps matters in a sense. If Inman makes his Bears' debut this week versus the New Orleans Saints, all the coaching staff has to do is implement a few routes to help him get acclimated early. The Bears have a bye week in Week 9. That gives Trubisky and Inman two weeks to get acquainted before the second half of the season starts. The #Bears added to their WR corps via a trade with the #Chargers: https: //t.co/ASHdSNwzHf--Pro Football Rumors (@ pfrumors) October 25, 2017 Few should expect Dontrelle Inman to make an immediate impact for the Bears in terms of the stat sheet. His true impact on the Bears may not be realized for weeks. Two weeks may be enough time for Inman and Trubisky to develop some chemistry going forward. The Bears' rookie quarterback knows that he has to develop rapport with his wide receivers (courtesy of AP News). \"It's all about rhythm, staying in a groove and really just continuing to evolve and find our identity and what works best for our offense to help out our defense .\" Dontrelle Inman's size and resume will dictate that be becomes the Chicago Bears' top receiver. Inman allows the Bears to play Kendall Wright as the slot receiver, with either Tanner Gentry or Tre McBride flanked on the other side. If a double-team is forced with regularity, it opens up the Bears' offense. Inman's presence alone could help the Chicago Bears going forward. It would be simply due to the fact that he is a big target for Mitch Trubisky to find down the field. Gaining separation will be paramount for Inman as he joins a Bears' team that struggles in that department. Mitch Trubisky establishing some continuity with Dontrelle Inman opens up the Chicago Bears' running game, as well as opportunities for Kendall Wright. If the Bears use the former L.A. Chargers' receiver properly, they could contend for the NFC North. The second half of the Bears' schedule is not as formidable as the first eight weeks. Not only does the Chicago Bears face the Cincinnati Bengals, who are struggling, they also have the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers to play. Both teams are currently winless. #Bears are eager to get newly-acquired receiver Dontrelle Inman up to speed, writes @ CEmma670: https: //t.co/bp4D0nsnqW pic.twitter.com/FVOTtOFpi7--670 The Score (@ 670TheScore) October 25, 2017 There is one primary reason for Bears' fans to have optimism for the pick up of Dontrelle Inman--free agency. Inman is a free agent at the end of the season. The Bears would benefit greatly from a motivated Inman, who can earn his return to the team next season with a strong showing. As for the Los Angeles Chargers, receiving a late draft pick from the Chicago Bears is better than not receiving any compensation for a solid receiver. The Chargers are deep at the position and could afford to trade Dontrelle Inman to the Bears. The trade currently stands as a win for both the Bears and the Chargers. It is also a win for Dontrelle Inman and Mitch Trubisky. Inman gets a fresh start with a Chicago Bears' team, which finds themselves quietly in a race for the NFC North. Trubisky gets a proven target to help the Bears win games. A hefty payday awaits the former Los Angeles Chargers' receiver if the he can help the Bears make things interesting in the second half of the season.

October 26, 2017 08:31 ET Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources Partners with Biochar Now and Enters into Exclusive Service Contract and Water Remediation Market Wholly Owned Subsidiary Resource Environmental Group Services \"REGS' Receives Exclusive Manufacturing, Management and Remediation Services Contract & Exclusive Technology Licensing Rights to Water Remediation in the Mining Market Throughout U.S. GOLDEN, CO--(Marketwired - October 26, 2017) - Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. (SEER) (OTCQB: SENR), a provider of environmental, renewable fuels and industrial waste stream management services, today announced that it has partnered with Biochar Now, (\"BCN\" ) a leading engineer and manufacturer of high-quality biochar. As a part of this new partnership, REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary of SEER, has received exclusive rights to perform all fabrication, manufacturing and environmental/remediation services required by BCN on all its water and soil clean up, reclamation or enhancement projects. In addition, REGS received an exclusive license under BCN's newly issued U.S. Patent Number 9,650,261 B2 (May 16, 2017) arising out of and related to water reclamation and clean up in and around the mining industry; a market REGS has serviced in the past. This license will be granted to a joint venture owned 90% by SEER and 10% by BCN. As part of the partnership, SEER made a $300,000 loan to BCN. The loan is in a super-priority position and paid back out of gross sale proceeds from BCN's currently operating Berthoud, Colorado production facility. For the loan, SEER has also received a small equity interest of approximately one percent of the privately held BCN. BCN, and its patented production technology, is emerging as one of the nation's premier producer of biochar. Biochar, considered as a more cost-effective alternative to activated carbon, is a solid material, obtained through thermochemical conversion of biomass (primarily wood) in a kiln. BCN has proprietary and patented procedures for this process resulting in a superior biochar product. The superiority of the BCN product has already been recognized by several states and many of the country's largest industrial and chemical companies that are currently developing programs and remediation plans to utilize the BCN product. All of these programs and remediation plans represent opportunities for REGS to provide services and support. The BCN product also has large potential for landfill soil remediation, a market that supplements MV's LFG gas capture technologies. Biochar has several applications within the reclamation market, from improving soil quality in agricultural, to removing various pollutants and unwanted components from water, such as phosphorous, mercury, arsenic and pesticides. REGS has already begun to work with leading water experts and service companies to expedite the deployment of this technology within the water treatment market. The addressable opportunity is significant, as the water recycling market is expected to grow 13.1% annually through 2021, to $22.3 B, according to BCC Research. As the number and scale of environmental cleanup projects around the world increase, the activated carbon global market, estimated to be $3 billion in 2015, is expected to exceed $10 billion by 2024 according to grandviewresearch.com. The superior quality biochar produced by Biochar Now is now being recognized by many industries and engineers as a more cost-effective and superior substitute for activated carbon in many applications. Given REGS' exclusive license and operational background in several Colorado mines, biochar is especially relevant for the mining industry, where it can sequester heavy metals and acids in the soil, preventing them from entering local water supplies. This more rapidly facilitates the return of vegetation, expediting the traditionally costly process of mine reclamation. In one study by the U.S. Forest Service, biochar performed better for re-vegetation than compost alone by 313%. \"This new partnership is part of SEER's ongoing effort to leverage REGS' 25 years of environmental service experience and diversify its business model into new mature and lucrative verticals,\" said <mark>John Combs</mark>, SEER's President and CEO. \"The addressable market for biochar is significant and growing rapidly. This fits perfectly into SEER's business portfolio objectives and presents an exciting and imminent revenue growth opportunity for SEER. We are particularly interested in the joint marketing opportunities between MV and BCN in the landfill market and have already begun discussions with a large landfill operator in Florida where MV has one of its largest LFG systems. In addition to this promising landfill opportunity, we have a potential pipeline of projects on the East Coast and in South Florida through our relationship with Biochar Now with some of the nation's largest industrial and chemical companies where REGS could provide service work and project management, in addition to manufacturing the kilns that would be required to fulfill increased product demand. We look forward to announcing these projects in the months to come,\" concluded <mark>Combs</mark>. \"We couldn't have found a better fit as service and support partners than SEER and its affiliated companies, especially REGS,\" said James Gaspard, BCN's CEO. \"REGS is right here in our backyard, they have used our biochar over the last year, they have impressive fabrication capabilities, and we are familiar with REGS' great reputation for service in the greater front-range area for over 20 years. In addition, SEER's other divisions, MV, SEM and Paragon, also bring expertise and experience in closely related areas such as gas conditioning, environmental materials production, pyrolysis, and solid waste destruction. All of these synergies make for multiple and potentially very lucrative opportunities for our companies as we can now offer services as part of our product offerings,\" continued Gaspard. \"As a real-world example of the possible synergies, in just a few weeks of joint marketing with SEER, Biochar Now has been able to identify and add millions of dollars to our product sales pipeline with companies that had already expressed interest in using our product after successful testing, but needed the full-service solution offered by REGS to implement our product in their processes,\" concluded Gaspard.

The bugle has been sounded and the rapiers are out. Allegations and verbal volleys are being lobbed. In the end, it's the image of the IOA that's getting sullied. But who bothers? The tussle between the president of the Indian Olympic Association N Ramachandran and secretary general Rajeev Mehta is out in the open. Days after the IOA president called for an Executive Council meeting on November 9, the secretary general sent out a letter calling for emergent EC meeting, but on November 7. The meet was called after 19 of 27 EC members met in New Delhi on Friday. It is learnt some of the present and past top sports administrators were present. The president is saying that according to IOA constitution only he has the right to call for a meeting, Mehta and Co believe that if the secretary has the mandate of the members, he too can call for the meeting. The two top officials of the IOA were not in agreement over the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the candidate for the president's post. There are 10 agendas listed for the meeting on November 7. The meeting will discuss \"regarding requisition notice already served to the president, IOA by approximately 70 per cent of the members\". One of them is to discuss the actions of \"the president, IOA which have brought down the image of IOA\". Mehta told Express that since 19 of the 27 members asked for the meeting on Nov 7, he couldn't have avoided to request. \"When so many members call for a meeting I can't stop it .\" He was also not happy that the president did not accede to the demand of 70 per cent members of the IOA who wanted a requisition meeting. A meeting of Ramachandran's supporters were held over dinner called by former IOA president Abhay Singh Chautala at Delhi Lawn Tennis Association (DLTA) on Thursday. It is learnt there were around seven to eight EC members were present. There are hectic parleys on for the posts of the treasurer of the body. It was in September (around 27/28) when, at a meeting in New Delhi between the president's rival faction, the idea of a requisition meeting was decided. The SGM, according to them, was necessitated because the term of the president and the current Office Bearers (OB) was over in March. And Ramachandran should have called for elections. The requisition for the SGM was however not considered by the IOA saying not enough members have signed the list. Interestingly, the list was handed over to the secretary who felt everything was in order for the president to call for an SGM. \"I felt the president should have called for the meeting,\" Mehta further added. Without SGM, Batra may not qualify as a presidential candidate. The IOA constitution (as it currently stands) doesn't allow a person who is not part of the executive board to contest the elections. The way things stand right now, the secretary seems to be enjoying the support of bigwigs like Narinder Batra, former IOA secretary generals Lalit Bhanot, <mark>Randhir Singh</mark>, vice-president RK Anand while the president has the support of former IOA president Chautala, former AITA president and treasurer Anil Khanna, senior vice president Virender Nanavati.

(AP)--Through enticement, advancement and the turbulence of coaching college football, Notre Dame first-year defensive coordinator Mike Elko will find himself this weekend across the field facing a group of players he once recruited to a program he helped build. Elko spent the last three seasons as the defensive coordinator at Wake Forest, which visits the fifth-ranked Fighting Irish (No. 3 CFP) on Saturday. It's a game Elko likely wishes had never been scheduled given the circumstances. \"I'm sure he would like to get through this (week) quickly,\" Notre Dame coach <mark>Brian Kelly</mark> said when asked about Elko's bittersweet reunion with his former players. \"It's never easy .\" Having a coach with first-hand knowledge of his former team might seem like an advantage for Notre Dame (7-1). But <mark>Kelly</mark> warned not to read too much into any benefits of inside info. After all, the Demon Deacons (5-3) can counter with a working knowledge of how Elko likes to attack an offensive opponent. Wake Forest averages 31.6 points per game, too. The success each program has enjoyed under Elko mirror each other. Elko came to Notre Dame as one of only two FBS coordinators with top-40 defenses in each of the past five years--three at Wake Forest and two at Bowling Green. Neither team is a perennial football power. \"We had lower-recruited players, but we had good players,\" Elko said upon his arrival at Notre Dame. \"We taught a defense that they understood, and we weren't asking kids to just make plays and do things that they weren't capable of doing .\" Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson knows what his team will be up against because it's what the Demon Deacons have been doing for some time now. \"They're one of the top teams in the country in limiting the run, creating turnovers,\" he said. \"Does that sound familiar? That's been Mike's M.O., try to make teams one-dimensional, and he's doing it .\" Clawson hired Elko as an assistant in 2009 when Clawson was the head coach at Bowling Green. The two coached and moved up together over the next eight years until Elko left Clawson for Notre Dame. The two also worked together at Fordham and Richmond from 2002 to 2005. Clawson expressed gratitude for Elko's service and wished him nothing but success--after this weekend. \"We know they're going to be well-coached, and Mike has made a big impact there already,\" Clawson said. \"He's a great coach. He's doing a great job (at Notre Dame) and I'm proud of him. But on Saturday, we want to beat him and he wants to beat us .\" With a defensive roster at Notre Dame filled with NFL prospects, leaving Wake Forest for a more prominent program seemed like an easy choice after last season. But Elko said his decision took great care and consideration, and the improvement followed. After finishing last season No. 104 in takeaways with only 14, Elko's Irish rank No. 11 in the country this season with 18 turnovers gained. Notre Dame allows only 16.1 points a game, the 10th best mark in the country. It has also given up only one rushing touchdown this season, the fewest in the FBS, and opponents have scored just 10 red zone touchdowns in 25 trips. Irish senior captain Drue Tranquill said there is no single reason for the success and turnaround from last season. He calls it a collection of shifts and changes that all correlate to Elko's arrival. Elko moved Tranquill from a strong safety last year to a rover (a safety/linebacker hybrid) this season and the production has followed. \"I don't know that you can point the finger at any one thing that has led to the change,\" said Tranquill, who leads the Irish with 6.5 tackles for loss and also has 1.5 sacks, three fumble recoveries, one forced fumble and an interception. \"It's just the all-around mental preparation of our team has been much better. I never walk into a game feeling inferior in terms of my mental preparation with our new coaching staff .\" Elko isn't the only former Wake Forest coach on <mark>Kelly</mark>'s staff, either. Chuck Lea, who coached linebackers at Wake Forest last season under Elko, is now doing the same job at Notre Dame. Clawson was asked about Notre Dame's improved defense this season. \"Well, they hired two guys from Wake Forest,\" he said. \"So I think that's what happened .\" ___ AP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary contributed. ___ More AP college football: http: //www.collegefootball.ap.org and https: //twitter.com/AP_Top25 Share this:", "articleID": "2017110207_00211351_W", "names": {"Brian Kelly": ["Q16186315", "Q16730700", "Q18098352", "Q194016", "Q21259238", "Q22920229", "Q28873135", "Q48773396", "Q4964312", "Q4964313", "Q4964314", "Q4964315", "Q4964316", "Q4964318", "Q4964319", "Q4964321", "Q4964322", "Q57431309", "Q58039928"]}}, {"date": "2017-11-02", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/general-electric-stock-suffering-worst-slump-since-the-recession/article36812936/?cmpid=rss1", "content": "Open this photo in gallery: In this Monday, June 12, 2017, file photo, the General Electric logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Richard Drew/AP Richard Clough Bloomberg News November 2, 2017 It must be feeling an awful lot like 2009 for General Electric Co. shareholders. That's not a good thing. The stock fell Thursday afternoon as it careened toward a ninth straight daily loss, which would be the longest in eight years. During the latest streak, GE also suffered the worst single-week decline since March 2009 and closed its biggest monthly drop since February of that year. The recession-era slump has become a frequent point of comparison as the industrial giant struggles with a raft of problems, from poor cash flow to weak power and oil markets. New Chief Executive Officer <mark>John Flannery</mark> has said he'll consider all options to revitalize GE, which is the worst performer by far on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.

GE dropped 37 per cent this year through Wednesday, wiping out more than $100-billion in market value, even as broader indexes rose. JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday cut its price target for GE to $17 a share from $19, with analyst Stephen Tusa citing weak revenue and profit in the power-generation business. Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, warned that a rebound may be underwhelming. \"Once the bottom is in, GE will still have a challenging growth outlook,\" Sprague said in a note. \"While there could be a short-term technical pop, the fundamental recovery will take time .\" Investors and analysts are also bracing for a possible dividend cut, particularly after the Boston-based company last month slashed its cash-flow forecast for 2017. <mark>Flannery</mark>, who took the top post in August, hasn't ruled out such a move.

Locals say the high volume of visitors and traffic at the Fairy Pools has become \"too much to bear\". Minginish Community Hall Association (MCHA) is the first to make use of a scheme which allows publicly-owned forestry assets to be transferred for the benefit of local communities. The scheme is run by Forest Enterprise Scotland (FES). The MCHA bought the 12.3 hectares of land for \u00a3 2,500 - a discount of \u00a3 27,500 on the market value - because of the \"substantial public benefit that will be delivered\". \"World-class attraction' The series of waterfalls and pools in Glen Brittle have become a major tourist attraction and the area was recently named by travel guide Wanderlust as the best place in Britain for wild swimming. Local MSP <mark>Kate Forbes</mark> said there were more than 108,000 visitors to the Fairy Pools last year, but access is restricted by a single-track road and a 35-space car park. The MCHA plans to make space for 137 cars and about 20 mini-buses and camper vans in a bid to reduce congestion.

She said:\" I am delighted FES have agreed to the sale of this land, which will help the local community respond to the pressures and opportunities that come with having a world-class attraction like the Fairy Pools on your doorstep. \"We recognise the recent surge in interest seen by some of our tourism sites, particularly in rural locations. That is why we recently announced a new \u00a3 6m Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund .\" Alongside the Skye strategic group, the Scottish government will continue to do all we can to support sustainable growth in tourism, working in partnership with local communities - in Skye, throughout the Highlands & Islands and across Scotland. \"\"Too much to bear' Julie Burnett, a director of MCHA, said:\" This is a key milestone in the project to provide improved parking facilities close to the Fairy Pools. \"The community benefit of the land transfer and the overall project cannot be overstated .\" Both residents living in Glen Brittle and future visitors to the Fairy Pools will benefit from the proposal to expand and improve the existing small car park. \"Ms <mark>Forbes</mark> said a\" robust \"tourist strategy was needed for Skye as a whole to improve infrastructure .\" The situation at the Fairy Pools has really become too much to bear for local residents who just want to go about their daily lives, \"she said .\" The single-track road is far too narrow for the volume of traffic parked at the Fairy Pools. \"We've reached a point where enough is enough and I'm pleased the Scottish government is facilitating the community asset transfer at the Fairy Pools .\" She said she had begun a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the island. \"Tourists are welcome on Skye, it's our responsibility to ensure the infrastructure is prepared for them,\" she said.", "articleID": "2017110313_00709375_W", "names": {"Kate Forbes": ["Q24039479", "Q28007154"]}}, {"date": "2017-11-03", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/business/technology/philadelphia-patrons-line-up-outside-walnut-street-apple-store-for-the-new-iphone-x-cook-timothy-stock-20171103.html", "content": "Over 100 people were lined up covering half the 1600 block of Walnut Street on Friday, waiting to snag the newly released iPhone X from the Apple Store. The doors opened at 8 a.m. Friday, but police say customers had lined up as early as 8:30 pm the night before in an attempt to be among the first to pick up the pricey new smart phone. The iPhone X comes with many new features, such as facial recognition software, a larger screen, and a faster processor. Despite its high price--around $1,000 for the base model--people still came out in droves to get it. \"I have the antique, the iPhone 4S, it really is time for an upgrade,\" said Elaine Davidson, 54, a musician from Dallas, Texas who was in Philadelphia to perform with the Phantom of the Opera musical. Davidson said she drives constantly, and the new phone would make it easier for her to listen to music as she navigated to a new city. \"I primarily want the [iPhone X] because of the better camera. I have an iPhone 6, and I usually get a new phone every two years so it is about time .\" said Jason McAndrew, 37, a marketing manager from Philadelphia who stood near the back of the line. McAndrew had ordered the phone, but said he would have to wait two weeks for it to arrive, so he hoped to get the phone Friday if the wait was not too unreasonable. For those who wish to avoid waiting at an Apple Store, the phone can be purchased online at Apple.com. Apple's stock has risen about 3 percent by midday, primarily due to the release of the iPhone X. The iPhone line is the company's dominant product, accounting for about two-thirds of Apple's total sales. Chief Executive Officer <mark>Tim Cook</mark> has focused on growing services, like Apple Music and iCloud, so the company can better bind consumers to Apple's hardware products. \"I've been waiting about two hours. This phone is the new thing, and I want to be one of the first to try it out so I can optimize my client's apps,\" said Gilson Nunes, 27, a developer who said he owns a small company in Brazil.
