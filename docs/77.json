an external review looking into how to improve customer service at the toronto transit commission is calling for sweeping changes that it admits will not come cheap. renewed focus on customer service at the ttc is \"long overdue,\" the report released monday said. it issued 78 recommendations on how to improve the experience of the estimated 1.5 million riders who use the system daily, including changes in governance, like the appointment of a \"chief customer service officer\" and an internal customer service advisory group. the report notes, however, that the \"initiative will be costly to implement and maintain, and some recommendations may lead to changes in ttc policy. still, the result will be worth the considerable effort and investment of resources .\" the question, of course, is: where will the money come from? \"the report didn't provide estimates for how much the recommendations would cost. ttc vice-chair joe mihevc cautioned that some of the recommendations might not be adopted anytime soon .\" i think at this point today, we want to hear the recommendations and bring them inside the commission. doing a cost evaluation and that i think that's some homework that we will need to do, \"he said .\" so there are some things that i think you will see the ttc embrace, and embrace very quickly. other things require money and reorganization and a lot more thoughtfulness as to how to do them, and we will need to take some time to do that, \"said mihevc. the ttc commissioned the report in january after being peppered with complaints about service. it appointed a panel of 10 external experts headed by <mark>steve o'brien</mark>, general manager of one king west hotel & residence to draw up the report. the panel members, all volunteers, aren't receiving payment. some of the report's recommendations include: the report was originally supposed to be released june 30. it was delayed by what the ttc called the\" depth and volume of [the panel's] work, combined with their own professional commitments. \"the transit agency hit the news over the conduct of some of its frontline workers early this year, including a collector who was pictured snoozing while on the job. the ttc also had to deal with the fallout from this year's 25-cent fare hike and a shortage of tokens ahead of the price increase. in 2009, the ttc received 31,000 complaints between jan. 1 and nov. 30, a 15 per cent rise over 2008 .\" the customer service panel's work is an absolute start in a new direction for the ttc, \"said mihevc.", "articleID": "2010082422_00306001_W", "names": {"Steve O'Brien": ["Q16212485", "Q55196718"]}}, {"date": "2010-08-24", "url": "http://nature.com/news/2010/100824/full/news.2010.421.html?s=news_rss", "content": "globally, india ranks second in terms of total land area under plantation. <mark>w.</mark> laurance native forests in india are disappearing at a rate of up to 2.7% per year. the figures, published in an analysis of the country's forest cover, stand in stark contrast to those of a 2009 survey by an indian governmental organization, which said that forests have expanded by 5% over the past decade. india is among the most densely forested countries in the world, and in 2008 the government announced goals to increase forest cover by nearly 10% by 2012. the india state of forest report 2009 by the forest survey of india (fsi) indicated that the outlook was good. but william laurance, a conservation biologist at <mark>james cook</mark> university in cairns, queensland, australia, and one of the authors of the analysis, to be published in the journal conservation letters 1, says that while the figures showing that forest cover in india has grown are \"technically correct\" , they are also \"misleading\". \"we found a very real and serious loss of native forest,\" he says, adding that it could put india ahead of most other countries in terms of deforestation. nature contacted the fsi for comment, but they did not respond by the time of publication. india has been busy planting trees, including non-native eucalyptus and acacia, to provide timber and fuel wood - and in some cases to earn money from selling carbon credits under the clean development mechanism established in 2001 as part of the kyoto protocol. the country now ranks second globally in terms of total land area under plantation. laurance says that much of india's claimed growth in forest cover has come from plantations, and that this is masking a fall in native forests. \"the indian government has made a big deal of increasing forest cover. but they are not distinguishing between natural and artificial forests,\" he says. a growing problem this is bad for the environment because replanting native forests with non-native trees damages local biodiversity, says <mark>neil burgess</mark>, a conservation biologist at the university of copenhagen. \"most plantations of non-native trees have very low biological value. they are only good to store carbon,\" he says. this distinction between native and non-native trees is important for an accurate picture of the state of the world's forests, says laurance. in the analysis, the researchers assessed data on the growth in indian plantations collected for the food and agricultural organization (fao) of the united nations. it estimates that plantations grew by around 15,400 square kilometres a year between 1995 and 2005. the researchers subtracted the rates of plantation expansion from the growth in total forest cover as measured by remote-sensing imagery, and found that coverage of native indian forests actually declined by 1.5-2 .7% between 1995 and 2005 - an \"alarming\" average of 2.4% a year and a loss of more than 124,000 square kilometres over the decade. the researchers checked these figures against changes in forest biovolume (the volume of wood and other above-ground forest material), estimated from field observations in the fsi report. they found a loss in native forest biovolume of around 2.7% per year. a resolution for change laurance says that some assessments of forest cover, such as that carried out by the fao, do not distinguish between native forests and plantations. they rely on relatively coarse data from sources including the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer satellites, which have a resolution of 1.1 square kilometres per pixel. but the indian remote sensing satellites used by the fsi have a much higher resolution - up to 23.5 square metres per pixel - so the agency has the means to distinguish native forests from plantations of non-native trees. laurance says he is hopeful that the united nations' redd + initiative to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation - which includes a focus on conservation and sustainable management of forests - will encourage india and other countries in similar situations to distinguish between native and artificial forests, and pay more attention to protecting the former. advertisement he says that countries such as norway - the programme's first and largest donor - will be interested more in paying to stop deforestation of native forests than in expanding plantations. bhaskar vira, an environmental economist at the university of cambridge, uk, says that he thinks \"there is probably some truth\" in the study's finding. but he warns that not all the trees planted each year reach maturity and show up in satellite imagery. because the authors subtracted the fao figures for the total area covered by plantations from a satellite-based estimate of total forest cover, the study may have overestimated the amount of deforestation taking place. laurance agrees that the data on plantations is \"rough\" , but points out that the calculations of loss in biovolume used forest survey of india data. the figures derived were similar to his estimates for deforestation, so he is confident in the results. references puyravaud, j.-p ., davidar, p. & laurance, <mark>w. f.</mark> conserv. lett. doi:10.1111 / j.1755-263x .2010.00141 (2010).", "articleID": "2010082500_00671149_W", "names": {"James Cook": ["Q11309434", "Q18009158", "Q26281510", "Q28155375", "Q50360082", "Q59309681", "Q6131673", "Q6131676", "Q6143873"], "Neil Burgess": ["Q23657268", "Q42822075", "Q6988330"], "W.

<mark>newman</mark>, who took second place in the state's top-two primary with 17.4 percent of the vote, continuously saw fellow republican dusty gulleson and democrat tom pasma inch closer to him since the tuesday, august 17 primary. in the end he was able to escape both being overtaken as well as triggering an automatic recount and will join democrat kris lytton in the general election. lytton overwhelmingly took first place with 26.3 percent of the vote. democrat tom pasma, the money frontrunner who had a large swath of traditionally-democratic support from labor and other groups, came in third. he had 15.7 percent of the vote. republican dusty gulleson came in fourth with 15.6 percent. she has previously said she was pleased to move forward and appreciated her support across the district, which includes the lower half of whatcom county, a portion of skagit county and all of the san juan islands. \"we're excited,\" <mark>newman</mark> said tuesday, aug. 24. \"we're going to keep doing a lot of the same things we've been doing .\" <mark>newman</mark> said he made a strategic decision to focus on skagit county in the primary, where he believes there are more conservative voters than in san juan and whatcom counties for the 40th district. now, though, he said he'll start reaching out more to other counties, especially whatcom. but the mount vernon real estate agent may have an uphill battle in his bid to beat lytton. the 40th seat being vacated by longtime rep. quall has been in democratic party hands since 1986. though not a perfect reflection of what's to come in the general election, democrats in the nine-way 40th primary took at least 54 percent of the vote. <mark>newman</mark> said he understood the issue, noting democrats had about 10 points on republicans, but he felt confident moving forward. \"i think once we start debating the issues more one on one, people will realize they'll have to make a change,\" <mark>newman</mark> said.

solve. harvin after another battery of tests last week, and a promising 2010 preseason debut, harvin hopes he is getting closer to figuring out a debilitating medical condition that has plagued him for most of his life. minnesota vikings receiver had two catches for 30 yards and took two big shots to the head saturday night in a preseason victory over seattle, the first time he's played this year after being stricken by migraines for most of training camp. \"i felt great,\" harvin said after the game. \"just glad to get back out there with my teammates and work some of the rust off. i've got a lot of work to do, conditioning-wise, but it felt good to get out there .\" harvin has barely practiced this month while dealing with the death of his grandmother and a string of headaches that have been maddeningly random and devastatingly severe. no one knows exactly when they're going to occur or what triggers them. even more frustrating, doctors and trainers have been unable to come up with a treatment to neutralize them. the vikings have gone to great lengths to try to identify the causes and understand the problem. \"it's kind of a tenuous thing,\" coach brad childress told the associated press last month. \"what can exacerbate migraines? stress? check. fatigue? check. head or neck trauma? hmmm .\" espn.com's kevin seifert writes about all things nfc north in his division

don't want the easy way out sometimes. it's life, i'm dealing with it. i finally got back and it's good to be back out here with my teammates .\" he missed one game last year because of the headaches and missed several practices in the playoffs. but teammates and coaches got their first real glimpse of how serious they can be on aug. 19, when harvin vomited and collapsed on the practice field. he was taken by ambulance to a local hospital and spent the night. more tests ensued and harvin surprisingly suited up for the game saturday night despite not practicing all week. \"i did a test [friday] night and they found some things that we think was the main cause of it,\" harvin said. \"we're feeling really confident. i know we said that a couple times, but i think this time we found what the main cause was. i'm not saying i'll never get a headache again, but hopefully we can slow it down a little bit .\" the vikings know they have to be cautious in their optimism, but they were treating that development as good news for the reigning offensive rookie of the year. sidney rice out for possibly the entire first half of the season with a hip injury, harvin's importance to the offense has

all pro <mark>chris johnson</mark> found himself stymied and left tackle <mark>michael roos</mark> banged his right knee in an ugly preseason loss. at least the tennessee titans can console themselves with how well the defense played. a unit so woeful in 2009 giving up an average of 25.1 points per game was the only bright spot in the titans' 15-7 loss at carolina on saturday night. top draft pick <mark>derrick morgan</mark> finally made his nfl debut, and the titans kept a carolina squad looking for its first touchdown this preseason out of the end zone despite the panthers' first team playing three quarters. \"defensively, we kept things basic and played hard and played well,\" coach <mark>jeff fisher</mark> said sunday. \"we tackled well, we rushed well, we covered well, so i thought we had a pretty good day defensively against an offense that was trying to score points .\" the titans (1-2) were playing their second game in six days, not counting a joint practice with arizona midweek. they also played without starting tackle <mark>tony brown</mark>, who remains on the physically unable to perform list, or cornerback cortland finnegan, who has missed the first three preseason games because of a strained groin. tennessee limited carolina to 241 yards through three quarters and 51 yards rushing. deangelo williams had a meager 13 yards on nine carries. carolina had to settle for two field goals, the last in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter with the titans already having subbed into their third-team defensive players. <mark>morgan</mark> was the highlight, playing 15 snaps after having missed all but the final day of training camp because of a strained calf. the 16th pick out of georgia tech strung together four straight plays in which he barely missed his first sack, enough in his debut to excite defensive line coach jim washburn. \"needless to say, he was quite impressive with his first four considering the fact that this was the first time he had full pads on since last january against iowa,\" <mark>fisher</mark> said. \"i thought his first outing was pretty impressive, if you take into consideration he is rushing against a starting nfl tackle as well .\" <mark>morgan</mark> got out on the field during the titans' opening defensive series, and <mark>fisher</mark> said they saw the strength, power and good hands that convinced the team to draft him. \"he had two hits on the quarterback and had an assist and a tackle for loss in the first four plays and was equally as effective in the other 11,\" <mark>fisher</mark> said. the titans also have yet to decide who starts opposite finnegan. jason mccourty and rookie alterraun verner are in a tight battle, and <mark>fisher</mark> isn't giving any hints. \"nothing says i can't play them both in the regular season,\" the coach said. <mark>fisher</mark> expects <mark>brown</mark> back this thursday night when the titans host the defending super bowl champion new orleans saints (2-1) to wrap up the preseason. it's another short week with little time to work on an offense that looked very inept in carolina. tennessee managed only 50 yards in the first half on 25 plays. <mark>johnson</mark> ran eight times for only 10 yards. young was 6 of 9 for 48 yards. but the titans got only four first downs, just as many times as the panthers sacked young, as they went through their first preseason game without scoring at least one touchdown. young, sacked all of nine times in his 12 appearances in 2009, already has been sacked five times this preseason. the panthers took him down four times saturday night, keeping offensive line coach mike munchak busy on the sideline reacting to fronts they hadn't practiced against. <mark>fisher</mark> insisted he wasn't concerned about his offense, especially not after seeing all the panthers did defensively on tape. \"we kept things basic and simple, and we just wanted to let players play. we didn't scheme or come into the game with much of a game plan,\" he said. notes: <mark>fisher</mark> said <mark>roos</mark> will not need any examinations on his knee. he has started 80 straight games in the regular season, third among all tackles ....rookie damian williams dislocated his right shoulder when he was hit and fumbled on a punt return. but he returned and played wide receiver in the
