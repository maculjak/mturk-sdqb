A Gulf Opec delegate told Reuters the GCC had reached a consensus not to cut oil output. Three Opec delegates separately told Reuters they believed Opec was unlikely to cut output when the 12-member organisation meets on Thursday. The Opec meeting will be one of its most crucial in recent years, with oil having tumbled to below $78 a barrel due to the US shale boom and slower economic growth in China and Europe. Cutting output unilaterally would effectively mean for Opec, which accounts for a third of global oil output, a further loss of market share to North American shale oil producers. If Opec decided against cutting and rolled over existing output levels on Thursday, that would effectively mean a price war that the Saudis and other Gulf producers could withstand due to their large foreign-exchange reserves. Other members, such as Venezuela or Iran, would find it much more difficult. Brent crude was trading down 73 cents at $77.60 a barrel at 21:19. Naimi said earlier on Wednesday he expected the oil market \"to stabilise itself eventually\" , after talks with non-Opec member Russia on Tuesday yielded no pledge from Moscow to tackle a global oil glut jointly. The UAE sided with Naimi, saying oil prices would soon stabilise, while ramping up pressure on non-Opec nations. \"This is not a crisis that requires us to panic...we have seen (prices) way lower,\" UAE Oil Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told Reuters. \"The oversupply came from the evolution of the unconventional oil production...I think everyone needs to play a role in balancing the market, not Opec unilaterally,\" he said. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said some Opec members, although not Iran, were now gearing up for a battle over market share. \"Some Opec members believe that this is the time where we need to defend market share...All the experts in the market believe we have oversupply in the market and next year we will have more oversupply,\" he added. The group could opt to roll over output levels but stress the importance of better compliance, while also agreeing to hold an extraordinary meeting if prices keep falling, several Opec watchers have suggested. Price war Among the members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela and Iraq have called for output cuts. Opec's traditional price hawk Iran said on Wednesday its views were now close to those of Saudi Arabia. Zangeneh said there was unity inside Opec to \"monitor the market carefully\" but made no mention of a cut. \"The onslaught of North American shale oil has drastically undermined Opec's position and reduced its market share,\" said Dr <mark>Gary Ross</mark>, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group. Russia, which produces 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) or 11% of global oil, came to Tuesday's meeting amid hints it might agree to cut output as it suffers from oil's price fall and Western sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine. But as that meeting with Naimi and officials from Venezuela and non-Opec member Mexico ended, Russia's most influential oil official, state firm Rosneft's head Igor Sechin, emerged with a surprise message - Russia will not reduce output even if oil falls to $60 per barrel. Sechin added that he expected low oil prices to do more damage to producing nations with higher costs, in a clear reference to the US shale boom. On Wednesday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he expected the country's output to be flat next year. Many at Opec were surprised by Sechin's suggestion that Russia - in desperate need of oil prices above $100 per barrel to balance its budget - was ready for a price war. \"Gulf states are less bothered about a price drop compared to other Opec members,\" an Opec source close to Gulf thinking said. Opec publications have shown that global supply will exceed demand by more than 1 million bpd in the first half of next year. While the statistics speak in favour of a cut, the build-up to the Opec meeting has seen one of the most heated debates in years about the next policy step for the group. 24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our SA's best and worst cellphone contracts AnswerIt Get your financial questions answered.

The spin-off of DreamWorks Animation's \"Madagascar\" franchise made $25.8 million in its first weekend from 3,762 locations and $36 million over the five day holiday. It had been expected to generate in the mid to high $40 million range in ticket sales.

It pulled in $23 million for the five day period from 3,375 locations, a shadow of the $35 million it was expected to make. The good news is that with a $43 million production budget, the\" Bosses \"sequel was relatively inexpensive to cook up. Overall, the Thanksgiving box office was down 20% from 2013.

Missing 16-year-old from Milton Keynes: Police launch appeal Chief constable of Thames Valley Police quits force Dual carriageway linking Milton Keynes and Cambridge welcomed by city MP Milton Keynes travel: A5 northbound closed after accident Attempted cashpoint robbery in central Milton Keynes HMP Woodhill not in lock down - Ministry Of Justice \"It is vital Milton Keynes moves on after taxi-gate' Reaction to proposed cuts to Milton Keynes' services:\" It's appalling' Karl Robinson remained tight lipped about his MK Dons side's promotion chances after a smash-and-grab victory over Sheffield United on Tuesday night. Dele Alli's 86th minute winner was enough to snatch all three points for Dons at Bramall Lane in the 1-0 win - a victory which sees Dons climb to third in the table, now just a point off the automatic promotion spots. But with just 17 games under their belt, there's still a long way to go in the season, even if some are beginning to wonder whether this is finally the season. Robinson though still believes there are bigger teams in the division who could flex their muscles in January to make life harder for Dons in the final furlongs. \"People have been speaking about that for a while,\" he said. \"We need to have a really good look at what we want to do in January .\" The group is very strong. We can play with class and style and we can dig deep. I don't know how much people wanted to be here last season, but everyone wants to be here now. \"People look at us, respect us and consider us a team to beat, but we're still not one of the big four. Far from it .\" We're always up there and knock on doors. We're a team people want to beat, but you've seen a different side to us, one that I haven't seen in a while. These results are bigger than the 6-0 results. \"It wasn't a vintage Dons performance at Bramall Lane, but it was a performance borne out of necessity. With United hot on Dons' heels in League 1, and the best part of 17,000 voices urging them on from the sidelines, Robinson's side set out to do what they had to to take something from the game. And right up until Alli's late strike, Dons looked more than happy to take a share of the points back with them down the M1. After that, Dons had to indulge in the uglier side of football to get home safely. Clever fouls in innocuous positions, bookings - though in <mark>Danny Green</mark>'s case, two bookings and his marching orders - and general time wasting were the order the final 10 minutes, prompting a hostile reception from the home support as Dons celebrated their win at the final whistle .\" We didn't deserve to win, \"admitted Robinson afterwards .\" We weren't great tonight, but you can't always be as good as we were on Saturday. \"They're a very good side, managed by a very good manager .\" I know we got booed at the end, but we did what we had to do at the end of the game, and we rolled our sleeves up. I won't apologise for my players putting their bodies on the line. \"We haven't done it often enough - come to a big team and win. That's as good as it gets .\" People have commented on my sides being pretty on the eye but haven't been able to dig results out. * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.

Torrential rain deluged swaths of drought-hit California on Tuesday, bringing floods and traffic accidents across the state and prompting evacuations amid fears of destructive mudslides. After a scorching drought which is the worst in California since records began, a powerful storm front lashed the region from the southern border with Mexico to the northern boundary with Oregon. A large truck was left dangling over a highway overpass in one accident while the celebrity enclave of Malibu was left isolated after rains knocked over power lines and forced the closure of roads leading to the coastal town. Up to 10.16 cm of rain was expected to be dumped across parts of the region, with hillside communities feared to be most at risk of mudslides after years of drought which have stripped slopes of stabilising vegetation. In the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora and communities of Camarillo and Silverado Canyon, more than 120 people were evacuated over fears of mudslides. \"With the rain, it's just moving it down the hill where nature wants to take it,\" Camarillo Springs resident <mark>Barbara Williams</mark> told KTLA 5 local television. \"Unfortunately, we have some homes in the way of where nature wants to go .\" Local television showed residents frantically laying sandbags around properties in an effort to protect homes in the event of mudslides. Los Angeles County Fire Department deputy chief <mark>Steve Martin</mark> warned residents in hillside communities not to risk staying in their homes if required to evacuate. \"We know it's an inconvenience, we know it's hard to leave your homes behind, but the fact of the matter is if the mountains does cut loose, it happens so fast you're already behind,\" The Los Angeles Times quoted him as saying. Several neighbourhoods in Los Angeles were given a record soaking, with the 2.9 cm dumped on the city's downtown surpassing the old mark of 2.79 set on December 2, 1961, according to the National Weather Service. More heavy rain is expected across the region on Wednesday before the storm eases towards the weekend.
