My wishes for all are joy and health in the days ahead. The years fly by; where did they go? So swiftly they flew, as an arrow shot into the night is quickly lost to sight. How many years have we lost moaning over hurts and mistakes now long past? Forgive and forget. Let them go! It is time, you know. The bells are ringing in a new year. We can begin anew with good intentions and can endeavor to mend those fences and use another road not taken. As the famous philosopher Goethe wrote: \"One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words .\" Goethe should have included in his list laughter doeth good as fine medication, or \"a laugh a day keeps the doctor away,\" which has been proven true. Also, he should include nature's healing touch. Nature is very important to me. If I feel anxious or upset, I lean against a huge oak, and it seems to impart its strength and endurance, which renews my soul. Fortunately, I am able to adhere to Goethe's advice. Every day, the songs of birds fall upon my ears. I do not often come across good poetry that appeals to me. I am used to poems that rhyme. Fine pictures, I see every day. I only have to gaze upon <mark>Tom Russell</mark>'s wonderful \"Margaret's High Pasture,\" hanging in my living room. It pleasures my eyes. My daughter Tricia Spencer presented me, at Christmas, her beautiful painting of a group of red apples, which is hanging in my dining area. I feel my columns, which I work on almost every day, represent \"a few reasonable words .\" The following poem, which I wrote, does not in any way represent good poetry. \"Now I am old, red I will wear. It will go well with my snow white hair. The sun still sets in flaming red. That color's mine, gaily she said. Oh, not for me cold purple's shroud. I'll flaunt my age and cry aloud. Like setting sun on yonder hill, tinting every cloud at will. I too will set in flaming red, clouds of glory around my head!\" "}, {"articleID": "2016071111_00077944_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"], "Robert Deleo": ["Q7343448", "Q924486"], "Charlie Baker": ["Q28051620", "Q5076629", "Q5084482", "Q56254750"], "Tommy Chang": ["Q19560219", "Q7819296"], "Michael Norton": ["Q23662981", "Q27831086", "Q42310522", "Q6018038"], "Brad Jones": ["Q26834399", "Q2923402", "Q299228", "Q4954040", "Q4954041", "Q4954042", "Q56280650", "Q896802"], "Katherine Clark": ["Q58757120", "Q6376330"], "Adrian Walker": ["Q4685414", "Q4685415"]}, "date": "2016-07-11", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/massachusetts-playbook/2016/07/equal-pay-bill-incoming-mind-those-budget-earmarks-happy-birthday-ed-markey-215241", "content": "The fights before the convention fight in Cleveland Christie builds his case for <mark>Trump</mark>'s VP Why <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> won't accept--or dismiss--<mark>Donald Trump</mark> The Year the Veepstakes Really Mattered An Unfair Tragedy for Unlucky Dallas Politico Massachusetts Playbook Lauren Dezenski's must-read rundown of what's up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

COMING THIS WEEK: EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION--Debate and a likely vote on the House's take on equal pay legislation which passed the Senate unanimously is expected to appeal to all sides thanks to tweaks from the House. More from yours truly in POLITICO Massachusetts--\"While the House language was not yet available late last week, those involved with negotiations say the bill will be amenable to all parties. It is currently being tweaked in the House Committee on Ways and Means .\" ...\"\"I would say that it's similar to the Senate version,' said Rep. Patricia Haddad, a Somerset Democrat. The main difference, she said, is that the House worked more closely with Associated Industries of Massachusetts in developing the legislation .\" ...\"In January, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to shrink the gap between men and women's wages by prohibiting potential employers from asking about salary history and establishing a definition for\" comparable work. \"'\" Associated Industries of Massachusetts, or AIM, was critical of the Senate's language. The group's president, Rick Lord, confirmed that his team has been closely working with House leadership as well as the Attorney General's office \"to hopefully come up with a bill out of the House that we would support .\" '...\"The Massachusetts High Tech Council, another group pushing back against the Senate proposal, sent a similar signal .\" Based on the conversations we've been having, we're optimistic about the House-produced bill. It will be an improvement over what the Senate did,' said public policy and communications executive vice president Mark Gallagher. \"READ ON--http: //politi.co/29ssPOE Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Massachusetts has one of the cleanest and lowest carbon-producing power generation systems in the nation. In fact, transportation today represents twice the carbon emissions of power plants in the Commonwealth. And despite talk of an \"energy cost crisis,\" the last two years have seen the lowest electricity prices in more than a decade. The energy plan being pushed on Beacon Hill, however, puts all this progress at risk by outsourcing up to a third of our electricity market to government-owned Canadian utilities and locking consumers into decades-long hydro contracts. If passed by the legislature, energy bills are estimated to increase by up to $777 million each year for Massachusetts families and businesses. Government-owned Canadian hydro is expensive, unreliable and not the solution for Massachusetts. Learn more: bit. ly/2928S3h ** Want to make an impact?

(AP Photo/Keith Ridler, File) Posted: Wednesday, February 7, 2018 5:13 pm Court: Idaho nuclear waste documents won't be made public Associated Press | 0 comments BOISE, Idaho (AP)--U.S. officials don't have to provide details about proposed shipments of extremely radioactive spent commercial nuclear fuel to the country's top government nuclear research laboratory in Idaho, a federal court has ruled. The ruling was a major setback to a lawsuit filed by former Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who had a long history of legal battles with the Energy Department over nuclear waste entering the state and a firm belief that residents had a right to know the agency's plans. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill on Tuesday ruled the federal agency acted properly in withholding information sought by Andrus in a Freedom of Information Act request he filed in January 2015. That decision means the documents will not be released to the public anytime soon, but they ultimately could be as another part of Andrus' argument has yet to play out and the case remains open. Andrus, a Democrat who died in August at age 85, filed the lawsuit in September 2015 after receiving heavily blacked-out documents from the federal agency about the spent commercial nuclear fuel shipments. His daughter, Tracy Andrus, has been substituted with the court's approval as the plaintiff in the case. The former governor's longtime aide, <mark>Marc Johnson</mark>, said he was disappointed with Tuesday's ruling in favor of the Department of Energy, \"particularly after waiting so long to see what DOE really has in mind for further waste in Idaho .\" The lawsuit seeks information about several hundred pounds of proposed research shipments of spent commercial nuclear fuel the federal agency wants to send to the Idaho National Laboratory, the nation's top federal nuclear research lab. The shipments required a waiver to a nuclear waste agreement the Energy Department and Idaho signed in 1995 limiting nuclear waste shipments to Idaho. The agreement followed federal court victories by then Gov. Andrus at a time when he feared the state was becoming a repository for the nation's nuclear waste. Andrus, before his death from complications from cancer, contended that signing such a waiver would open the state up to receiving tons of nuclear waste from around the nation, and is why he sought information about the Energy Department's plans. In August 2016, Winmill ordered the Energy Department to provide the court with the documents Andrus wanted to determine whether the agency's redactions fell within exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act. Winmill on Tuesday ruled they did. \"The court will sustain DOE's assertion of privilege, and not require it to provide the plaintiff with a copy of any of the documents,\" he wrote. Energy Department officials didn't immediately respond to inquiries from The Associated Press on Wednesday. The agency has previously said it wants to better understand \"high burnup\" spent fuel that is accumulating at nuclear power plants in the U.S.. The fuel stays longer in nuclear reactors than other nuclear fuel and produces more energy. But its spent fuel comes out hotter and more radioactive than fuel that does not stay so long in reactors. In Winmill's 2016 order, he also directed the Energy Department to determine whether the redacted material \"would relate to the public's interest, rather than that of the agency itself .\" He said if the information wasn't in the public's interest, the agency had to explain why, and not just site the policy underlying the exemption. Winmill in that order is telling the Energy Department to explain why releasing the information would not be in the public interest of Idaho residents, said Andrus' lawyer, Laird Lucas, with the Advocates for the West legal firm that often represents environmental groups. He said the federal agency hasn't yet responded to that part of Winmill's order. The former governor in a 2016 interview with The Associated Press said he filed the lawsuit because \"we have to know what's going on .\" The Energy Department's \"stonewalling and reluctance lends credence to my suspicion,\" he said. \"That's all I have right now--a strong suspicion backed up by a history of an agency that has run roughshod over the public for way too many years .\" Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill) Published December 01. 2019 5:36 PM Hartford--UConn spends the first hour of every practice working on defense. Nothing else but defense. \"And then we lead to more defense,\" redshirt junior Alterique Gilbert said. \"It's really something that (coach <mark>Dan Hurley</mark>) is emphasizing this year .\" The Huskies are starting to get the desired results from their hard work. An aggressive defense helped turn a tight non-conference game into a runaway, as UConn forced Maine into 28 turnovers on the way to a 64-40 victory before 7,129 fans at the XL Center. It's been 19 years since the Huskies forced that many turnovers, accomplishing the feat against Fairfield. They scored 28 points off the turnovers and also had a season-high 13 steals. \"That's probably the most important thing for us this year is defensive pressure,\" sophomore Brendan Adams said. \"We've got a lot depth so we can run guards and bigs in and out and just keep pressuring the ball .\" Adams and freshman James Bouknight provided a spark off the bench, scoring 11 and a team-best 15 points, respectively. Gilbert (13 points) and junior Tyler Polley (12 points) also hit double figures for the Huskies (5-2). The Huskies entered Sunday's game looking to build on the success that they experienced in the Charleston Classic in South Carolina. Their performance wasn't a thing of beauty, but did the job. They never trailed and led by as many as 24. <mark>Hurley</mark> felt the Huskies didn't take full advantage of their athleticism and edge in talent and depth. They showed signs of immaturity and struggled to finish at the rim, he added. \"I was thrilled with the first two minutes and happier with the last 20...,\" <mark>Hurley</mark> said. \"Coming out of this, we've got to get better offensively. We're not going to be able to out-tough and out-heart the better teams because all the better teams play really hard .\" ...We're not there yet. We've got a lot of work to do. \"Up until UConn's pressure defense changed the game early in the second half, Maine (2-5) controlled the tempo, slowing the action down to a crawl. The Huskies, who shot just 38 percent from the field, needed something to lift them out of an offensive funk. The defense provided the necessary jolt, forcing nine turnovers during a four and a half minute stretch to help ignite a 17-2 spurt that pushed a five-point lead to 20. The Huskies extended their pressure defense and Maine, which was playing without its starting point guard, crumbled. Adams was in the middle of the action. He stole the ball and took off for fast break layup. Then after making a steal, senior Christian Vital fed Adams who rose up a monster dunk over a Maine player for a 42-30 lead .\" That felt great, \"Adams said with a smile. The Huskies kept attacking, building a 52-32 lead with 11:28 left on Jalen Gaffney's steal and transition basket. They cruised to the finish line from there .\" Coach was emphasizing all week that we need to pressure them and pressure them for 40 minutes, \"Vital said .\" If you didn't do that, you were coming out of the game. It's fun as hell to play like that. \"Maine coach <mark>Richard Barron</mark> called UConn's defense elite. The Black Bears shot an icy 35 percent from the field .\" UConn really came out and got in our shorts and made it tough on us, \"<mark>Barron</mark> said. Expect defense to continue to be the backbone for the Huskies this season. They're embracing <mark>Hurley</mark>'s defensive mindset .\" We practiced hard at it and that's what we're definitely going to keep doing all season, \"said Adams who finished with a career-best four steals. <mark>Hurley</mark> has seen improvement in his team's defense since the beginning of the season. But he's far from satisfied .\" We made a big jump just in terms of numbers, \"<mark>Hurley</mark> said .\" Akok (Akok) has helped us so much at that end of the court. Guys are a year more experienced and we emphasize it every day. \"Your only chance to play in any type of significant way in March is if you're a top 50 defensive team. And we're right around that number right now in terms of efficiency. I didn't think we were great today. I thought we had some breakdowns and we'll look at it and get it fixed .\" News and notes The Huskies played without reserve Sidney Wilson, who's sidelined with a knee injury. He may be ready to return for Wednesday's game against Iona in Storrs. \"We got best case scenario news,\" <mark>Hurley</mark> said. \"We're hopeful that he'll be able to do more (Monday).\" ...GIlbert, who entered the game shooting 22 percent, made his first two shots--both three-pointers--and finished 5 for 8 from the field. \"It was just good to see the ball go in,\" said GIlbert, who had 11 points in the first half. g.keefe @ theday.com"}, {"articleID": "2011050617_00022795_W", "names": {"Michael Gould": ["Q6830705", "Q6830706"]}, "date": "2011-05-06", "url": "http://weaselzippers.us/2011/05/06/wiccans-druids-and-%e2%80%9cearth-centered-groups%e2%80%9d-get-their-own-outdoor-chapel-at-air-force-academy/", "content": "report: obama close to signing executive order forcing companies to disclose political donations prior to obtaining contracts? egypt: islamists march in tahrir square protesting killing of osama bin laden? report: obama close to signing executive order forcing companies to disclose political donations prior to obtaining contracts? report: obama close to signing executive order forcing companies to disclose political donations prior to obtaining contracts? egypt: islamists march in tahrir square protesting killing of osama bin laden? video: actress eva longoria discusses her role as obama adviser? wiccans, druids and \"earth-centered groups\" get their own outdoor chapel at air force academy? they still drug test in the military, right?

(coward did star in the original play .) this was a domestic tale of a british family between the wars. <mark>robert newton</mark> and celia johnson star, with especially watchable turns from kay walsh (<mark>lean</mark>), stanley holloway, and <mark>john mills</mark>. the latter had appeared in the stage version, as well as in \"in which we serve .\" he went on to star for <mark>lean</mark> in \"great expectations\" and \"ryan's daughter,\" receiving an oscar for his performance in the latter. during the making of these first two films, coward was raking in the pounds and dollars from his longest-running comedy success, blithe spirit. the 1941 play was simultaneously produced in london (where it opened at the piccadilly in july, for 1,997 performances) and new york (at the morosco in november, for 657). coward appeared in neither, presumably eschewing london so that he could recreate his direction in new york. he did, though, play the role in the u.k. tour which opened just after the 1942 release of \"in which we serve .\" blithe spirit brought enormous cheer to war-weary audiences, with the coward stand-in originated by cecil parker in london and rex harrison took the lead, supported by kay hammond (elvira) and margaret rutherford (madame arcati) from the west end company, along with constance cummings as ruth. <mark>david lean</mark>'s film of \"blithe spirit\" - produced by coward - remains a delightfully whimsical joy. the prize of the set, naturally enough, is \"brief encounter .\" here we have celia johnson (once again) and trevor howard in that railway station refreshment room, as rachmaninoff's second piano concerto swells on the soundtrack. \"brief encounter\" was derived from still life, one of the short plays that encompassed coward's 1936 tour-de-force tonight at 8:30.

(reuters) may 12, 2012: mitt romney speaks at the liberty university commencement ceremony in lynchburg, va. reuters next slide previous slide nearly one year ago i ignited a national discussion about mitt romney's religious faith by labeling mormonism as a \"cult .\" although i readily acknowledged that romney's mormonism did not disqualify him from the presidency (and that i would prefer him to president obama), i did predict that if romney became the republican nominee, president obama would win a second term. i'm now willing to admit my prognostication may have been premature for several reasons. i had based my prediction of romney's defeat on the belief that enough evangelicals would stay at home in november due to a lack of enthusiasm for a romney presidency. some evangelical christians have been troubled by romney's mormonism, while others are disturbed by his lack of a consistent, conservative record on social issues. since evangelicals historically have voted overwhelmingly for republicans, it would not take many evangelicals sitting out this election to ensure an obama victory. for example, in 2004 george w. bush garnered 79 percent of the evangelical vote and won a second term; yet, in 2008 john mccain captured 73 percent of the evangelical vote and lost to barack obama. i had no reason to think that evangelicals would be any more enthused about mitt romney than they were about john mccain. but over the last 11 months three developments have changed my mind about romney's appeal to evangelical voters. first, many evangelical christians are incensed by the obama administration's relentless assaults on religious freedom. in october of 2011, the obama justice department argued before the supreme court in the case of hosanna-tabor evangelical lutheran church and school v. eeoc that the ministerial exemption to federal hiring standards should be rescinded. the revocation of that exemption would mean that churches could be forced to violate their doctrinal beliefs and hire homosexuals as pastors or women as priests. an astonished supreme court asked the obama representative if the federal government should have jurisdiction over whom a church hired as its minister and the representative said \"yes .\" fortunately, the supreme court unanimously rejected that claim. yet, the fact that the obama administration would state such a position should be chilling to people of any faith. i had no reason to think that evangelicals would be any more enthused about mitt romney than they were about john mccain. but over the last 11 months three developments have changed my mind about romney's appeal to evangelical voters. - evangelicals were similarly angered in january, 2012 by the mandate issued by u.s. department of health and human services requiring organizations to provide contraceptives, sterilization services, and abortion-inducing drugs to its employees. although there was a narrow religious exemption to this order, religious charities and hospitals were required to violate their beliefs and offer these \"benefits .\" in a demonstration of spiritual solidarity, evangelicals and catholics joined together to protest this outrageous example of governmental overreach into religious institutions. to date, there has been no satisfactory resolution of this crisis and both pastors and priests have said they would choose prison over compliance with obama's edict. a second milestone development this past year was president obama's public approval of homosexual marriage in may of 2012 which has both energized efforts of evangelical republicans and at the same time diminished his support among evangelical democrats (primarily hispanics and african-americans). one does not have to be a homophobe to understand that it is impossible to reconcile homosexual marriage with the teaching of jesus christ who described god's design for marriage as one man and one woman in a lifetime relationship (matthew 19:4 -6). any deviation from that standard-adultery, polygamy, pre-marital sex, or homosexuality-is a sin according traditional christian and jewish teaching. beyond the theological objection to homosexual marriage, evangelicals see a flood of societal problems that will be unleashed on a country that attempts to redefine marriage. numerous studies have demonstrated that depression, incarceration, and even suicide are more prevalent among children who are not reared by their biological father and mother. princeton university sociologist sara mclanahan and others have noted that the ideal situation for a child is to be in a family with both biological parents. that reality may have been the impetus for cardinal timothy dolan's benediction at the democratic national convention (which had just adopted a platform supporting homosexual marriage .) \"empower us with your grace, so that we might resist the temptation to replace the moral law with idols of our own making, or to remake those institutions you have given us for the nurturing of life and community .\" president obama's support of homosexual marriage is not only igniting support among evangelical republicans but will also suppress voter turnout among evangelical african-americans and hispanics. i have a number of minorities in my church who voted for president obama in 2008 but are finding it difficult to support him in 2012 because they cannot reconcile his stance on homosexual marriage with their christian faith. they are insulted by those who would compare the fight for \"marriage equality\" with their centuries-long struggle for civil rights. as one african-american clergyman in our area said, \"don't equate sin with the color of my skin!\" these evangelical christian minorities are not going to suddenly transform into republican supporters of mitt romney. they will simply sit out this election which in a close election could be enough to deny president obama a second term. finally, romney's selection of <mark>paul ryan</mark> as his running mate sent a strong signal to evangelicals that they would have someone in the white house who represents their values. had romney picked a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate like former secretary of state condoleezza rice or new jersey governor chris christie, it would have only confirmed many evangelicals' suspicion about romney-that his conversion to conservatism was a matter of convenience rather than conviction. however, <mark>paul ryan</mark>'s strong pro-life record and unapologetic support for traditional marriage have assured evangelicals that when it comes time to nominate the next supreme court justice there will be someone at the table who represents their values. i don't pretend to know whether mitt romney will win on november 6. however, i am certain that president obama's hard turn to the left and romney's selection of <mark>paul ryan</mark> have made mitt romney much more palatable to evangelical christians-like me. dr. robert jeffress is pastor of the 11,000-member first baptist church in dallas, texas and hosts a daily radio program heard on 722 stations nationwide. print email share comments recommend tweet related video mitt romney responds to \"secret video' on neil cavuto related stories could religion tip the election? poll: qualms about mormonism widespread, but may not impact romney's run for the presidency"}]
