Friday's World Cup quarterfinal between France and Germany is a repeat of one of the most iconic and dramatic games in World Cup history: the 1982 World Cup semifinal, notable for German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher's horrific challenge on Patrick Battiston, which left the French substitute unconscious, with two teeth knocked out and three cracked ribs. Schumacher was not booked and referee Charles Corver did not even award a foul ., Ben Lyttleton details how each of the key players in that game saw the Schumacher/Battiston episode, and how it affected their mindset going into the shootout. In this excerpt, he explains what happened after the final whistle. The game had finished at 23:41 local time, which goes some way to explaining why the Schumacher incident barely registered in the next day's analysis. \"Fabuleux!\" ran L'Equipe's headline, praising the France team for its attacking verve and coach Michel Hidalgo for fielding three playmakers in Alain Giresse, Michel Platini, and Bernard Genghini. \"One day later, the mood changed as the severity of Schumacher's challenge took top billing .\" Red-handed! \"was L'Equipe's front page, with an image of Schumacher's hip making contact with Battiston's jaw .\" A story of unpunished violence ....Schumacher was a brute. It's a morality tale which we will tell our children. \"Hidalgo changed his tone from valiant loser to angry victim .\" You say Corver is an international referee? I have my doubts, if he risks the safety of the players like that. \"L'Equipe's switchboard was jammed with anti-German calls and cars with German number-plates parked in French campsites had tires slashed and windows broken. To improve relations, Chancellor <mark>Helmut Schmidt</mark> sent an open letter of condolence to President Francois Mitterand .\" Our hearts go out to the French, who deserved to go through just as much as the Germans. \"French defender Patrick Battiston lies on the ground while waiting for the medical staff to come during the 1982 World Cup semifinal soccer match between West Germany and France. After Italy had beaten West Germany in the final -\" Justice! \"crowed L'Equipe - someone had the bright idea to send Schumacher on a diplomatic mission to France to apologize in person. Schumacher travelled to Metz on the day before Battiston's wedding and presented him with an FC K\u00f6ln pennant and an apology. But the trip was not a success .\" Schumacher forgets himself, \"said German magazine Kicker .\" It was a gesture of reconciliation with unpleasant consequences. \"The pair were photographed sitting next to each other at a hastily arranged press conference, looking in opposite directions. Schumacher, objecting to questions from the French press, cut the conference short .\" This is something that concerns only Battiston and me, \"he said .\" If I had known, I would have brought my own German journalists with me. \"The peace offering had turned ugly .\" The bad guy just wanted to poke fun at the good guy, \"wrote One day after the failed reconciliation, Mitterand considered asking Hidalgo to get his players to state publicly that they had no problem with Schumacher. Hidalgo had his response ready:\" What, shall I ask them to take the Germans on holiday with them? \"That gave France Football magazine an idea: It asked the France team where they would take Schumacher on holiday. Here are the answers: Platini: To climb the Grandes Jorasses mountains [in Mont Blanc]. Maxime Bossis: To scale the heights of the Vall\u00e9e Blanche [in Mont Blanc]. Dominique Rocheteau: To watch a sunset from the cliffs of \u00e9tretat. Marius Tr\u00e9sor: To do a parachute jump with a delayed opening. Battiston: To help me pick mushrooms in the forest as I still can't bend down. It does not take a mastermind of psychology to spot the common theme. Platini, the French captain, believes that France needed to lose this game-which in French folklore is simply referred to as Sevilla 82-to help them win their first competitive trophy, the European Championship, two years later .\" The legend of this game comes from the fact that we lost it, \"said Platini .\" In losing it, we became a great team. It was the end, but also the beginning of something. In the history of French football, the two turning points were Sevilla 82 and the 1998 World Cup final. Sevilla marked a generation of football fans, gave them a collective state of mind: it's why books and plays have been written about the game. No movie in the world could have provided as much conflicting emotion as Sevila 82. It's certainly a beautiful moment in my career. It's the moment that makes you say afterwards, \"I'm glad I was there!' Even if you lose .\" The heroic failure inspired creativity. France's 1982 defeat indeed spawned books, documentaries, plays and music, all created by a generation for whom the game was a defining moment. In 2006, scenic-representation artist Massimo Furlan pretended to be Platini in his performance Number 10, in which he mimed the France midfielder's pass to Battiston, reaction to his injury, and his penalty kick, in an empty stadium save for one observer: the coach Hidalgo, watching from the sideline. Red, a French musician, played a concert he called Sevilla 82 against a visual backdrop of the game. France-Allemagne was a play examining the relationship between the two countries, set in a Frenchman's living room as he entertains a German guest with the game on in the background. French choreographer <mark>Pierre Rigal</mark>, who was nine in 1982, produced a dance piece, Injury Time, which he took to Potsdam in Germany. \"I remember it as a great injustice and frustration, an event that went beyond sport,\" he said, \"and my piece was a way of looking at how we treat childhood memories .\" Twenty-seven years after the game, totally out of the blue, Battiston received a package from his old teammate Platini. It was his full kit from the game-blue shirt, white shorts with the distinctive circled number three, and red socks-which had been left in the dressing room, kept in a Seville museum, and then presented to Platini on one of his UEFA presidential trips. Battiston was emotional when he opened it; the kit now hangs in his son's bedroom. Schumacher also gave Battiston his goalkeeping jersey before a friendly between the two sides in Strasbourg in April 1984. Battiston has no idea where it is now, or even if he still has it. by Ben Lyttleton, out now from Bantam Press. 1.

We got our hands on Empire of Sin at Gamescom and our impression at the time was the gangster-filled strategy title had a lot of promise but needed polish and bit more variety.

However, in 2011 the Minister of State's title was - Minister of State at the Department of Health with Special Responsibility for Disability, Older People, Equality & Mental Health. Minister <mark>Lynch</mark> has released a statement this evening saying that she \"retains responsibility under the Social Care element of her portfolio for Mental Health, Disability and Older People\". Concerns The charity for older people, Alone, said it is \"extremely concerned' about the change of title. CEO Sean Moynihan said,\" The removal of \"older people' from the Ministerial title strongly suggests a shift in priorities within the current Government. The number of people over the age of 65 is increasing by 20,000 a year. Monihan added,\" in such a climate the government should be prioritising the needs of older people and strategically planning for the future instead of removing them from sight. \"After seeing what my dad has gone through, I'm convinced we need an Ombudsman for the Elderly> Please select the reason for reporting this comment.

Simon Pagenaud breezed past him high on the restart, triggering a dramatic duel that included five passes in the closing 13 laps. Rossi twice regained the lead, but it was Pagenaud who made the decisive pass, taking the lead heading to the white flag and then holding on through the final lap. It gave Team Penske another win at the Brickyard. And it left Rossi ruing a chance that got away. \"I'm happy to get a result,\" he said, \"but unfortunately nothing else matters here but winning. This one will be hard to get over, but at the end of the day, it's a great showing .\" Rossi said the difference was simple: \"Horsepower .\" All month long, the Chevrolet-powered cars appeared to have an advantage over Honda, particularly when it came to straight-line speed. Honda appeared to have an advantage in fuel mileage, but a late wreck that red-flagged the race wound up making that a moot point. Speed was all that mattered. Pagenaud in his Chevrolet had just a bit more. \"There's not much I can do about that inside the car,\" said Rossi, who won the 2016 race in his first try, and has finished seventh or better in all four starts. \"That last yellow hurt us. We were doing a lot better on fuel mileage than he was. It was the first kind of nail in the proverbial coffin. And the second was I just didn't have the speed out front .\" Rossi acknowledged it was \"a good day for the team,\" but a number of incidents hurt the chances of a car he said was \"by far the best in the field .\" The first came on a pit stop midway through the race, when an issue with a component inside the fueling mechanism caused a problem. While a crew member frantically kept trying to get the gas to flow, Rossi began pounding his steering wheel in frustration for a stop that took more than 20 seconds. It only cost Rossi a handful of spots, thanks to a timely yellow flag. \"It wasn't ideal, for sure,\" said Rossi's race strategist, <mark>Rob Edwards</mark>. The second incident involved Oriol Servia, who was a lap down but found himself jockeying with the leaders with about 50 laps to go. Rossi kept trying to get around him, and at one point got pinched and nearly hit the wall while trying to make a pass, leaving him to ask: \"What is he doing!?\" Rossi finally got around Servia while gesturing wildly from his cockpit at about 230 mph. \"There was a lot of lapped cars and no respect for what we were doing,\" Rossi said. \"It was really unfortunate. Ultimately it didn't make a difference with the result .\" Not with the way Pagenaud was driving down the stretch. He took the lead on Rossi during the restart with 13 laps to go, then gave it up on the next lap, only to regain it once more. Pagenaud patiently waited for the penultimate lap, then swept through Turn 3 to retake the lead as the two of them barreled toward the white flag. Rossi sucked up to his Team Penske rival on the back stretch, but Pagenaud slithered like a snake to keep him behind. Pagenaud then dived low as they exited the final corner, and the break in the draft created enough separation that Rossi was never able to make a finish-line pass. Rossi said that Pagenaud was \"moving in reaction, for sure,\" but he never thought about lodging a protest over the blocking. \"The last lap of the Indy 500,\" he said, \"they're not going to do anything .\" Instead, Rossi tried to turn his anger into a sense of accomplishment. \"This one will be hard to get over, but at the end of the day, it's a great showing,\" he said. \"We have to take the positives from this and the positives are the 27 boys did a phenomenal job .\" ___ More AP auto racing: https: //apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https: //twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

While <mark>Chris</mark> wasn't the only person in their 50s to take on the capital challenge, his wife Linda said it was especially impressive as he has never been sporty. The massive fundraising feat was also particularly important to <mark>Chris</mark> as it was a cause close to his heart. Linda <mark>Russell</mark> said:\" He has been raising money for the Round Table Children's Wish. \"He was an Ilminster Round Tabler for many years, until he became too old, and now he is a member of the Yeovil 41 club which is the follow on from Round Table .\" The charity has granted wishes - bespoke wishes - to children with life threatening illnesses. \"This is particularly special for us as our nephew suffered with a life threatening illness .\" He has raised \u00a3 3,500, and is even touching on \u00a3 4,000. \"<mark>Chris</mark> only started running a couple of years ago. He completed the Yeovil Half Marathon last year, and then ran it again in 2019 as a warm up for the Virgin London Marathon. <mark>Chris</mark> said:\" I watched my son, Tom, run the 2017 Yeovil Half Marathon and thought \"I would like to do that' .\" But I have never been a runner, so I started training and I managed to do the 2018 Yeovil Half. \"Since then I haven't stopped running and set myself the massive personal challenge of running the 2019 London Marathon .\" I have never been particularly sporty, and the Yeovil Half was the furthest distance I had run in my life. \"To make this more than a huge achievement for myself, I have decided to run for a charity that is close to my family's heart--The Round Table Children's Wish, which is a registered charity dedicated to granting handcrafted wishes for children and young people with life threatening illnesses .\" More than 444,000 applied in the ballot for a place, with 56,398 successful applicants.

"content": "stead move: nothing personal - roy carl marston last updated: 16/02/2010 07:00:00 leading scorer jon stead may have left portman road, but ipswich town boss roy keane has no plans to bring in a replacement. stead's on-off loan move to coventry city was finally rubber-stamped yesterday afternoon, with the 26-year-old target man signing a deal to the end of the season, with a view to a permanent contract in the summer. the arrival of fellow strikers daryl murphy and <mark>david healy</mark>, on loan from sunderland at the start of the month, had lessened stead's chances of making the starting line-up. but although the ex-blackburn, sheffield united and sunderland striker was desperate for some regular first team football, he still took time to weigh up all his options before agreeing to join coventry, because of personal reasons. the fact that stead's wife is heavily pregnant, and that the couple are well settled in suffolk, made it a difficult decision. keane explained: \"when i put these opportunities to players, it's up to the player, just like it was with <mark>alex bruce</mark> (to leicester) a few weeks ago .\" it's nothing personal, it's just if a player wants a guaranteed run of games, that i can't give them, and if the deal is right for the club, then we'll put it to the player. it's no big issue. \"it happens with players. some see it as an opportunity to play a few games, others will want to stay and fight for their place. players are in control of it,\" added keane. stead actually trained with town on sunday, and even yesterday morning keane was still planning to put stead in his squad for tonight's game at peterborough united. however stead, with six goals to his name this season, travelled up to the ricoh arena yesterday afternoon to discuss terms. he will put pen to paper this morning. coventry boss <mark>chris coleman</mark> said: \"he has all the attributes to be a very good player for coventry .\" keane remains happy with his strike-force department, which also includes pablo counago, connor wickham and the versatile jon walters, in addition to murphy and <mark>healy</mark>. \"we've got a lot of strikers, particularly with the two new boys coming in,\" confirmed keane. \"i wouldn't think we'd need another striker. i didn't bring the two lads in to sit on the bench. they are here to play games .\" we're not too bad in terms of numbers, \"concluded keane."}, {"articleID": "2012042004_00061637_W", "names": {"Lewis Hamilton": ["Q6536656", "Q9673"], "George Galloway": ["Q332483", "Q42322064", "Q5539601"]}, "date":

the bahrain grand prix to be cancelled as the gulf state braces itself for further violent demonstrations following months of political unrest. yvette cooper said british formula one stars jenson button and <mark>lewis hamilton</mark> should not take part in the controversial three-day event, which is expected to be beset by a wave of protests from pro-democracy campaigners when it begins today. speaking on bbc's question time, she said: \"it shouldn't go ahead, i don't think british drivers should go, i think the formula one should not go ahead in bahrain .\" you have got demonstrations by democratic protesters who have been violently suppressed and although it should be a matter for the sport to decide rather than for the government, i do think government ministers can express an opinion. that opinion should be it should not go ahead, it would sent the wrong signal, it should not happen. \"ms cooper joins a growing number of politicians and human rights campaigners who have called on organisers to pull the plug on the event because of the regime's crackdown on demonstrators. respect mp <mark>george galloway</mark> said the tracks of the middle eastern race circuit were\" stained by the blood of the people who are asking for a vote \". he said:\" there is blood on the tracks and anyone who drives over then will never be forgiven. \"earlier this week shadow foreign secretary douglas alexander also said proceeding would\" send the wrong signal \", while amnesty international said human rights violations are continuing in the gulf kingdom despite government promises that the country is on the road to reform. in a recent report, the campaign group said security forces were still using excessive and unnecessary force against anti-government protesters. the charity also said it was receiving ongoing reports of the torture and ill-treatment of demonstrators, who have been involved in ongoing clashes with police. the 2011 race was cancelled as international criticism grew over the bloodshed, but despite calls for f1 chief bernie ecclestone to scrap this year's event it looks certain to go ahead. security around the event has has been significantly ramped up with the main race taking place on sunday. british f1 star jenson button refused to become embroiled in the issue. when asked about the situation, the mclaren driver said:\" you are here interviewing me as a driver and that's exactly what i am going to talk about - motor racing. the outside issues, i'm not going to talk about.

there' judah friedlander, comic crusader although tina fey and alec baldwin take centre stage in the nbc comedy 30 rock, the snl-spoofing sitcom has plenty of secret weapons hidden in its comedy-ringer cast. as the slovenly writer frank rossitano, judah friedlander is one of those aforementioned assets - a stand-up comic by trade who pops into frame every so often with a quick zinger, only to exit stage right immediately after. when he's not upstaging fey or the show's more bombastic headliner, <mark>tracy morgan</mark>, friedlander is busy teaching comedy club audiences how best to defend themselves from such everyday villains as ninjas, three-armed bandits and, of course, bigfoot. the self-proclaimed\" world champion \"has compiled his ultimate fighting strategies in a new deliberately over-the-top comedy book, how to beat up anybody: an instructional and inspirational karate book .\" straight up, i just wanted to keep america safe and keep the world safe, \"says a typically deadpan friedlander over the phone from new york .\" as the world's best athlete, i thought it was important to know what's going on in certain areas, from ninja home invasions to bigfoot attacks .? plus, with deforestation going on, bigfoots are being forced out of their homes and are entering human communities. i'm the only person talking about it. \"while the 200-odd-page book was originally intended as a spinoff of friedlander's alternative stand-up act, the comic says most of the material is fresh, including about 500 photos .\" it's not just a book repeating my act - stand-up is no. 1 for me, but there's only like two jokes from my act that made it in [the book]. i started working on it about seven years ago, and it's all new material, \"says friedlander, who will be in toronto on monday to promote the book (and possibly fit in a surprise stand-up performance). as for his side gig on 30 rock, friedlander isn't too worried about balancing prime-time comedy with karate .\" it's tough to balance it all. it's kind of like having three jobs non-stop, but the main focus was always the book, \"he says .\" it's for the whole world, not just americans .? let's face it, canada may be doing better than the u.s., but when the economy goes down anywhere, crime goes up, and that's when you need to know how to defend yourselves. \"hear ye! our latest selection in the
