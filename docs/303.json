According to city campaign finance records, Arthur Dantchik, Joel Greenberg and Jeff Yass--heads of the trading firm Susquehanna International Group--have pumped almost $7 million into the American Cities super PAC, which backs state Sen. Anthony H. Williams (D). The total contributed by the three financial executives through May 4, the cutoff for the latest reports, not only dwarfs the amount spent by each candidate in the race, but also is nearly equal to all candidate and other super PAC fundraising combined. The contributions come amid a continued uptick in large campaign donations from financial investors to city, state and municipal elections sent through super PACs in recent years. The funds are largely given in support of market-based education reforms including the privatization of public schools, the diversion of public school funds to charter schools and the breaking of teachers unions .\" There is a trend right now toward increased outside spending on lower-ticket races, \"said Denise Roth Barber, managing director at the National Institute on Money in State Politics, a group tracking campaign finance at the state level. The $7 million contributed by just three individuals in the Philadelphia mayoral race stands out as one of the largest financial investments at the city level since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling opened the door for unlimited independent spending by corporations, unions and, ultimately, wealthy individuals. A super PAC that was largely funded by supporters of charter schools and school privatization spent $4 million in support of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's winning re-election campaign this year. A hedge-fund-backed group in New York that successfully helped elect a Republican state Senate majority in 2014 also spent $4 million. And in Newark's 2014 mayoral election, supporters of market education reform similarly spent $4 million in a losing campaign to elect a successor to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The Susquehanna International Group investors are major backers of these policies through their political and charitable donations, and as a staunch supporter of these types of policies, <mark>Williams</mark> is a perfect fit with these priorities. In the state Senate, <mark>Williams</mark> was the architect of an expansion of the state tax credit diverting public funds to charter schools by allowing corporations and wealthy individuals to be refunded with public money when they pay for a scholarship, or\" voucher, \"for a public school student to attend a charter school. He also served on the education commission created by former Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, a proponent of charter schools and vouchers. <mark>Williams</mark> is not a new commodity for the investors based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass spent at least $6 million through their Students First PA PAC to support <mark>Williams</mark>' bid for the Democratic Party's gubernatorial nomination in 2010. Susquehanna International Group did not respond to a request for comment from Dantchik, Greenberg, Yass or the company itself. Barbara Grant, a spokeswoman for the <mark>Williams</mark> campaign, said she could not comment on the prior connections between the campaign and the American Cities PAC donors, citing the ban on coordination between campaigns and super PACs .\" I can tell you what the senator has said for a very long time about his being influenced by the gentlemen who are the founders [of American Cities PAC], \"Grant said .\" And basically, he's said they have supported him for a long time and they've never asked him for anything except to advance the cause of good schools and good education for kids. \"Connections between <mark>Williams</mark> and the Susquehanna International Group donors are not limited to their contributions. <mark>Williams</mark>' campaign manager, Dawn Chavous, Chavous also founded a charity, Sky Community Partners, to take advantage of the tax credits for scholarships policy pushed by <mark>Williams</mark>. The Susquehanna International Group investors have given money to Sky Community Partners in exchange for tax credits under the program. Actually, Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass are, collectively, the largest users of the tax credit program. Not only do they give to Sky Community Partners, but they have also donated to Choice Academics, a charter charity run by Yass' wife, Janine. The tax credit program, which cost the state $127 million in 2014, has been plagued by a lack of oversight and criticized by Gov. <mark>Tom Wolf</mark> (D). According to a report on Philly.com, the state's Department of Community and Economic Development\" acknowledged that until 2012, it did not keep digital records for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of educational tax-credit applications filed on paper. \"The program also contains a loophole, according to Philly.com, allowing companies to sidestep the limit in the total amount of tax credits they can receive under the program in a given year by donating through affiliates or subsidiaries. This is precisely the practice used by the Susquehanna International Group. While Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass have a long history of supporting <mark>Williams</mark> in Democratic primary elections and have made bipartisan contributions for years, they are primarily backers of Republican Party politicians and groups promoting libertarian policies. They have contributed to national Republican Party committees, Corbett, Wisconsin Gov. <mark>Scott Walker</mark> (R) and Republican leaders such as former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va .). Large contributions have flowed to various committees set up by the Club for Growth. Most of the candidates they supported in recent elections are from the more libertarian wing of the party or the tea party. Yass contributed to the 2000 presidential campaign of Libertarian Party nominee Harry Browne and the Libertarian National Committee and also the Ralph Nader's 2004 independent presidential campaign. The trio has also donated to Democrats, including both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential nominating contest and Pennsylvania politicians such as then-Gov. Ed Rendell and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey. Democratic congressmen on key financial services committees have also received contributions. Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass have given contributions to Democratic Party committees as well, albeit on a smaller scale than to Republican groups. The three investors have also given millions of dollars to such nonprofits as the libertarian Cato Institute, the libertarian legal group Institute for Justice and the Ayn Rand Institute .\" They know they can't elect a Republican citywide in Philadelphia, and <mark>Tony Williams</mark> is the closest thing they can get, \"said Kati Sipp, director of Pennsylvania Working Families, a group backing <mark>Williams</mark>' opponent Jim Kenney in the mayoral race. Previous polling, both independent and by groups favoring individual candidates, showed a tight race between Kenney and <mark>Williams</mark>. An NBC 10 poll released on Thursday, however, gave Kenney a large lead and <mark>Williams</mark> in a tie for second with former District Attorney Lynne Abraham. Kenney has the backing of many of the city's largest unions including the teachers unions and national unions like the AFL-CIO, and those groups have contributed large sums to super PACs supporting his election, but not nearly to the level of the Susquehanna International Group. The union-supported Building a Better PA super PAC raised $1.5 million through May 4. Another pro-Kenney union group, Forward Philadelphia, raised $783,100 through the same date. Spending by all super PACs is expected to pick up in the final week of the campaign.

Sean Dillon in action for Dundee United DUNDEE UNITED captain Sean Dillon has signed a new deal with Jackie McNamara's side that will see him remain at Tannadice until May 2017. The 31-year-old defender - who has made 293 appearances since signing in January 2007, has agreed a two-year extension to add to the eight years he has already spent on Tayside. Manager McNamara was delighted to secure Dillon on a new deal and told United's official website:\" I am happy to secure Sean for a further two seasons. He is immensely valuable to the club both on and off the field. \"On field, Sean has a versatility which means I can call on him to cover a number of positions and in the dressing room and as an ambassador for the club he is the model professional and the ideal role model for our younger players. Sean Dillon is delighted to have committed to Dundee United for a further two years\" It is very rare in today's football world that a player commits ten years to one club and by signing this contract, Sean has ensured he will be a United player for that length of time. \"His commitment to Dundee United is amazing and I believe he will continue to prove a valuable part of the squad for the foreseeable future .\" Dillon was ecstatic to have his future at Tannadice secured and said: \"I love playing for Dundee United .\" This Club is obviously a massive part of my life and the Dundee area is my family home.

Vey, a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program fellow and Baltimore resident, shared her personal response to the death of Freddie Gray and subsequent riots while introducing a recent Brookings panel focused on creating more opportunities for young people and families in distressed communities and the role of place in poverty. Though the events in Baltimore served as the backdrop for a discussion among experts from the nonprofit, community development and public policy sectors, Vey reminded the audience that the challenges faced by her city \"are far from unique\" and that the difficult lessons learned and paths forward following its recent challenges can be applied to struggling urban areas nationwide. Remember that \"it takes a village\" Amy Liu, co-director of the Metropolitan Policy Program, echoed Vey's point, noting that there's currently a broad, national discussion taking place about poverty. (Including a In order to sustain this national conversation and identify real solutions, Liu stressed the importance of convening leaders and organizations who have been on the front lines of these issues. As she put it, \"to convert neighborhoods of poverty to neighborhoods of opportunity, it takes a village. And we've brought a mini village in today .\" Ensure that redevelopment is linked to employment opportunities Part of that village included Bart Harvey who, like Vey, calls Baltimore home. As former CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit focused on developing public-private partnerships to create affordable housing, Harvey helped families purchase about 400 homes in Freddie Gray's neighborhood, Sandtown-Winchester, 20 years earlier. When Harvey returned to the neighborhood a day after the riots, what he witnessed, he said, \"was very different than what you might have expected .\" \"Being a Baltimorean I was [initially] heartbroken, but when I went and toured all of the investments Enterprise had made, and they looked better than they did 20 years ago when we built there. Homeowners were there, and there was a beating heart at the center of Winchester. That was very positive and reassuring .\" If the investments made by Harvey's organization in housing were (and remain) successful, then what went wrong? Harvey said that a lack of economic growth in the area-and associated jobs-are likely to blame. \"There wasn't an economic driver that kept that redevelopment going past where the homeowners and stability were in Sandtown-Winchester. The employment didn't occur .\" The key, Harvey says, to sustaining growth in neighborhoods like Sandtown-Winchester is working to ensure that once housing investments are made, \"economic development and employment follow .\" Plan for change Donald Hinkle-Brown, CEO of The Reinvestment Fund, agreed with Harvey, and attributed careful economic planning to his organization's success in revitalizing other low-income Baltimore neighborhoods. Hinkle-Brown noted that after initiating prudently planned, data-driven building and investment projects, the private market has followed suit. \"The private market is drafting on our wind, and that is what makes it manageable in terms of public subsidies in today's environment of shrinking budgets,\" said Hinkle-Brown. But he was careful to distinguish his organization's work from traditional gentrification, reminding the audience that \"this is planned change. What we're trying to do is manage a joint effort [between public and private sectors] to build value and opportunity for existing residents and new residents in a way that's managed and self-sustaining .\" Focus on more doing and less planning Derek Douglas, vice president for civic engagement at the University of Chicago and former member of the White House Domestic Policy Council, joined the conversation with a unique perspective from both his past policy work and his current role as a representative of the largest economic driver on Chicago's South Side. Douglas's advice for moving the needle in our nation's most troubled urban areas: More doing, less planning. As he put it: \"If you go into these communities they'll have 50 plans, and every year some new group is coming to do a plan. And they feel that they're essentially planned all the time, with nothing ever actually happening .\" This phenomenon, Douglas said, \"is actually a negative for a community .\" In his role at the University of Chicago Douglas has put this advice into practice by helping fully implement civic engagement programs, like UChicago's Urban Labs, that leverage the university's offerings throughout South Side communities. Involve young people in improvement projects Joel Miranda, director of leadership development and graduate leadership at YouthBuild USA, a nonprofit that provides support for unemployed young Americans, says many of the solutions we seek for improving struggling communities can come from the very group that is often blamed for a variety of issues in these areas: local youth. \"If you simply stop and ask a young person what they'd like to do their community, they'll have lots of great ideas,\" said Miranda. Moreover, once some of those ideas are put into place, Miranda says young people are more likely to feel a connection to and invest in the well-being of their communities. \"Once young people are building community assets, they remember that for a lifetime. They drive past that house, that building that they helped build, and they say' I built that, and therefore I am taking care of care of that .'\" When it comes to funding projects, \"un-crowd the field\" and \"bet on winners\" When it comes to successful grant giving, <mark>Michael Smith</mark>, special assistant to President Obama and senior director of cabinet affairs for My Brother's Keeper stressed the importance of funding the right, data-driven organizations. \"As obsessed as we are in American with data...our FitBits, our Apple watches, our Trip Advisor and our Yelp, when it comes to organizations that are supposed to be [our] springboards and safety nets, we throw that all out the window .\" Rather than continuing to invest in organizations \"because our grandparents invested in them, or because it has a friendly member in the legislature,\" he argued that in our current economy, the impetus is on funders to recognize \"that good is not good enough\" and to \"stop investing in organizations that are counting how many kids went through, and not counting real, meaningful impact .\" ", "articleID": "2015052418_00017282_W", "names": {"Michael Smith": ["Q15637781", "Q1620255", "Q16207164", "Q16225563", "Q1627389", "Q16976514", "Q1720858", "Q18325554", "Q18325556", "Q18344457", "Q1929419", "Q1982423", "Q21175251", "Q3856267", "Q52907019", "Q56394971", "Q58870848", "Q6829665", "Q6831697", "Q6834460", "Q6834463", "Q6834464", "Q6834465", "Q6834468", "Q6834469", "Q6834471", "Q6834472", "Q6834473", "Q6834474", "Q6834475", "Q6834476", "Q6834478", "Q6834480"]}}]
