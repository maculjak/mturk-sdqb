But aside from their wild fashion choices, many people also wear showstopping makeup and hair looks to the event. On Monday, a number of stars attended the 2019 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art wearing everything from false eyelashes to bright eye makeup in an attempt to match the event's theme of \"Camp: Notes on Fashion .\" Below, take a look at some of the best - and wildest - looks worn to this year's gala. 2/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Lady Gaga arrived wearing long eyelashes and fake tears. She also matched her lips to her ensemble with Barbie-pink lipstick, and donned a short blonde hairstyle. 3/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Laverne Cox used her makeup to add pops of color to her black ensemble. The actress wore blue eye shadow, purple lipstick, and a light-blue hairstyle. 4/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images <mark>Ashley Graham</mark> added pearls and a bow to her ponytail for a touch of glam. The model also accessorized with Gucci hair clips, green eyeliner, and bright highlighter. 5/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo Regina Hall dazzled with gems across her eyelids. Her look was completed with bold eye shadow and pink hair. 6/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Sara Sampaio's eyelashes feathered out at the corners. The model looked fierce, especially thanks to her smoky eye makeup. 7/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Awkwafina matched her eye shadow to her dress. For her first Met Gala appearance, the actress wore gold glitter across her eyelids, and glossy red lipstick. 8/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Charli XCX contrasted her yellow dress with a pink-and-red beauty look. As she walked the red carpet, the musician showed off her bright-pink eye shadow, and brown hair with red tips. 9/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Mindy Kaling ditched her usually dark hair for a lighter shade. Kaling's blonde hairstyle perfectly complimented her gold dress. 10/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Billy Porter stunned with his golden makeup. His eyelids and eyebrows were entirely covered with sparkles, small pearls, and jewels. He also wore berry-colored lipstick with a gold streak down the middle. 11/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Aquaria donned a bold white hairstyle and equally daring makeup. Her hairstyle appears to have been slicked down with white paint, while her eye makeup looked geometric. 12/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Natasha Lyonne went for a smoky eye look. She also wore her hair in a curled style that sat right above the wings of her suit. 13/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Darren Criss made a case for blue eye shadow at the 2019 Met Gala. Like Billy Porter, Criss also drew a line down the center of his lips, though in red. 14/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Madelaine Petsch experimented with bangs on the red carpet. Her pink eye shadow perfectly complimented her turquoise gown. 15/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Lucy Boynton also mixed shades of blue and pink. The actress wore a blue hairstyle to the Met Gala, as well as silver lines surrounding her eyes. 16/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Constance Wu opted for a dark version of a 1920s beauty look. She wore dark lipstick, as well as a short and curled hairstyle. 17/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Alessia Cara had black dots drawn across her eyes. The musician paired winged eyeliner with six black circles across her face. 18/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Mike Coppola/MG19/Getty Images Elle Fanning looked like she stepped out of another decade with her half-up half-down hairstyle. She paired the look with blue winged eyeliner, and shiny pink lipstick. 19/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Charles Sykes/Invision/AP Kacey Musgraves channeled Barbie in a blonde wig. And to match her outfit, the musician wore simple eye makeup and a bold pink lip color. 20/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Gigi Hadid had some of the longest eyelashes on the red carpet. The model's eyelashes were a stark white color, while the rest of her face was almost bare. 21/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Mike Coppola/MG19/Getty Images Dua Lipa wore jeweled barrettes in her hair. Her usually short hair was transformed into a long style with a beehive shape. 22/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Lily Collins wore a similar hairstyle. But rather than wearing jewel hair clips, the actress wore a white headband and flower clips. She also donned purple eye shadow. 23/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Mike Coppola/MG19/Getty Images Hailey Steinfeld opted for a curled hairstyle with a large bow on top. For her makeup, the star chose green eye shadow, pink lipstick, and matching blush. 24/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Kylie Jenner matched her hair to her colorful gown. The reality TV star rocked a sleek purple hairstyle at the event. 25/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Mike Coppola/MG19/Getty Images Dakota Johnson was one of many celebrities to wear pink eye shadow at the Met Gala. Her hair was more simple, styled in natural-looking waves. 26/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Priyanka Chopra Jonas looked like a completely different person on the red carpet. Her usually sleek hair was styled in curls, and her dark eyebrows were made an icy white. She also wore berry-colored lipstick, red eye shadow, and white eyeliner. 27/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Tessa Thompson's hair doubled as a whip. Her ponytail was covered in latex, and extended past her feet. 28/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Ciara had one of the biggest--and best--hairstyles of the night. She wore an afro that extended past her shoulders, as well as green eye shadow that matched her dress. 29/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Ezra Miller turned his face into an optical illusion. Though he carried a mask, the actor mostly walked the red carpet while showing his actual face, which was covered with seven eyes. 30/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images La La Anthony took a unique approach to her hairstyle. To match her money-themed dress, the actress walked the red carpet with coins attached to her head. 31/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Though Cara Delevingne's makeup was minimal, the model did add one pop of color to her face. From one cheek to the other, the model wore a neon-orange streak across her face. 32/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Lili Reinhart channeled Marie Antoinette with her bold hairstyle. She attached flowers to one side, and completed the look with pink blush and matching eye shadow. 33/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Kristen Stewart paired an orange-and-yellow beauty look with her dark ensemble. Her eyes were decorated with the same colors - Stewart wore an orange shade over her eyebrows, and white shadow directly underneath. 34/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Lupita Nyong' o had one of the most eye-catching beauty looks of the night. She wore five gold combs in her hair, and sparkling eye makeup across her lids. She also donned lipstick in a deep shade of purple. 35/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Nicki Minaj chose to wear pink hair for the occasion. The rest of her beauty look was understated, and included winged eyeliner, minimal blush, and glossy lips. 36/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Kim Kardashian West looked stunning in neutral makeup with a smokey eye. Her hairstyle was just as flattering, and came down in lose waves. 37/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images <mark>Sophie Turner</mark> and Joe Jonas wore matching slicked-back hairstyles to the Met Gala. <mark>Turner</mark> took an extra step by adding bright-blue eye makeup. 37/37 SLIDES 1/37 SLIDES Next Slide", "articleID": "2019050705_00205291_W", "names": {"Ashley Graham": ["Q4805451", "Q4805452", "Q53680948"], "Sophie Turner": ["Q240573", "Q735034"]}}, {"date": "2019-05-07", "url": "https://www.heart.co.uk/news/uk-world/nurses-london-marathon-record-reinstated-as-o/", "content": "Nurse's London marathon record reinstated as \"outdated' uniform rule axed 7 May 2019, 15:21 | Updated: 7 May 2019, 15:56 An NHS nurse has had her marathon world record attempt reinstated after officials admitted rules over her uniform were\" outdated \"and\" incorrect \". <mark>Jessica Anderson</mark>, who ran the London Marathon in her scrubs with trousers, was initially told her bid would only count if she completed the race wearing a skirt. The decision had sparked outrage online. Guinness World Records (GWR) rules had stipulated that a nurse's uniform must include: a blue or white dress, a pinafore apron, and a traditional nurse's cap. A spokesman confirmed the change of heart:\" Over the weekend it has become quite clear our guidelines for the fastest marathon wearing a nurse's uniform were outdated, incorrect and reflected a stereotype we do not in any way wish to perpetuate. \"I want to take this opportunity to reassure everybody concerned that Guinness World Records is absolutely committed to ensuring we uphold the highest standards of equality and inclusiveness .\" Therefore, we unreservedly apologise and accept full responsibility for the mishandling of <mark>Jessica Anderson</mark>'s application. \"The initial decision sparked a passionate response on social media, where many nurses shared images of themselves in their uniform under the hashtag #WhatNursesWear.

The man, who used the trail nickname of \"Sovereign,\" was arrested in Tennessee last month after some hikers reported him to authorities. But he was released after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana and other minor charges. Over the weekend, matters turned deadly in southwestern Virginia, where he is accused of stabbing one hiker to death and seriously injuring another. <mark>James Jordan</mark>, 30, of West Yarmouth, Massachusetts, is charged with murder and assault with intent to commit murder. During his initial appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, Virginia, a judge ordered him to be held in custody and to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. <mark>Jordan</mark>'s public defender declined to comment following the hearing. <mark>Jordan</mark> had repeatedly threatened four hikers late Friday and early Saturday before attacking them, according to federal authorities. An FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in court that when <mark>Jordan</mark> initially approached the hikers he was acting in a \"disturbed and unstable\" manner while playing a guitar and singing. Later that night, <mark>Jordan</mark> began randomly approaching the hikers' tents, making noises and threatening them. \"<mark>Jordan</mark> spoke to the hikers through their tents, and threatened to pour gasoline on their tents and burn them to death,\" FBI Special Agent Micah Childers wrote in the affidavit. Fearing <mark>Jordan</mark>, all four hikers decided to pack up and leave their campsite. Two of them were chased by <mark>Jordan</mark> as they tried to leave, but managed to escape by turning off the lights they had strapped to their heads and veering off the trail into the woods, said Sheriff Thomas Roseberry of Bland County, Virginia, whose deputies interviewed the couple after they walked off the trail to report the incident. \"They described this guy as talking crazy and following them down the trail,\" he said. The other two hikers also ran to get away from <mark>Jordan</mark>, but he caught the man first and stabbed him until he collapsed onto the ground, Childers wrote. <mark>Jordan</mark> then stabbed the woman repeatedly. She fell to the ground and played dead, and <mark>Jordan</mark> then left to find his dog, Childers wrote. The woman got help from two hikers who helped her hike another 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) into Smyth County, Virginia, where they called 911. The victim remained hospitalized Monday. Her condition could not immediately be determined. Authorities did not release the names of the victims. The attacks took place where a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) length of the trail passes through Wythe County. <mark>Jordan</mark> was arrested and taken into custody by officers with the Wythe County Sheriff's Office. The male victim was found dead, with a knife near to his body, Micah wrote in the affidavit. At this time of the year the section of the trail in southwestern Virginia is usually packed with hikers making their way along the entire 2,100-mile length of the trail, from Georgia to Maine, said <mark>Brian King</mark>, a spokesman for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. \"We give a lot of safety advice, which people tend to follow, but with someone with an intent to do evil, how do you guard against that?\" <mark>King</mark> said. Sheriff Mike Hensley of Unicoi County, Tennessee, said he did everything he could to keep <mark>Jordan</mark> locked up after he threatened hikers there and in other communities along the trail last month. Hensley said hikers called his office in late April and said a man was threatening them and said: \"It's going to be a bad day for hikers on the trail .\" He said he sent officers to the location described by the hikers, but the man was no longer there. The next day, some other hikers complained about a man threatening them. Hensley said his officers found <mark>Jordan</mark>, who was intoxicated, and gave them a fake name and a fake identification. He was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and criminal impersonation. <mark>Jordan</mark> pleaded guilty to the charges and was later released. Hensley said the judge ordered <mark>Jordan</mark> not to return to the Appalachian Trail, but he was not charged with making threats because none of the hikers were willing to testify in court. \"The fact is nobody wanted to step up to the plate and press charges,\" Hensley said. \"They were on the trail walking and they didn't want to come back - they told my investigators that .\" \"It's just heartbreaking that this happened, and our prayers go out to the victims' families and to this young girl that was stabbed,\" he said. \"I did everything that I could do. I did get this man off the trail. That's all I could do .\" Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
