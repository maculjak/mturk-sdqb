operating results for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011 and provided an operational update. \"adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items\" including abraxas' equity interest in blue eagle's production, the three months ended september 30, 2011 resulted in: production of 373.1 mboe (4,055 boepd), a 5% increase over q2 2011, of which 47% was oil or natural gas liquids. the three months ended september 30, 2011 resulted in: production of 343.1 mboe (3,729 boepd), excluding abraxas' equity interest in blue eagle's production, a 10% increase over q2 2011; of $8.1 million; net income of $20.1 million, or $0.22 per share; and (a) see reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures below. net income for the quarter ended september 30, 2011 was $20.1 million,

september 30, 2011 was $3.6 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net loss, excluding unrealized gains on derivative contracts, of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per share, for the same period in 2010. unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are based on mark-to-market valuations which are non-cash in nature and may fluctuate drastically period to period. as commodity prices fluctuate, these derivative contracts are valued against current market prices at the end of each reporting period in accordance with accounting standards codification 815, \"derivatives and hedging,\" as amended and interpreted, and require abraxas to either record an unrealized gain or loss based on the calculated value difference from the previous period-end valuation. for example, oil prices on september 30, 2011 were $79.20 per barrel compared to oil prices on june 30, 2011 of $95.42 per barrel; therefore, the mark-to-market valuation changed considerably period to period which resulted in an unrealized gain. since september 30, 2011, oil prices have increased significantly and are currently trading above $90 per barrel. rocky mountain - north dakota / montana in various

(a) see reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures below. reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to fully assess abraxas' operating results, management believes that, although not prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles (\"gaap\" ), discretionary cash flow and ebitda are appropriate measures of abraxas' ability to satisfy capital expenditure obligations and working capital requirements. discretionary cash flow and ebitda are non-gaap financial measures as defined under sec rules. abraxas' discretionary cash flow and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of the company's profitability or liquidity. as discretionary cash flow and ebitda exclude some, but not all items that affect net income and may vary among companies, the discretionary cash flow and ebitda presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. management believes that operating income calculated in accordance with gaap is the most directly comparable measure to discretionary cash flow and ebitda; therefore, operating income is utilized as the starting point for these reconciliations. discretionary cash flow is defined as operating income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, non-cash expenses and impairments, cash portion of other income (expense) less cash interest. the following table provides a reconciliation of discretionary cash flow to operating income for the periods presented. ebitda is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, deferred income taxes and other non-cash items. the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to operating income for the periods presented - see consolidated statements of operations for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income.
