(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) AMATRICE, Italy (AP)--Bulldozers with huge claws and other heavy equipment rolled through Italy's quake-devastated town of Amatrice on Sunday, pulling down dangerously overhanging ledges and clearing rubble as investigators tried to figure out if negligence in enforcing building codes added to the quake's high death toll. Investigations will focus on a number of structures, including an elementary school in Amatrice that crumbled when the quake hit Wednesday. The school was renovated in 2012 to resist earthquakes at a cost of 700,000 euros ($785,000). Questions also surround a bell tower in Accumoli that collapsed, killing a family of four sleeping in a neighboring house, including a baby of 8 months and a 7-year-old boy. That bell tower also had been recently restored with special funds allocated after Italy's last major earthquake in L'Aquila in 2009. The quake early Wednesday killed 291 people and injured hundreds as it flattened three medieval towns in central Italy. Giuseppe Saieva, the prosecutor in the regional capital of Rieti, said the high human death toll \"cannot only be considered the work of fate .\" He said for now, police investigators remained focused on recovery efforts but once that emergency phase has passed, they will concentrate on the investigations. Italy's state museums, meanwhile, embarked on a fundraising campaign, donating their proceeds Sunday to relief and reconstruction efforts in the earthquake zone. Wednesday's 6.2 magnitude quake destroyed not only private homes but also churches and other centuries-old cultural treasures. The idea is to use art for art--harnessing the nation's rich artistic heritage to help recover and restore other objects of beauty in the hard-hit towns. Culture Minster Dario Franceschini had appealed to Italians to \"go to museum in a sign of solidarity with people affected by the earthquake .\" On Twitter, the appeal came along with the hashtag #museums 4italy. It's one of several efforts that have sprung up to help the towns rebuild--restaurants in Italy and elsewhere are also serving up pasta Amatriciana, the region's most famous dish, in another fundraising effort. Amatrice bore the brunt of destruction with 230 fatalities and a town turned to rubble. Eleven others died in nearby Accumoli and 50 more in Arquata del Tronto, 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Amatrice. Overnight was relatively calm, the first since the quake struck without strong aftershocks. In all, the region has seen 1,820 aftershocks, according to the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. On Saturday, mourners prayed, hugged, wept and even applauded as coffins carrying earthquake victims passed by at a state funeral in the town of Ascoli Piceno. The caskets of 35 people had been brought to a community gym--one of the few structures in the area still intact. The local bishop, Giovanni D'Ercole, celebrated Mass beneath a crucifix he had retrieved from one of the damaged churches. Emotions that had been dammed up for days broke in a crescendo of grief. One young man wept over a little girl's white coffin. Another woman gently stroked another small casket. Many mourners were recovering from injuries themselves, some wrapped in bandages. \"It is a great tragedy. There are no words to describe it,\" said Gina Razzetti, a resident at the funeral. \"Each one of us has our pain inside. We are thinking about the families who lost relatives, who lost their homes, who lost everything .\" As all of Italy observed a day of national mourning, Bishop D'Ercole urged residents to rebuild their communities."}, {"articleID": "2012121400_00031219_W", "names": {"Tony Kelly": ["Q16195148", "Q7822698", "Q7822699", "Q7822700", "Q7822701", "Q7822703"]}, "date": "2012-12-11", "url": "http://racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/hereford-arc-offers-ray-of-hope-for-folkestone-survival/1167938/", "content": "news stories which have appeared on the website are available free of charge but stories which have appeared in the newspaper are only available when you end times: folkestone is due to close after next tuesday's meeting picture: edward whitaker (racingpost.com/photos) by richard birch 11:42 am 11 dec 2012 arena racing on tuesday issued an update on the futures of folkestone and hereford racecourses, both due to stage their final fixtures during the next seven days, which offers a ray of hope the kent circuit could re-open at some stage. folkestone, which stages both flat and jumps racing, will close after next tuesday's meeting, but arc continue to explore ways to secure a future for the track, despite shepway district council withdrawing their support for the racecourse proposals within the core strategy. the council issued modifications to the core strategy for public consultation on october 29 2012, following which the board of arc made representations within that consultation to attempt to secure a future for the track. it is understood arc have received general support from kent county council, and further talks have taken place with shepway district council who would also like to see the racecourse re-open and enhance its facilities. arc have also held several meetings with herefordshire council regarding the future of hereford, which stages its final meeting on sunday. these discussions are linked to a new long-term lease which would replace the existing lease, which only has 17 years left to run. <mark>tony kelly</mark>, arc's managing director said: \"we were disappointed by the inspector's report on our plans for folkestone racecourse .\" however, having taken advice, we have continued to press for the redevelopment of the venue. we are hopeful that this approach will yield better results. \"he added:\" in respect of hereford racecourse we have held constructive discussions with the council, but there remains a long way to go. use this instead of your browser's back button"}, {"articleID": "2017082022_00732440_W", "names": {"Terence Crawford": ["Q18763984", "Q7701880"]}, "date": "2017-08-20", "url": "http://chatsports.com/mma/a/source/terence-crawford-plans-to-move-up-to-147-wants-jeff-horn-manny-pacquiao-2-winner-13791600", "content": "<mark>Terence Crawford</mark> plans to move up to 147, wants Jeff Horn-Manny Pacquiao 2 winner Related Topics: <mark>Terence Crawford</mark>, Manny Pacquiao, Keith Thurman <mark>Terence Crawford</mark> (32-0, 23 KOs) became the first man since Kostya Tszyu * to unify all major championship belts at junior welterweight, and unlike Tszyu, he did so under the four-belt era (with the WBO becoming a major title in 2007). <mark>Crawford</mark> stopped Julius Indongo (22-1, 11 KOs) with a debilitating body shot in the third round of Saturday's Top Rank on ESPN main event in Lincoln, Nebraska.

But you wouldn't know it by the schedule, as lawmakers left town waiting for the White House's next move. The House is taking an extended five-day weekend, returning Wednesday night. The Senate returns Monday after a three-day absence. article continues below Trending Stories Mueller says FBI not to blame for Flynn's false statements Trade food for overdue book fines at PoCo library Books Plus: Stories for CP Rail Holiday Train party PoCo puts a notice on title against Art Knapp The ball is in Trump's court, both sides say, and the president met Friday with top aides to discuss his spending strategy. There's an expectation on Capitol Hill he'll reach out soon to offer lawmakers a plan. The president said this week he'd be \"proud\" to shut down the government over the $5 billion he wants for the wall on the southern border, but he has since taken a softer tone, tweeting, \"Let's not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what's right for the American People!\" But Trump doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at the level he wants. Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, made a counter offer during a contentious meeting at the White House of no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion. Without a resolution, parts of the federal government would shut down at midnight Dec. 21. Trump met on Friday with legislative affairs director Shahira Knight and budget director Mick Mulvaney to discuss strategy. Some White House aides were startled by Trump's embrace of a shutdown during his meeting with Democratic leaders, though others argued that it was another example of Trump sticking with his campaign promises. \"The president made it very clear: He does want a border wall. He does want border security. He wants to protect the American people,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on Friday. While Trump has long rallied for the border wall with Mexico, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, Republicans on Capitol Hill never fully warmed to the plan, and they are less likely now to round up the votes for it after losing the House majority in the November election. Each passing day brings Democrats closer to taking control of the House, and with Christmas approaching, enthusiasm for a prolonged fight over the wall was waning even among some Republicans who support it. \"We're out of time,\" said Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif ., who lost a bid for re-election last month. Denham backs the wall as part of a broader immigration overhaul, but said Republicans would be better served by approving a short-term budget resolution that postpones the wall fight until January while keeping the government open. \"Allow the next Congress to come in, get seated, committee chairs to get filled, and then actually have a full debate on a bipartisan solution,\" Denham told CNN Friday. Democrats, meanwhile, are not inclined to give an inch, as seen by the backing Pelosi received after confronting Trump during their televised meeting in the Oval Office. She's poised to become House speaker when the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. As of Friday, Trump had neither accepted nor rejected the Democrats' proposal, according to the Democrats. He told them he would take a look. Trump will need Democratic votes either way, now or in the new year, for passage. The mood on Capitol Hill has quickly shifted as newly elected members arrive to set up offices on Capitol Hill and dozens of Republicans head for the exits. Outgoing House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>'s pre-election prediction of a \"big fight\" over the wall has run up against the reality of the changed circumstances. Thursday was supposed to be the House's final day in session for the year, but lawmakers instead were told to return Wednesday night. Already Republican attendance during the lame-duck session has been spotty, and it's unclear how many votes <mark>Ryan</mark> will be able to garner in the final days of the GOP's majority in the House. Even if a bill with the wall funding passes the House, it is almost certain to fail in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority, and Democrats have pledged to block it from receiving the necessary 60 votes needed to advance. Rep. <mark>Kevin McCarthy</mark>, R-Calif ., the incoming minority leader, said on the House floor as lawmakers left for the long weekend that he thinks \"going into a shutdown is stupid,\" but he offered no immediate plan to resolve the standoff. Fellow California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the top Democrat on a subcommittee for homeland security spending, said it makes no sense to be \"squandering\" $5 billion on the wall when the nation has so many other security vulnerabilities. \"Republicans are driving our nation to the brink of another disastrous government shutdown - at a time of great economic uncertainty and right in the middle of the holiday season,\" Roybal-Allard said in the Democrats' weekly address. For now, Republicans still control the House, the Senate and the White House, she reminded listeners. \"They have the responsibility and the power to keep our government open .\" If the two sides do not reach agreement, about one-quarter of the government would be affected, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks.

In the long term, they have to develop a fund for their future liabilities,\" Kessler said. \"I think they have tried when they have heard feedback from communities to make adjustments and changes .\" She thinks the Fremont County Solid Waste Disposal District is doing the best it can to balance its future needs with those of the communities, Kessler said. \"Some of us have had to find the days of free dumping of your trash are gone,\" she said. <mark>Ray Price</mark> - Republican - 66 years old - Retired after 36 years as Fremont County planning director - Master's degree in public administration and in geology, bachelor's degree in physical geography - Has two adult daughters, one in Lander - Episcopal priest for 10 years Views on...low median income in county \"To be quite honest, perhaps Fremont County may have a disparity against employees and what they need to be paid,\" <mark>Price</mark> said. \"I think that's evident in Fremont County government, and I think it's not just wages or benefits. He thinks the issue of a low median income in Fremont County is not just limited to the public sector, however .\" I think there's a feeling in a lot of places in the county that employees are...I don't think they're treated as well as they should be, \"<mark>Price</mark> said .\" I think if you treat employees with respect they're going to give back to you in spades. \"Views on...funding for flood study\" I think it is if it's an accurate study (the county should contribute to it), \"<mark>Price</mark> said. Lander and the Popo Agie Conservation District had been working on the flood study issue for years, he said .\" To me I think that the federal government has just as good of information as anybody else, so I think we should just use what the feds give us, \"<mark>Price</mark> said .\" It may not be completely accurate, but there are so many variations in any kind of flood; it's not a black and white kind of thing. \"Views on...new solid waste facility hours\" Being closed on Sunday and Mondays, I guess it's certainly an inconvenience to me as someone who takes my own stuff out to the landfill, and it's too bad, \"<mark>Price</mark> said. He voiced support for the Fremont County Solid Waste Disposal District Board's decision to allow Wyoming Waste Systems and the City of Riverton to bring trash to landfills on Mondays through January."}, {"articleID": "2011010601_00184141_W", "names": {"Gary Patterson": ["Q25189982", "Q5525722", "Q5525724"], "Jack Griffin": ["Q14536293", "Q6112821"], "Micah Hyde": ["Q1032003", "Q14918180"], "Cam Newton": ["Q5024850", "Q5024852", "Q591678"]}, "date": "2011-01-06", "url": "http://standard.net/topics/sports/2011/01/05/bowls-were-ball-how-will-bcs-matchup-between-oregon-and-auburn-play", "content": "the glut of bowl games is over except for those special few traditional galas that are always saved for last, \"godaddy.com\" and \"compass\" among them. the water-cooler talk leading into championship week involved a million gallons of water being pumped out of the poinsettia bowl and the life being pumped out of the big ten conference. college football's final goal-line stand of the season breathlessly ticks toward sunday's stand-alone showcase, the kraft fight hunger bowl, played in a baseball park, followed the next day by oregon versus somebody in the mid-january second semester classic. the build-up to monday's bowl championship series title game began in earnest over the weekend with auburn and oregon checking into resorts near phoenix. some folks in fort worth might ask why they're playing another title game after texas christian capped a 13-0 season with a rose bowl victory over wisconsin. it used to be that all the important games were played jan. 1. but the system is what the system is. \"i'm looking forward now to watching the national championship game because i don't have to sweat,\" texas christian coach <mark>gary patterson</mark> said after his team's proud day in pasadena. \"i don't have to call the defense .\" this bowl season has been thrilling, spilling and, at yankee stadium, chilling. let's flip back the calendar: las vegas bowl (dec. 22): boise state defeated utah, 26-3, to cap a 12-1 season that would have ended in the rose bowl had kyle brotzman made a chip-shot field goal at the end of regulation against nevada. it must have been an out-of-blue-body experience for boise state to watch texas christian beat wisconsin in the rose bowl. poinsettia bowl (dec. 23): san diego state out-sloshed navy, 35-14, with aztecs running back ronnie hillman rushing for 228 yards and four touchdowns. the game ball, though, was awarded to the tireless workers who turned qualcomm stadium from an aquarium into a stadium after torrential rains had submerged the playing surface and parking lot. how about a fist pump for the water pump? little caesars pizza bowl (dec. 26): someone ordered an extra topping as florida international pulled out an incredible 34-32 win on <mark>jack griffin</mark>'s field goal as time expired seconds after florida international used a hook-and-ladder play to covert on fourth and 17--with help from replay booth review. insight bowl (dec. 28): the big ten got off to a roaring 1-0 bowl start when iowa upset missouri, 27-24. defensive back <mark>micah hyde</mark> picked off an ill-advised blaine gabbert pass and returned it 72 yards for the winning touchdown. was this the start of a big ten bowl season to remember?

The carmaker's powerful unions are concerned that a 3.8 percent drop in first-half group vehicle output in Germany, fueled by waning demand for the Golf and Passat models, could inspire further cuts in Volkswagen's (VW) high-cost home market. Europe's largest automaker last November agreed with unions to cut thousands of jobs through natural attrition, weed out red tape and cut R & D costs under a so-called future pact to revive the core namesake brand. To counter any weakening at Wolfsburg, VW's core plant employing over 60,000 people and grappling with low demand for the aging Golf, management should overhaul assembly lines to be able to build an extra 40,000 Tiguan sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), VW's most sought-after model at present, works council chief Bernd Osterloh said. \"A high capacity utilization of German plants is crucial for the success of the company and the jointly agreed future pact,\" Osterloh said on Wednesday in emailed remarks to Reuters. \"Only by means of a high capacity utilization we can achieve the productivity targets .\" VW couldn't be reached for comment outside business hours. The carmaker plans to raise productivity at its German factories by 7.5 percent this year and next, and a further 5 percent in 2019 and 2020, counting on fixed-cost cuts and fine-tuning of R & D, procurement and production operations. Investors have said a turnaround at the long-struggling VW brand is key to reviving the group's fortunes following a costly diesel emissions test-cheating scandal. Osterloh, a member of VW's supervisory board, said the carmaker has earmarked another 500 million euros ($587.20 million) in cost savings on top of the 1.5 billion of efficiency gains already budgeted this year, without providing details. VW's works council want the new model to be assigned to one of the three auto-making plants in Wolfsburg, Emden and Zwickau, Osterloh said. Wolfsburg has already been chosen to build an SUV model of VW's Spanish division Seat in 2018, using the German group's cost-saving MQB modular platform that underpins the Tiguan. VW's powerful unions, whose members occupy half the 20 supervisory board seats, threatened to withhold support for mid-term group spending plans on models, plants and technology due to be discussed by the board in November without a production roadmap from management, Osterloh said. \"It's completely clear that the workers will only approve the budget round if the German plants are utilized as agreed under the future pact,\" he said.

Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. The impeachment inquiry into the behavior of President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> has reached a public phase, giving the American people their first chance to reach their own judgments. Two witnesses testified Wednesday before a House panel, including one who told of a cellphone call during which the president allegedly pushed to use America's national security apparatus to do his own political dirty work. Eight other witnesses have been scheduled. These include the U.S. diplomat on that call with <mark>Trump</mark>, at least one other person at the table listening in, and a decorated Army officer working for the National Security Council. But many others aren't coming because the <mark>Trump</mark> administration is engaged in what could only be categorized as stonewalling. Undercutting House Republicans The White House's refusal to provide witnesses, as well as much needed documentation, for a legitimate and serious congressional inquiry accomplishes little but undercut efforts by Republicans to come to <mark>Trump</mark>'s aid. One of the few coherent arguments that GOP lawmakers could make Wednesday was that the witnesses were sometimes providing secondhand or thirdhand information. All the more reason, then, to go to the source. But several of the key witnesses, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser <mark>John Bolton</mark>, are balking. The rationale for the stonewalling is supposedly laid out in a letter White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent to Congress last month. The \"due process\" argument in that letter, however, has been superseded by events. A vote to authorize the inquiry has been taken, and once-private proceedings are now public. Much of the rest of the rationale is baffling, unsupported or circular in logic. It declares the inquiry to be invalid because testimony provided by credible witnesses under oath consists of \"falsehoods and misinformation .\" It declares that Democrats fear they will lose the next election. And it throws in references to the Framers and the Constitution much like a high school student might do in hopes of getting a passing grade on an otherwise incomprehensible term paper. Refusal could equal impeachable Surely, if <mark>Trump</mark>'s July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president was as \"perfect\" as the president says, the administration would want to tell its side of the story. Topping the list of people who should want to come forward is Mulvaney, who last month publicly affirmed that <mark>Trump</mark> had conditioned security aid to Ukraine on the announcement of a public investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. \"I have news for everybody,\" Mulvaney haughtily declared in the White House briefing room. \"Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy .\" The fact that Mulvaney later tried to walk back his jaw-dropping admission only adds to the urgency of his testimony. <mark>Bolton</mark>, meanwhile, has found time to arrange a book contract and deliver paid speeches. The stonewalling can only contribute to the perception that the administration knows it did wrong and is trying to hide that fact as much as it can. Ultimately, refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas might itself be impeachable conduct. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
