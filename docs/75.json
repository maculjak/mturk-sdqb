<mark>higgins</mark> for their service during a recent deployment that took them around the world. the secretary has a personal connection to the ship. in 1992, he was among the delegation that received the bodies of cia station chief <mark>bill buckley</mark> and marine corps lt. col. <mark>william higgins</mark>, who were murdered by terrorists in beirut, lebanon. the uss <mark>higgins</mark> carries the name of the marine officer. the arleigh burke-class destroyer completed a seven-month deployment that took them on ballistic missile defense duty in the mediterranean to the relief effort in haiti. <mark>higgins</mark> was battling terrorists during his duty in lebanon, and the crew of the uss <mark>higgins</mark> carries on his fight. \"we have taken losses for a long time, but you all are part of that fight,\" gates said. but unlike the terrorists who just want to destroy, the uss <mark>higgins</mark> also has another mission. \"you are also part of humanitarian assistance such as your mission in haiti,\" the secretary told the sailors. the <mark>higgins</mark> was the first navy ship in port-au-prince after the devastating earthquake in january. the 7.0 magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 haitians, and the <mark>higgins</mark> helped to bring order to the chaos. the destroyer also can serve in other areas and with other missions. \"the work you are doing against drug runners, against pirates - all of it is important,\" gates said. gates held a question-and-answer session with the crew. the ship was involved in european missile defense on its deployment to the mediterranean. the secretary said navy ships will be a key component of the joint program to defend the united states and its allies from the threat of missile launches by rogue states. north korea and iran are particularly dangerous, and the united states is using aegis ships to create a missile defense capability around japan and the middle east. \"when we have the aegis destroyers we can surge wherever we need to,\" he said. the ships give the united states missile defense capability right now, the secretary said. eventually, the aegis capability will move to land, he added, but he said he doesn't see that happening in the near future. sailors asked the secretary about his efficiency initiative. on aug. 9, the secretary announced he will close two defense offices and shutter the u.s. joint forces command. he also said he will reduce the amount of money going to contractors and eliminate positions for 50 general and flag officers and 150 senior executive service civilians. \"if this works the way i want it to, you get the money,\" the secretary told the crew. \"the whole idea is to reduce contractors, staff [and] headquarters and cut the overhead so we can invest properly in force structure and in force modernization. the whole purpose is to shift money basically from the bureaucracy - the tail - to the tooth - and you all are the tooth .\" the sailors also wanted the straight talk on the wikileaks situation. gates said the illegal release and posting of classified documents on the website poses \"very serious consequences .\" the documents contain the names of many afghans who have helped the coalition and they contain a huge amount of information showing the tactics, techniques and procedures used by coalition forces. \"we know from intelligence that both the taliban and al-qaida have given direction to comb those documents for information, so i think the consequences are potentially very severe,\" he said. no

streets - great videos? limited production 2012 mustang boss 302 set to become the quickest, best-handling straight-production mustang ever offered by ford? boss upgraded in nearly every vehicle system; engine output, brakes, suspension, interior and exterior all examined to optimize weight, aerodynamics and track performance? full mustang team effort results in a comprehensive re-engineering available only through the factory; new boss is not a package that can be purchased out of a catalog or achieved through tuning or aftermarket parts? limited-production track-oriented boss 302 laguna seca model expands on boss racing aspirations, deleting rear seat and adding race-ready suspension and aerodynamic treatments ford buyers guide monterey, ca - august 13, 2010: ford gave the green light only once before: in 1968, management approved a special mustang - a car that sacrificed nothing in its quest to be the best all-around road-going performance machine ever created by ford motor company. that car became the 1969 mustang boss 302, and it remains one of the world's most sought-after examples of american performance. forty-two years later, ford has given the green light again. the team of ford engineers, designers and stylists - all mustang enthusiasts to the core - that created the groundbreaking 2011 mustang gt has distilled a new model to its purest form, strengthening, lightening and refining each system to create a race car with a license plate. its name: the 2012 mustang boss 302. \"the decision to build a modern boss was not entered into lightly,\" said derrick kuzak, group vice president, global product development. \"the entire team at ford felt the time was right and with the right ingredients, the world-class 2011 mustang could support a successful, race-bred, worthy successor to the original boss 302. for us that meant a production mustang that could top one of the world's best - the 2010 bmw m3 - in lap times at laguna seca. we met our expectations .\" to celebrate the racing heritage of the new mustang boss 302, ford will also offer a limited number of boss 302 laguna seca models, named for the track where parnelli jones won the 1970 trans-am season opener in a boss 302. aimed at racers more interested in on-track performance than creature comforts, the boss 302 laguna seca has increased body stiffness, a firmer chassis set-up and an aerodynamics package carried over almost in its entirety from the ford racing boss 302r. click play to watch the 2012 mustang boss 302 promo video philosophy and powertrain \"the new boss 302 completely redefines mustang capability,\" said <mark>mark fields</mark>, ford president of the americas. \"that the mustang team was able to take the current mustang gt - already a world-class performance car - and refine it further for peak track performance shows the commitment ford has to this car and its legions of fans .\" driving the 2012 mustang boss 302 was intended from the outset to be a visceral experience, packed with raw, unbridled performance across the spectrum: acceleration, handling, braking, and top speed are all equally matched for perfect balance on a car operating within the framework of legally defined safety, noise and emissions regulations. \"the team at ford wanted to offer their fellow mustang enthusiasts something really special - a beautifully balanced factory-built race car that they could drive on the street,\" explains dave pericak, mustang chief engineer. \"the boss 302 isn't something a mustang gt owner can buy all the parts for out of a catalog or that a tuner can get by adding a chip. this is a front-to-back re-engineered mustang with every system designed to make a good driver great and a great driver even better .\" led by <mark>mike harrison</mark>, the v8 engine team approached boss from the top down: with 412 horsepower from 5.0 liters, the 2011 gt engine was already an incredible performer. but to achieve the high-rpm horsepower that would make the engine competitive on the track, a new intake was essential. the resulting runners-in-the-box plenum/velocity stack combination the engine team developed was impressive enough that it got the green light after one short drive. helping the intake build power, revised camshafts using a more aggressive grind are actuated with the same twin independent variable camshaft timing (ti-vct) mechanism used on the mustang gt. more aggressive control calibration yields 440 horsepower and 380 lb.-ft. of torque, while still offering a smooth idle and low-end torque for comfortable around-town driving. a race-inspired clutch with upgraded friction materials transmits power, while a short-throw, close-ratio six-speed manual transmission handles gear change duties. power is delivered to a 3.73 ratio rear axle using carbon fiber plates in the limited-slip differential to improve torque handling and longevity. for those who want even more precise control over power delivery, a torque-sensing (torsen) limited-slip differential is an available option coupled with recaro front seats. sounds like the boss while the powertrain team defined output targets that would yield an ideal balance with the chassis, another team made sure the car made the kind of sounds owners and enthusiasts would expect from a mustang boss. up front, a boss-specific intake system is tuned to feed the engine with minimum restrictions. a retuned induction sound tube provides concrete aural evidence of what's occurring under the hood. and, in the boss exhaust system engineers really had some fun. \"with an exhaust system, we have to consider three constraints: legal noise restrictions; backpressure, which can rob power; and ground clearance,\" explains shawn carney, mustang nvh engineer. \"since the 2011 mustang gt exhaust is already so free-flowing - it came in way under our backpressure targets - we already had excellent performance; we were able to tune the exhaust system for a unique sound. combined with the rush of the intake, the exhaust system really envelops the driver in v8 sound .\" click play to watch and hear the new mustang on the road every boss features a unique quad exhaust system: two outlets exit in the rear similar to a standard mustang gt. the other two outlets exit to either side of the exhaust crossover, sending exhaust through a set of metal discs that act as tuning elements before the pipes terminate just ahead of the rear wheel opening. visually subtle, the side pipes flow very little exhaust but a lot of exhaust sound, providing a sonic experience unlike any other mustang - and giving home tuners an additional avenue for modification. \"we added the attenuation discs to meet legal regulations, but we knew buyers might operate these cars in situations where noise regulations weren't an issue,\" carney said. \"the disc is removable and includes a spacer plate sized to match aftermarket exhaust dump valves. if an owner wants to add a set of electric valves, they just undo two bolts on either side; the disc and spacer slide out and the valve will slide right in. and the side pipes are tuned so that drivers can run wide-open and the sound levels are comfortable - very aggressive but livable for an all-day track outing .\" carney further explains the thinking behind the unusual step of an oem easing aftermarket component installation. \"we're ford engineers, but we're also enthusiasts,\" he says. \"we understand owner mods are part of the mustang experience, so we try to help where we can .\" suspension and steering in keeping with the boss mandate to provide the best-handling mustang ever, the already strong mustang gt suspension system has been further refined. higher-rate coil springs on all four corners, stiffer suspension bushings and a larger-diameter rear stabilizer bar all contribute to the road racing mission, and boss models are lowered by 11 millimeters at the front and 1 millimeter at the rear versus the mustang gt. the real key to handling, though, is in the adjustable shocks and struts, standard on all boss mustang models. \"we've given drivers five settings for their shocks,\" says brent clark, supervisor of the mustang vehicle dynamics team. \"one is the softest, two is the factory setting and five is the firmest, and we've provided a wide range of adjustment. a customer can drive to the track on setting two, crank it up to five for improved response on the track, then dial down to one for a more relaxed ride home. what's unique is that drivers will find - thanks to the way the suspension works as a complete system - the softest setting isn't too loose and the firmest setting isn't too controlled; each step just provides additional levels of control .\" also unique is the method of shock adjustment. ditching the weight and complexity of electronic wizardry, the mustang team opted for traditional race-style hands-on adjustability - similar to the gabriel shocks available on the original boss 302. \"the shock adjustment is right at the top of the shock tower, built into the rod and easily accessible from under the hood or inside the trunk,\" says clark. \"you just take a small flat-head screwdriver, turn the adjustment screw between one and five, and head back out onto the track .\" to complement the suspension, the speed-sensitive electronic steering system has been retuned to maximize feedback and road feel to the driver. the driver is also given the option of fine-tuning the steering feel to his liking by selecting one of three settings through the instrument cluster menu: comfort, normal and sport modes help offer track-tuned steering when desired without sacrificing low-speed maneuverability in parking situations and everyday commuting. similarly, boss receives unique traction control system (tcs) and electronic stability control (esc) settings to help drivers achieve maximum performance whether on the street or at the track. both systems can be completely disabled in controlled track situations where maximum driver skill is utilized, or fully engaged for maximum safety during normal driving or in less-than-ideal traction conditions. intermediate sport mode allows drivers to push their cars hard at the track without completely disabling the safety systems, permitting more aggressive driving before the tcs and esc systems intervene. brakes, wheels and tires working in concert with the suspension upgrades, boss 302 receives unique, lightweight 19-inch black alloy racing wheels in staggered widths: 9 inches in front, 9.5 inches in the rear. the pirelli pzero summer tires are sized specifically for each end of the vehicle, with the front wheels receiving 255/40zr -19 tires while the rear stays planted thanks to 285/35zr -19 rubber. the combined suspension and tire package allows boss to achieve a top speed of 155 mph and become the first non-svt mustang ever to achieve more than 1.0 g of lateral acceleration. boss braking is also up to the challenge, using brembo four-piston front calipers acting on 14-inch vented rotors up front. in the back, standard mustang gt brakes are upgraded with a boss-specific high-performance pad compound. combined with vented brake shields and unique anti-lock brake system (abs) tuning, boss drivers get maximum control and rapid, repeatable fade-free stops in road and race situations alike. the mustang team spent considerable time ensuring the brake pedal feel met the expectations of performance drivers. boss receives unique low-compressibility brake lines that expand up to 30 percent less than traditional flexible brake lines, allowing maximum fluid pressure to reach the calipers in the least amount of time, giving the driver a sensation of being connected directly to the brake pads. \"this car is wicked fast, so we put a lot of emphasis on giving it comparable stopping power,\" says clark. \"we started with a race-proven brake system and tuned it specifically for the characteristics of the boss 302 and its mission. they're the best brakes ever installed on a mustang, and they give consistent, repeatable braking performance on the street and the track .\" as a result 60-0 stopping distances for the boss are improved by approximately three feet versus the mustang gt with available brake package; combined with suspension and engine improvements, boss is expected to show approximately a two-second lap time improvement over the gt on a typical road race course. but the numbers tell only part of the story. \"we achieved measurable improvements over gt, which was already one of the best-braking cars we've ever designed,\" explains clark, \"but what's harder to quantify is how good these brakes feel to a driver in a race situation. like everything on this car, the brakes are more than the sum of their parts: they're tuned from pad to pedal to work perfectly as a system, and the difference is dramatic .\" exterior and interior design changes to the mustang boss exterior are subtle but unmistakable. true to its race-bred heritage, every component that could potentially aid aerodynamics or engine/brake performance was examined to make the vehicle more competitive, while chief designer darrell behmer refined the styling to evoke the 1969 boss in a contemporary way. \"we approached this as curators of a legend,\" explains behmer. \"we've taken design cues from the '69 boss street car and the menacing bud moore/parnelli jones race cars and carefully updated them to give the 2012 the proper bad-boy attitude that is unmistakably a boss mustang .\" to set boss apart, each car will have either a black or white roof panel, coordinated to the color of the side c-stripe. available exterior colors are competition orange, performance white, kona blue metallic, yellow blaze tri-coat metallic and race red. up front, a unique fascia and grille are highlighted by the blocked-off fog lamp openings and aggressive lower splitter, a version of the design used - and proven - on the boss 302r race car. the front splitter is designed to function at high speeds by efficiently managing the air under and around the car. it helps to reduce underbody drag and front end lift while more effectively forcing air through the boss-specific cooling system. at the rear of the car, the spoiler was chosen to complement the front aero treatment and minimize overall drag. \"what we were after on boss was reduced overall lift with improved balance,\" says pericak. \"we needed to keep the car glued to the street or the track at high speeds without increasing drag or affecting top speed and fuel usage. the end result is an aero package that uses front, rear and underbody treatments not for show, but for effect - the balance and stability of this car all the way to its 155-mph top speed is just outstanding .\" inside, a unique boss steering wheel covered completely in alcantara suede complements the standard seats, which are trimmed in cloth with a suede-like center insert to firmly hold occupants in place. boss customers who want the ultimate seating experience can select a package that includes recaro buckets, designed by ford svt in cooperation with recaro for high performance mustang models, and shared between the boss and gt500. a dark metallic instrument panel finish, gauge cluster and door panel trim also differentiate boss from the standard mustang, while a black pool-cue shifter ball and \"powered by ford\" door sill plates further remind customers they're in a special car. the boss interior gets an aural kick thanks to what's been removed. eleven pounds of sound-deadening material have been eliminated to let occupants further enjoy the intake, engine and exhaust note. auto genie = helps you create \"first cut\" new car consideration list contact information, credits, and terms of use. these following titles and

was well aware of the streak, the one that finally ended when roy halladay (of all people) crossed home plate in the third inning saturday night. \"it was 38 innings, but we put one across,\" a smirking manuel said. frank franklin ii / associated press so he was keeping track? \"four games plus two innings,\" he said. \"even i can count that far .\" now they can joke about it. the phillies beat the mets, 4-0, in the process of snapping a scoreless stretch at citi field. new york helped the cause with three errors that led to three unearned runs. and on the day chase utley began his rehab 1,000 miles south, the phils moved back to within two games of the first-place atlanta braves. on saturday, halladay played the familiar role of stopper as the importance of a single game increases. that's an unusual feeling for halladay. he's pitching in a pennant race for the first time since his rookie season. \"it's going to be fun,\" halladay said. \"this is obviously the biggest reason i wanted to play here .\" in addition to notching the team's first hit of the night - as well as the game's first run - halladay pitched eight shutout innings. his season era is 2.24, third-best in the majors behind only <mark>adam wainwright</mark> and tim hudson. the hit elicited a smile from manuel and some dugout chatter, the manager said. halladay might be on the most modest five-game hitting streak ever. \"he finally hit the grass tonight, didn't he?\" manuel quipped. \"i haven't gotten too many out of the infield,\" halladay said. \"i'll take it .\" on the mound, halladay was dominant. immediately after he plated the first run, halladay surrendered a leadoff triple to <mark>jose reyes</mark>. he never advanced. angel pagan hit a 93 m.p.h. fastball weakly to third for the first out. <mark>david wright</mark> whiffed on a dastardly curveball for strike three. on the sixth pitch to the next hitter, <mark>carlos beltran</mark>, halladay threw the same knee-bending curve. it elicited the same response: <mark>beltran</mark> swung and missed. \"my command was better,\" halladay said. \"i didn't have as many balls over the plate .\" the one run was enough for halladay, but he had breathing room courtesy of new york's sloppy defense. in the fifth, raul ibanez hit a grounder to second that could have been a double play. but ruben tejada threw wildly to second, which allowed <mark>jimmy rollins</mark> to score. in the sixth, <mark>wright</mark> let a slow grounder go between his legs. instead of the inning ending, two more phillies runs scored and the boos rained down on <mark>wright</mark>. \"i don't think you're going to win too many games making three errors,\" <mark>wright</mark> said. \"when you have [halladay] on the mound, you know you're going to have to play pretty perfect baseball to beat him and we were far from that tonight .\" manuel denied halladay the chance for his ninth complete game of the season, which would have tied his total from all of 2009. having thrown 113 pitches in eight innings and the phillies comfortably holding a four-run lead, the manager decided his ace had done enough. manuel said he is monitoring halladay, who leads the majors in innings, more closely than before. halladay, for his part, said he is ready for a heavy workload down the stretch. \"today and the last couple of times i felt strong,\" he said. \"it's just a matter of maintaining that. the closer you get to the end of the season and you're in it, you get a little boost .\" after the game, manuel, relaxed by halladay's standard performance, sat back in his office chair in a jovial mood. his team is coming together at the right moment. when asked a question about ryan madson's shaky ninth inning, manuel began to answer. then he stopped. \"don't forget,\" he said, \"utley had a triple .\" confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to report
