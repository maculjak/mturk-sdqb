halftime of the the lakers trailed chicago by seven points at the half of their game and l.a. just looked like a team that, despite its hustle, was a bit shorthanded and a lot out of sync. oh yeah, right, that's because they were. l.a. was playing without center andrew bynum and last year's sixth man of the year, lamar odom; the former serving a four-game suspension and the latter having become a dallas maverick after complaining to management for not informing him that he was to be part of the <mark>chris paul</mark> - to-l.a. deal that later was nixed by the league. the new-look lakers gave an inspiring performance in their 88-87 loss to the bulls sunday afternoon at staples center. the fact that they couldn't hold onto an 11-point lead late in the fourth quarter and missed big free throws that would have clinched the game were the biggest disappointments in an otherwise solid season opener for the purple and gold. lakers fans expect victories and championships, so to say it was a satisfying performance for new coach <mark>mike brown</mark> and company would not be fair. a loss stings any way you cut it. still, there were a number of positives to come from this loss, and the lakers will take those into sacramento as they take on the kings tonight in their second of three consecutive games to start the season. what can we surmise from just one game of the regular season? does this team have what it takes to win, compete and contend for the championship? <mark>magic</mark> says \"no way .\" what do you think? kobe's wrist injury affects his ability to handle the ball kobe's wrist injury is affecting his play. although bryant had 28 points (11-of-23 from the floor), seven rebounds, six assists and two steals, he also had eight turnovers-and that statistic alone is glaring. it was obvious that his injury (torn ligaments in his right wrist) affected his ability at times to handle the ball, especially in heavy traffic. true, it's the beginning of the season and teams will have more than their fair share of turnovers. but kobe's were due mainly to his inability to hold on to the basketball at key moments in the game. he actually appeared to further injure the hand late when he landed hard on the floor after making a spectacular turnaround baseline jumper over two bulls to keep l.a. in the lead. the team is taking kobe's condition day by day, and is hopeful he'll be able to go against the kings tonight and utah back at staples center on tuesday. the injury did not appear to hinder kobe's ability to make shots, but it did affect his control of the ball. the lakers can only hope their perennial all-star can play through the pain. he said he was fine, though it was obvious from his expressions that it the injury was bothering him. as kobe's health goes, so go the lakers. 2. devin ebanks gives the lakers much-needed young energy on the court small forwards devan ebanks and veteran metta world peace played about the same number of minutes against the bulls. what's obvious is that ebanks is athletic, poised and deserving of more playing time than mwp. ebanks made a number of nice plays sunday in scoring eight points on 4-of-5 shooting from the floor. he was the only lakers starter without a turnover and he brought the ball up the floor a couple of times, showing his ability to take on numerous roles. on one particular play in the second half, bryant led the team on a three-man fast break and found a streaking ebanks on the right flank for a beautiful bounce pass and finish at the basket. it reminded one of a young trevor ariza and emphasized the lakers' ongoing need for young, energetic legs to get up and down the court and spread their offense around. ebanks played a total of 23 minutes. he easily could play more and appears to have a bright future with the team. indiana and is admired by the coach for his tenacity and defense. but it was obvious sunday that <mark>brown</mark> plays no favorites. he elected to start ebanks and was happy with the outcome. 3. this team still has trouble with the three-point shot lakers starters took a total five shots from beyond the three-point arc, including two by pau gasol, which tells you something about their outside shooting. as good a shooter as gasol is from 15 to 18 feet, he should not be throwing up three-pointers. for the game, the team took 16 shots from the perimeter and made just four, which is an anemic 25 percent. <mark>mike brown</mark> feels if point guard steve blake gets enough minutes, he'll gain some confidence and knock down shots. blake played 23 minutes sunday and was on the court for the end of the game. it didn't help-he missed four of the six shots he took from downtown. the lone bright spot was rookie guard andrew goudelock, who made 2-of-3 from beyond the stripe. he has six points in 13 minutes and gave the team a catch-and-shoot option that hasn't really been in play since jordan farmar's days in l.a. several years ago. 4. the old pau gasol has not yet returned pau gasol played with a lot of heart sunday though it is obvious that his preferred position is power forward, not center. the bulls physical big men continually pushed him outside for most of his attempts and points. gasol finished with just 14 points sunday in 38 minutes of action. he took 14 shots and made six. two of those misses were from three-point range. gasol also missed four of the six free throws he attempted and two of those came in the waning minutes of the game. in essence, they cost the lakers the game. gasol needs to average 18-20 points per game for the team to be effective. he seemed to be playing out of place at times on sunday and that cost him a number of times. pau gasol can be a huge part of the lakers' success going forward. he may be playing with a chip on his shoulder at the moment, since the team was about to trade him in the <mark>chris paul</mark> deal. it's an awkward situation, yet he is handling it like the consummate professional he is. 5. <mark>mike brown</mark> was comfortable and capable in his coaching debut coach <mark>mike brown</mark> seemed unfazed by the glitz of hollywood in his debut for the lakers. he substituted players at the right time, called timeouts when the team needed them and generally gets a high mark. kobe bryant the ball with the lakers up by a point in the final minute. this time it was the player, bryant, who made the mistake. he should have held onto the ball when he was double - teamed and forced the bulls to foul him, rather than attempting to pass to pau gasol, have it intercepted and see chicago come down the court and win the game on a derek rose eight-foot floater in the lane. \"anytime we have a lead in that situation, we know a team's got to foul,\" said <mark>brown</mark> to dave mcmenamin of espnlosangeles.com. \"the shot clock was off and the ball went to the right player's hands. i'm not sure, i have not asked him why he jumped to make the pass. we would have liked for him to hold on to it and for them to foul him and him go knock down the two free throws .\" <mark>brown</mark> is missing a key player (center andrew bynum), has had a very brief time to look at several newcomers (forwards <mark>troy murphy</mark>, jason kapono and josh mcroberts) and is giving considerable minutes to a rookie (guard andrew goudelock) and small forward (devin ebanks). and yet he seemed in control of the situation on sunday and had the team ready to play. most importantly, the team's coach on the court-kobe bryant-came away impressed with a lot that went right on sunday. kobe told mcmenamin: \"they're (chicago) one of the best teams in the league and we did a phenomenal job holding them down defensively. we beat ourselves at the end with turnovers and free throws .\" what is the duplicate article? why is this article offensive? where is this article plagiarized from? amare stoudemire buys baller new mansion we'd like to send you the

Burnett was visibly upset with himself as he walked to the dugout after the last out of the fifth inning. It was easy to see why. \"Six runs in five innings pretty much nails it on the head,\" Burnett said. \"I was in counts where I should have made pitches and I didn't. That's the bottom line .\" Burnett gave up nine straight two-out hits, and the Philadelphia Phillies failed to score after the sixth in a 6-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves on Friday night. Jason Heyward homered and drove in two runs, and Andrelton Simmons had two RBIs for the Braves, who won their third straight game to take a one-game lead over Washington in the NL East. Last-place Philadelphia dropped 11 games behind Atlanta after losing its third straight. \"Not the start we wanted for the second half,\" Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. \"We had some good at-bats, though. I felt good jumping out with the two runs early. They came right back with four runs .\" The game was played in a steady drizzle, but the rain had nearly stopped when Braves closer Craig Kimbrel earned his 30th save in 34 chances. He got Marlon Byrd on a groundout and struck out Grady Sizemore and Cody Asche. Ervin Santana (8-6) gave up six hits, three walks and four runs - three earned - in six innings to win for the third time in four starts. He struck out one. Burnett (6-9) allowed six runs, 10 hits - the last nine with two out - and one walk in five innings. He had five strikeouts. \"Everything was up, man, everything was up,\" Burnett said. \"I was off. Heyward hit a changeup, and the curveball was up. A few innings in the middle, I got it where I wanted to, but I was inconsistent, and you can't pitch against this club and be inconsistent .\" The Phillies led 2-0 in the second on Asche's sacrifice fly and Cameron Rupp's RBI single, but they trailed 4-2 in the bottom half after Heyward hit his ninth homer, B.J.

The theme of the meeting was \"Legacy and Innovation: A Bridge to the Future of Real Estate\" and session topics were varied and included, among others, \"Real Estate Market Outlook,\" \"Where is the Capital Flood Looking to Go\" and \"The Changing Healthcare Industry and Its Impact on Doing Business .\" Mayor Walsh welcomed attendees to Boston and highlighted several of his key agenda items including: * Focus on strength of regional growth by collaborating with adjacent communities. * Targeting growth in underdeveloped areas, highlighting opportunities that will arise with 85 acres that will result at Beacon Yards. * Reiterating his platform for more housing - more senior housing, 16,000 beds of student housing to free up housing stock in neighborhoods, and creating workforce housing with tools such as potential zoning relief at transit hubs. The following are highlights of selected general sessions. Real Estate Market Outlook: Point/Counterpoint * Ray Torto, Ph.D., CRE noted real estate is in a sweet spot but all risks are not priced in, thus the potential for overbuilding exists. Ray noted the U.S. is the best of developed economies, thus attracting significant capital flows. As such, Torto notes as interest rates rise, cap rates may not rise significantly given this extensive capital in the system. * Doug Poutasse, CRE commented that some real estate is trading to bond investors and noted that while many believe U.S. interest rates are low, Spanish and Italian 10-year rates are lower than those in the U.S. with more country risk and German interest rates are .8%. 3D Printing * KC Conway, CRE treated the audience to a lively explanation of 3D Printing and how it will impact real estate and our lives. KC shared information on this evolving technology that is already being used to \"print\" BMW tire rims, breathable casts and pills. Processes are far along in \"printing\" skin, food and vaccines. * Directly relevant to real estate are printers that can \"print\" a housing shell of poured concrete in a week. * Issues that may arise from these emerging innovations include impacts to zoning, sales tax collection and disposal of waste arising from printing, some of which may be hazardous. The CRE attendees enjoyed an interactive session with <mark>Sam Kennedy</mark>, EVP/COO of Boston Red Sox and additional presentations on \"Being a Fiduciary,\" \"Emerging Trends in Real Estate,\" \"Business Issues Forums,\" and \"Samuels' Transformational Mixed-Use Development in the Fenway\" - among others - all of which provided rich content and take home value.

Lopez, who joined the club's front office in December 2014, had his contract expire and the Rapids said they decided not to bring him back. \"There's no doubt it's going to be an offseason overhaul in here,\" Rapids interim general manager Padraig Smith told The Denver Post on Tuesday. \"Both on the field and off the field .\" Smith said the Rapids plan to restructure their front office with the hire of a new assistant general manager, director of player personnel and a head of sports science.

In the weeks since the season ended, Smith has had one-on-one conversations with all players on the roster and informed each one whether the club would pick up their options, but would not go into detail yet on which players would not return. \"I obviously want to speak to all the other MLS clubs as well to see if there's a potential deals in place,\" Smith said.

Following approval of the five-year agreement with Bullis Charter School and approval of placing a facilities bond measure for the November ballot, <mark>Doug Smith</mark> and Mark Goines announced they will step down. Both <mark>Smith</mark> and Goines started working with board members at Bullis Charter School about a year ago on what would later become the five-year agreement. <mark>Smith</mark> had been on almost every one of the \"negotiating teams,\" and was one of two board members who stuck around until the early hours of the morning at mediation meetings to make sure the legal team was happy with every last comma in the agreement. But <mark>Smith</mark> won't take any special credit for the agreement. He said everyone on the board and the district staff put a significant amount of time and effort into the agreement, and helped to strike a comprehensive compromise between the district and the charter school. \"It's always a team effort,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said. He said that Randy Kenyon in particular, the district's assistant superintendent of business services, did a great job giving the board an idea of what the school district needed to provide to the charter school under Proposition 39. Though <mark>Smith</mark> did not say whether his decision to retire from the board hinged on the approval of the five-year agreement or the board's success in getting a bond measure on the November ballot, he did say that the new board members will be in a more stable position going forward. Though the five-year agreement and the ballot measure are fresh on everyone's minds, <mark>Smith</mark> said he's also proud of how much the district has improved the school programs over the years, which included throwing out the \"old model\" of teaching. \"When I ran five years ago, I really wanted to revamp the way we deliver curriculum,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said. He said the district has done a great job shifting away from lecture-style teaching and towards collaborative work and small group projects, where students divide up responsibility for the project and have specific jobs. \"If you look at kids leaving the program, they are able to work well with others, and they are inquisitive,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said. When elected to the board, one of the first things <mark>Smith</mark> had to do was hire a new superintendent for the district. He said the board's choice of Jeff Baier has worked out great, and that the board has had a \"fantastic\" relationship with him. \"We chose someone that we collaborate with well,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said. \"Jeff is always very well-prepared .\" In a statement addressed to the LASD community, Goines commended Baier and district staff for their service during his time on the board and for \"their dedication and excellent service to children .\" With <mark>Smith</mark> and Goines opting out of this year's school board election, five people will be vying for the three open seats. The decision by the two incumbents not to run gave the green light to Vladimir Ivanovic, a Gardner Bullis parent, who said his decision to run for a board seat hinged on whether <mark>Smith</mark> and Goines planned to run for re-election. He said the board has done a good job so far, and that there was no reason for him to run if all three incumbents sought re-election. Incumbent and current board president Tamara Logan will run for re-election this year. Other candidates are Martha McClatchie, a community volunteer and parent of three students at Bullis Charter School, Sangeeth Peruri, a Covington parent and member of the district's Citizens' Advisory Committee for Finance, and <mark>John Swan</mark>. About 25 percent of the district's students are Mountain View residents.

By Colin A. Young STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE BOSTON--The list of guests invited to the July 3 bash thrown by two top Department of Conservation and Recreation officials using state resources is a veritable who's who of the executive branch and the state Republican Party--including cabinet secretaries, department heads, senior advisors and political big wigs. It is unclear who on the invite list--which the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs provided to the News Service on Friday--actually attended the party, which has landed DCR Commissioner Leo Roy and Deputy Commissioner Matthew Sisk in hot water and suspended from their jobs for a week without pay. Roy and Sisk have paid the state back more than $800 for the state resources they used to plan and host the party, which coincided with the Boston Pops Independence Day dress rehearsal concert at the Esplanade's Hatch Shell, a DCR property. The party was held at a condo owned by Ron Kaufman, the state's Republican national committeeman. Among those invited to the party were: Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Matthew Beaton, Administration and Finance Secretary Kristen Lepore, Revenue Commissioner <mark>Michael Heffernan</mark>, state GOP chairwoman <mark>Kirsten Hughes</mark>, <mark>Baker</mark> Deputy Chief of Staff <mark>Michael</mark> Vallarelli, <mark>Baker</mark> Senior Advisor Tim Buckley, Legislative Affairs Director Ryan Coleman, Deputy Chief of Community Relations and Constituent Affairs Mindy d'Arbeloff, Commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources Judith Judson, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Martin Suuberg and 173 others. Advertisement The list provided contains a number of misspellings of people's names, and does not identify invitees by job title. Roy and Sisk used DCR-rented golf carts driven by DCR employees working at the Esplanade to ferry guests from the party to the Hatch Shell for a Boston Pops Independence Day dress rehearsal concert, according to a DCR memo. Earlier this week, Gov. <mark>Charlie Baker</mark> said he was not invited to the party, and said he did not learn of the bash until Beaton reported the misuse of state resources to him, according to an interview transcript provided by the governor's office. \"Let's face it, the most important thing we need to do as an administration, is to retain and manage public trust. And a big part of public trust is ensuring that we're playing by the same rules everyone else plays by,\" <mark>Baker</mark> said, according to the transcript. \"I think the fact they self-referred to the ethics commission, they've paid back any taxpayer funds sends a good message. But I also think the fact that the Secretary suspended them for a week without pay sends exactly the right type of message, which is that this is not the kind of behavior we support and we don't condone it .\" Groups representing both Democrats and Republicans have called on <mark>Baker</mark> to go beyond the one week unpaid suspension handed out to Roy and Sisk and fire both employees. But Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey said she thinks <mark>Baker</mark> has done enough to discipline Roy and Sisk, saying she does not \"think this was an issue of crimes .\" \"I think the administration took the right action. You've got to take swift immediate action. That is intolerable, unacceptable and I'm glad the administration took the action that it took,\" Healey told reporters Thursday at an event in Roxbury. \"The administration took the appropriate action, it appears. I don't know all the specifics of the matter .\" "}]
