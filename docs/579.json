This year, US retailers announced 9,302 store closings, a 59% jump from 2018 and the highest number since Coresight Research began tracking the data in 2012. Bankruptcies in the retail sector intensified this year and many struggling chains cut stores. That led to a spike in closings. Payless, Gymboree, Charlotte Russe and Shopko all filed for bankruptcy and closed a combined 3,720 stores, according to Coresight. The majority of those were because of Payless, which filed for its second bankruptcy in February and shuttered 2,100 US stores. Discount chain Fred's filed for bankruptcy in September and closed 564 stores. Forever 21 also filed for bankruptcy that month and said it will close up to 178 stores. Forever 21's closures are not in Coresight's report since they are not finalized. Other retailers, such as <mark>Ann Taylor</mark> parent Ascena Retail, Family Dollar, GNC, Walgreens, Signet Jewelers, Victoria's Secret and JCPenney, slashed their store footprints to save money and prop up higher-performing stores. Family Dollar closed 359 this year, while Signet, the parent company of mall stalwarts Kay, Jared and Zales, announced 159 closures. Thousands more store closings could be on the way in the coming years as online shopping continues to replace purchases at physical stores and eat into retailers' profits. High debt levels and rent have also burdened traditional retailers. Online sales make up around 16% of retail sales today, but they will rise to 25% by 2026, UBS analysts estimated in a research report. That could force up to 75,000 mores stores to close by 2026, including more than 20,000 clothing stores and about 10,000 consumer electronics stores, UBS estimates. Thousands of home furnishings and sporting goods stores will also need to close as online shopping grows rapidly. Even thriving retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy quietly closed a handful of their stores--although those companies are opening some, too. And department stores such as Nordstrom and Kohl's are shuttering a few stores each. As of Monday, Macy's was the worst stock on the S & P 500 this year, losing 49%, while Gap, L Brands, Kohl's and Nordstrom were in the bottom 20 on the index. Moody's lowered its outlook for department stores heading into the holiday season. \"Despite a very favorable consumer spending environment, department stores have yet to catch a break,\" analyst Christinia Boni said in a research report. <mark>Michael Brown</mark>, partner in the consumer and retail practice of consulting firm AT Kearney, said that he expects store closings to outplace openings in 2020 as retailers continue to \"right size\" their footprints. Some retailers are opening stores, however. The Coresight report noted that this year, retailers announced 4,392 openings this year. The discount sector in particular is growing. Dollar General announced it opened 975 stores this year, a similar number to previous years. \"We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail,\" Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on a call with analysts earlier this month. Dollar General will open 1,000 new stores next year and it plans for an additional 13,000 around the country. Meanwhile, discount chains like Ollie's Bargain Outlet and Five Below expanded this year. Discount grocer Aldi and opened hundreds of stores in the United States to reach customers who want to shop for cheap groceries, and TJX continued its rapid growth, opening nearly 200 stores. Some parts of the retail business could bounce back next year. \"Malls are benefiting from the refreshing influence of Generation Zers, who prefer to shop in stores and are driving traffic back to brick-and-mortar retail,\" real estate firm CBRE analysts said in a research report. Online brands will open stores, food and beverage concepts are growing, gyms and fitness concepts are spreading, and pop-up stores continue to be a popular tool for many retailers. A healthy economy should also continue to bolster many retailers and malls in the coming year. \"We expect continued growth and strength for both retailers and shopping center owners as consumer fundamentals remain strong,\" said JLL CEO Greg Maloney.

The family has led a high-profile campaign for justice after Anne Sacoolas returned to the US after the car she was driving collided with the 19-year-old's motorbike on August 27. Sacoolas, 42, and her family had been based at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire and she sparked public outrage after claiming diplomatic immunity due to her husband's job. It was only after she left the UK on a military flight directly from the air base that the Foreign Office wrote to the family to say immunity in her case was not valid. Chief Crown Prosecutor Janine Smith said: \"Following the death of <mark>Harry Dunn</mark> in Northamptonshire, the Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised Northamptonshire Police to charge Anne Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving .\" More: https: //t.co/d1BA9a56Nd--CPS (@ cpsuk) December 20, 2019 After the <mark>Dunn</mark> family's campaign--which included a trip to the White House--the Crown Prosecution Service announced on Friday that Sacoolas has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Prosecutors have begun the extradition process to bring her back to the UK. A statement from Amy Jeffress, Sacoolas's lawyer, said she had \"co-operated fully with the investigation\". She added: \"Anne will not return voluntarily to the United Kingdom to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident .\" Please see statement issued on behalf of the Parents of #HarryDunn. #Justice 4harry @ Justice4Harry https: //t.co/j4KaF3A7c0--Radd Seiger (@ RaddSeiger) December 21, 2019 <mark>Dunn</mark> family spokesman Radd Seiger said: \"I know (Ms Jeffress) to be one of the finest and most outstanding lawyers in the USA. Her statement however boggles the mind and is deeply disturbing .\" For Ms Jeffress to seek to undermine one of the most mature, well-developed legal systems in the world, which has fairness at its heart, and which many countries around the world have modelled their legal systems on, is unbecoming of any lawyer, let alone someone of her stature. \"Mr Seiger urged Sacoolas to\" put that defence forward in court here rather than ventilate it publicly \". He added:\" Like everyone else (in the UK) she will get a fair trial. \"After the CPS decision on Friday, a spokesman for the US State Department said it was\" disappointed \", adding it feared the move would\" not bring a resolution closer \". The department maintained that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity at the time of the incident. It added:\" It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an egregious abuse. \"", "articleID": "2019122113_00099565_W", "names": {"Harry Dunn": ["Q5668498", "Q59196545"]}}, {"date": "2019-12-20", "url": "http://brazilbusiness.einnews.com/article/505450927/d26y4Hb7nIPvdzO-", "content": "News> Business Close <mark>Andrew Bailey</mark> named next Bank of England governor as Mark Carney steps down Head of City watchdog takes over on 16 March 2020 after nine-month long search to find Canadian's replacement Samuel Lovett @ samueljlovett Friday 20 December 2019 09:45 {{^ moreThanTen}} {{total}} comments {{/ moreThanTen}} <mark>Andrew Bailey</mark>, the current head of the Financial Conduct Authority, has been named as the next governor of the Bank of England.

Britain will go to the polls on December 12 AFP via Getty \"The Bank has a very important job and, as Governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does,\" he added. The Treasury revealed that, in order to \"provide for a smooth transition\" , Mr Carney would extend his term until mid-March, at which point his successor will officially take charge. Mr <mark>Bailey</mark> has been appointed on an eight-year contract and will receive a salary of \u00a3 495,000. The search for the 121st governor began in April, with London School of Economics director Minouche Shafik, Santander UK chairwoman Shriti Vadera and a former member of the US Federal Reserve's board of governors, Kevin Warsh, also in contention to replace Mr Carney. Although Mr <mark>Bailey</mark> is viewed as a safe pair of hands on account of his experience as head of the City watchdog, The Independent understands that there is concern within the Bank that \"nothing will change\" under the 60-year-old. Ms Shafik, who served as the deputy governor between August 2014 and February 2017, was among the favourites to succeed Mr Carney. The decision to overlook the 57-year-old has been met with \"disappointment\" among some insiders at the Bank. Shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> expressed his concern over the appointment, tweeting: \"As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA <mark>Andrew Bailey</mark> will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy & like Mark Carney understands the climate change threat .\" Mr Carney, who twice extended his tenure, was the first non-Briton to be become governor of the Bank of England. The Canadian succeeded Sir <mark>Mervyn King</mark> in July 2013 and later said he would stay for an extra year after his tenure ended--until June 2018--but was then persuaded by then chancellor <mark>Philip Hammond</mark> to extend his term by another seven months to help ease disruption from Brexit.
