At which point even if Congress hangs on to sanctions, it will make no difference.

Federal police officers had been monitoring Mather, the court heard, as part of an operation targeting the Lone Wolf outlaw motorcycle gang.

Photo: Supplied Police raided the Mount Richon rental home after Mather arrived there and after he had met with a patched member of the Lone Wolf gang. As police officers made their way to the back of the property, they saw Mather holding open the lid of the spa and emptying methamphetamine from plastic bags into it. Advertisement In doing so, he also spilled a quantity of the drug onto the ground next to the spa. Details of how police were able to extract large quantities of the drug from the spa water were revealed in court as the pair were sentenced. Police had intended to empty the entire contents of the spa - some 700 litres of water - into 25 large plastic containers. But the containers were only able to hold 595 litres, so only 595 litres of the spa water was tested. Police emptied the other 105 litres of remaining spa water onto the back lawn. ChemCentre specialists took samples from each of the 25 containers. The samples were tested and the concentration levels of methamphetamine in each one was determined. From those concentration levels, police were able to calculate the amount of meth in each of the 25 containers. The total amount of methamphetamine seized by police from the scene was 2.1 kg, including 1.7 kg from the spa water. The drugs had a street value of more than $2 million. Mather pleaded guilty to one count of possessing methamphetamine with intent to sell or supply. He was jailed for 13 years. Rowson was convicted after a trial of three offences relating to the seized drugs and weapons found in the home. He was jailed for 15 years.

If he reckons we should go for someone I will back his judgement 100 per cent .\" As <mark>Paul Lambert</mark> plots the next phase of Villa's recruitment he can rely on a talent-spotter who puts <mark>Simon Cowell</mark> and Co to shame. <mark>Lambert</mark> uses Culverhouse as a sounding board for all transfer transactions and the right-hand man has an impressive track record for identifying potential signings, too. During their seven-year association at Wycombe, Colchester, Norwich and now Villa, Culverhouse has alerted <mark>Lambert</mark> to a host of promising players, who the Scottish boss has subsequently signed. <mark>Ashley Westwood</mark> is one such example, with Culverhouse spotting very early the ability the former Crewe midfielder is now showcasing on the Premier League stage. \"I remember Ian saying a few years back\" there's a lad at Crewe you should keep your eye on'. <mark>Ashley</mark> has been fantastic for us. \"It is not just player recruitment where <mark>Lambert</mark> trusts Culverhouse implicitly - their entire football philosophy has been in sync since teaming up at Wycombe in 2006. Culverhouse was a youth coach at Adams Park then, having made more moves during his fledgling coaching career than the loyal Norwich stalwart did during his playing days. Regarded as a Canaries legend for his part in their early 1990s heyday, the full-back-turned-sweeper spent almost a decade there, helping them challenge towards the top of the top-flight table and embark on a UEFA Cup adventure, including a famous victory over Bayern Munich. The former Tottenham trainee left to join Swindon in 1994, spent four years at the County Ground and then went to Brighton, where he hung up his playing boots in 2000. Seagulls boss <mark>Jeff Wood</mark> gave him his first taste of coaching with a backroom role and Culverhouse later returned the favour by recruiting him as Norwich's goalkeeping coach. After leaving Brighton, Culverhouse coached at Barnet and Leyton Orient, progressing to assistant manager under John Still and Martin Ling .\" Ian was an excellent coach but things broke down on a personal front between us, \"explained Ling, who replaced Culverhouse with <mark>Dean Smith</mark> - now Walsall manager - in August 2005. Culverhouse was snapped up by Wycome boss <mark>John Gorman</mark>, initially in a youth team capacity and continued in that post when <mark>Lambert</mark> took charge of the Chairboys in August 2006. Soon Culverhouse found a kindred spirit in <mark>Lambert</mark>, who elevated him to a first-team role. The pair have never looked back since. Through Culverhouse's experiences at Norwich and <mark>Lambert</mark>'s at Borussia Dortmund, the duo developed a philosophy based around a strong team ethic and giving unknown players a chance to shine. <mark>Lambert</mark> took Culverhouse to Colchester as his assistant in October 2008 and again to Norwich less than a year later. They inspired a rapid rise from League One lowliness to Premier League mid-table comfort. Culverhouse is trusted to take the lead in the Bodymoor Heath training sessions. Their rapport allows <mark>Lambert</mark> to get his ideas across to the squad, but still maintain a distance - an approach he picked up from managerial mentor and former Villa boss <mark>Martin O'Neill</mark>.\" One of the things the gaffer told me was \"don't let them hear your voice all the time every day because you'll want them to hear it and listen to it on Saturday\" ', said <mark>Lambert</mark> \"So at training Ian does the sessions and I walk around and tell the players if I don't think the standard is what it should be .\" Villa know all about assistant managers going out on their own as bosses from their European Cup triumph under <mark>Tony Barton</mark> in 1982 But while Culverhouse's brother David has dabbled with non-league management, the former right-back has previously spoken of his satisfaction at staying as a No. 2 for now. \"I'm quite happy with what I'm doing. I suppose it's something you'd like to do, to test yourself as No. 1 .\" said Culverhouse. \"But the freedom I get now is good enough for me. <mark>Paul</mark> and I have had a successful relationship, so it's not something I'm thinking about at the moment .\" Their close bond was evident when <mark>Lambert</mark> jumped on Culverhouse with a jubilant piggy-back celebration during the win over QPR, and the manager had no qualms about putting his No. 2 in charge when he served a touchline ban against Arsenal. So as Villa embark on another busy summer it is no surprise to learn <mark>Lambert</mark> once described Culverhouse as one of the best signings he has ever made. \"With the quality of the coaching, Ian has been equally as important as anybody who has ever played under me,\" beamed <mark>Lambert</mark>. \"I'm grateful to have such a good assistant. <mark>Lambert</mark> was pleased a dramatic upturn in form and fortunes guided Villa to Premier League safety during a testing first campaign at the club.

all 75 faith baptist choir members walked onstage in either a black cocktail dress or a tuxedo. choir director <mark>michael</mark> nickelson wore black tails. all night, there had been an aura of insider knowledge to\" how sweet the sound. \"the judges included the rev. <mark>marvin sapp</mark>, a dorinda clark cole. this was an audience that knew gospel music, and that made nickelson and some choir members nervous. jenny horn said later. nickelson said he thought his choir\" might look like a bunch of wannabes. \"\"i didn't want to be a white choir trying to be a black choir,\" he added. the choir began slowly and quietly, harmonizing a gospel classic, andrae crouch's \"soon and very soon .\" then, at the beginning of the second verse, nickelson shed his tails, tossing his coat stage left, just as the choir picked up the tempo. he was in the zone, employing a time-honored african-american choir director tradition of using his entire body to guide his band and singers. he kicked his legs as he summoned certain notes. a mimed pujols-like swing of his arms was a signal for more volume. he may have attempted a moon walk. the crowd roared its approval. choir members got into the spirit, too, clapping and moving their bodies to the music. when faith baptist finished, a standing ovation was unnecessary. audience members were already on their feet. the judges seemed equally amazed. \"i have never seen a white brother move like that,\" said cole, speaking of nickelson's performance. dwight stone, a dj from 100.3 the beat (katz-fm). \"that sounded like it was straight out of calif. nickelson said later that faith baptist's audition dvd was nothing like its performance. the choir's musical style is typical of large contemporary christian evangelical churches an up-tempo, soft-rock feel. nickelson said he realized his choir's version of the famous song needed more life. he wasn't sure how to achieve that, but then, in the weeks before the competition, nickelson saw something he thought could help. while watching <mark>michael jackson</mark>'s memorial service, he noticed that as the singer's casket was brought into the staples center, a choir sang\" soon and very soon. \"\"they started slow and built the tempo up to the third verse,\" nickelson said. \"i thought,\" we've got to try that .' \"<mark>marvin sapp</mark> said faith baptist's performance\" caught me off guard. \"thirty hours after their big win, faith baptist choir members gathered in their sanctuary, this time wearing red shirts and jeans. it was 5:30 on a wednesday morning, and a ksdk (channel 5) crew had come to festus to shoot a few songs for its morning show. in between songs, choir members said the enthusiasm of the audience had moved them .\" it felt very surreal and like a dream, \"horn said .\" i've never felt so encouraged, welcomed and loved by a large group. \"choir members said the crowd reaction was the biggest honor of their night .\" if it hadn't been for that audience, we wouldn't have performed the way we did, \"said tracy vittoe. ultimately, though, choir members credited a larger force for their win .\" music has that power to cross barriers, \"said patty colbertson .\" it didn't matter what color we were or what color the audience was, faith and music brought us together. \"copyright 2009 the associated press. all rights

By LEWIS NYAUNDI @ xnyaundih Education CS <mark>Amina Mohamed</mark> and TSC CEO Nancy Macharia after a meeting with Parliamentary committee on Education on recruitment of teachers in the country. April 10, 2018. Photo/Jack Owuor Early childhood development and education teachers will be required to hold diplomas once a draft policy comes into force. A draft framework to guide the scheme of service in the sector states that the teachers will have to undergo two-and-a-half-year training, while assistant teachers will be required to have certificate qualification. The scheme was developed by the Council of Governors, the Teachers Service Commission, the Ministry of Education and the Salaries and Renumeration Commission in conjunction with Unicef. Upon employment, the teachers will have a chance to move up the promotion ladder in six grades. The scheme also allows bachelor degree holders to compete for administrative roles currently reserved for P1 teachers. The framework has yet to be launched as the sector players await the approval of the ECDE Bill of 2014. On Thursday, Council of Governors education committee chairman Paul Chepkwony (Kericho) said the main problem hampering proper facilitation of ECDE education is inadequate funding from the Exchequer. \"The CoG is lobbying for more funds from the national government to support the sector. It has not been the most successful sector in the country because it is highly underfunded,\" he said. Chepkwony spoke during a joint meeting of ECDE teachers, the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development and other players. He said the scheme seeks to harmonise salaries to reduce pay disparityies among the counties. Education CS <mark>Amina Mohamed</mark> said the government is finalising quality standard guidelines, the national pre-primary education policy, the national competence-based assessment tool and review of teacher education curriculum. Kenya Publishers' Association chairman Lawrence Njagi raised concerns over misleading teaching materials for ECDE. He said unapproved materials hurt education quality. He cited charts with wrong sounds mismatched with letters."}, {"articleID": "2013123002_00055443_W", "names": {"Kyle Smith": ["Q11863385", "Q15043215", "Q24005542", "Q26837179", "Q6451443", "Q6451444"]}, "date": "2013-12-29", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2013/12/navy-seals-humiliated-by-political-correctness/", "content": "WND Exclusive: N.Y.
