our addiction to fossil fuels tianjin, china--though chinese workers this week celebrated the 61st anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic of china, a holiday season as significant as july 4 in the united states, a swarm of construction laborers at china's greengen coal-fired gasification power plant were busy welding pipes, fitting massive joints, and bending steel for forms to be filled with concrete. since construction on the $1 billion project began in june 2009, said <mark>li liangshi</mark>, the deputy chief engineer, the dusty construction site has been a nonstop 24/7 hive of activity for 2,100 workers. next year, the consortium of companies financing the project, five of them chinese plus peabody coal, an american producer, plan to start operations. greengen's principle purpose is demonstrating advanced chinese technology to burn coal much more efficiently than conventional power plants, remove many other troubling air pollutants, and prove that its climate-changing carbon emissions can be safely captured. much of the sequestered carbon will be pumped into oil wells to increase production in one of the china's mature oil fields. \"china has a lot of coal,\" said deborah seligsohn, the principal advisor of the world resource institute's china climate and energy program, who joined a clean air task force/uscan-sponsored tour of the plant on thursday. \"this project deals with efficiency and pollution abatement in a fairly clean way .\" outside stalled negotiations, promising steps this week the un climate negotiations inside the expansive meijiang convention and exhibition center here have been stymied, in large part by a dispute between china and the united states about how those two countries take action to combat climate change and how they will measure progress toward those ends. outside the closed negotiating sessions, a series of side events convened by ngos and governments, have detailed the progress, some of it quite impressive, that both countries are making to advance clean technology and energy efficiency that are intended to simultaneously build economic vibrancy while lowering carbon emissions. in some cases, chinese and american companies are cooperating on clean energy and efficiency projects. greengen illustrated both the competition and cooperation between china and the u.s. to develop the tools and technology to burn coal more efficiently, and to safely dispose of its dangerous emissions. in terms of investment and the number of projects, the u.s. and china are both working to perfect the technology, design and deploy the equipment, and command the potential multi-billion dollar annual market for what both countries call \"clean coal\" power, but more accurately can be called \"advanced coal .\" greengen will test gasification technology developed by china's thermal power research institute (tpri). tpri has licensed the gasification technology deployed at greengen to houston-based future fuels llc. future fuels plans to use the technology at its good spring igcc project in pennsylvania, which it expects will deliver 270-megawatts of electricity while capturing over 50 percent of the co2 output initially and nearly 100 percent by 2020. coal in the china, u.s. path to lower carbon future coal's influence in both countries on climate change is significant. the u.s. environmental protection agency reported last year that coal combustion at american utilities accounts for 2.7 billion tons of the roughly 6 billion tons of annual u.s. carbon emissions. in rapidly developing china, coal accounts for 80 percent of the 6.3 billion tons of carbon emissions, or about a quarter of all the climate-changing emissions globally. both governments, along with utilities and manufacturers see the need to reduce coal's influence on global warming, and an opportunity to build economic strength in reaching that goal. last november, during a trip to china, president obama and chinese president hu jintao formally announced the establishment of a joint clean energy research center to collaborate on the science and development of low-carbon energy, and to cooperate specifically on generating energy from coal with much less pollution. in march, steven chu, the american secretary of energy, announced that over the next five years the energy department would invest $37.5 million in the joint center to support research conducted at a facility in the u.s. and another in china. the united states, according to the department of energy, also is spending $3.4 billion to leverage $8 billion more in private investments to build a national array of plants that demonstrate ccs technology, and that showcase new combustion techniques. advanced coal projects they include the $1 billion u.s. investment, just announced in september, for futuregen, to build a high-tech oxygen equipped coal boiler unit to an existing 200-megawatt unit at an american energy resources plant in meredosia, illinois, and then deploy ccs technology to sequester the carbon emissions. the doe also just approved a $308 million investment in a $2.8 billion kern county, california plant to develop cleaner combustion technology and carbon sequestration techniques. other investments include $350 million toward a $1.7 billion a state of the art integrated gasification combined cycle (igcc) plant with carbon emissions directed to producing more oil in old wells in texas, and $36 million for a $2.15 billion igcc plant in minnesota. private igcc plants are under development in indiana and pennsylvania as well, and the duke power plant in indiana is testing ccs storage techniques. recent study by the brookings institution u.s. and chinese companies are collaborating on a number of projects. in august 2009, duke energy signed a memorandum of understanding with huaneng for developing renewable and clean energy technologies. in september 2009, southern company and kbr inc. agreed to license their igcc technology to the beijing guoneng yinghua clean energy engineering company. peabody coal is an investor in the greengen project. huaneng joined the futuregen industrial alliance. here in tianjin, the greengen project is at the head of a pack of chinese power plants designed to burn coal more efficiently and to develop and prove ccs techniques. china has built over 20 supercritical and ultra-supercritical power plants that operate at extremely high water temperatures and pressures that produce much higher efficiencies, producing more power with less coal, and thus lower emissions per megawatt of power generated. according to the world resources institute, china has developed and approved seven major energy projects to demonstrate ccs techniques, and to develop more efficient energy generating practices. they include the 845-megawatt huaneng gaobeidian co-generation plant in beijing, the first in china to fully test co2 capture, and features a full suite of environmental controls. during winter months, steam from the plant is used for district heating, and efficiency can be has high as 84 percent. engineers estimate the plant uses about 400,000 tons less coal annually than a similarly-sized conventional plant. greengen could be big step greengen represents the next step in china's drive for higher efficiency and lower pollution in generating power from coal. when the first of three phases opens next year, greengen will be the first utility-scale igcc power plant in china, and one of the few operating in the world. when fully operational in 2014, chinese officials assert, greengen will generate 650-megawatts at 60 percent to 80 percent efficiency - about twice the efficiency of conventional coal-fired power plants - and dispose of its climate-changing emissions through carbon capture and storage (ccs) technology. some of the emissions will be pumped into wells and used to increase oil production in one of china's older oil fields, which is close by. if the plant is a success, said jiang kejun, a director of research for the energy research institute, a unit of the national development and reform commission, china is prepared to build 20 more such gasification and ccs power plants. \"we want to make sure it works,\" he said. in tianjin, china and the u.s. similarities overshadow differences china's first

second nevada governor debate nevada's gubernatorial candidates took jabs at each other in the second of four debates thursday, with democrat <mark>rory reid</mark> criticizing republican opponent brian sandoval for his lack of experience running a complex government and lack of a plan to fix nevada's estimated $3 billion budget deficit. sandoval, a former federal judge, countered in the las vegas-based debate that <mark>reid</mark>'s budget plan is so full of fantasy money that it would be \"laughed out of the legislature\" because it doesn't add up. he also warned the statewide audience that <mark>reid</mark>, chairman of the clark county commission, will raise nevadans taxes while he will not. both candidates have taken strong no-new-taxes stances throughout the campaign, although <mark>reid</mark> said thursday he would consider supporting a state lottery if the profits went to education. \"tonight, my opponent said no to all of these tax increases, but when he was presented with the question that said,\" if you were presented with a budget that includes a tax increase, would you sign it,' he said he would, \"sandoval said of <mark>reid</mark>.\" so the answers given tonight don't compare to what he said previously. \"<mark>reid</mark> continually criticized sandoval for a lack of a budget plan, one he had promised long ago in the campaign but has never delivered for the current budget shortfall .\" the problem with this debate is that it is so one-sided because brian does not have a plan, \"<mark>reid</mark> said .\" i can't criticize it because he simply does not have one. the only thing he has made clear is that he will cut $500 million from education. \"at times the candidates joked with each other. <mark>reid</mark> probably got the best jab against republicans, saying that sandoval was just another republican gov. <mark>jim gibbons</mark>, but in a more expensive suit. yet it was clear to one independent observer that there was no clear winner. those on a reno gazette-journal panel with party affiliations sided with the candidate of their party. both candidates showed strong points, said fred lokken, a political science professor at truckee meadows community college .\" brian sandoval seemed to be more effective in framing the extent of the budget challenges facing nevada and did indicate that cuts would be a major part of his budget strategy--indicating he was being honest with voters, \"said lokken, a former republican who is now registered as a nonpartisan voter .\" <mark>reid</mark> came across as more directed and more specific about most every response, \"lokken said .\" he came across as better-informed and better-prepared on the issues. in fact, he was very confident in his understanding of a number of issues and demonstrated a depth of understanding that was not as apparent with sandoval. \"chip evens, chairman of the washoe county democrats, differed with lokken on sandoval's honesty .\" sandoval saying \"let's be honest' is not the same as actually being honest,\" evans said. heidi smith, the former chairman of the washoe county republicans and current gop national delegate, said <mark>reid</mark>'s mannerisms were as annoying as fingernails scratching a chalkboard. \"<mark>reid</mark> appeared very nervous and seemed to lose his train of thought now and then,\" smith said. \"he constantly punctuated every thought by pumping his left hand up and down while moving his body back and forth like a cuckoo clock. his body language drove me nuts. sandoval appeared more relaxed; his voice and delivery were very smooth. sandoval clearly appeared very gubernatorial .\" a hispanic democrat was disappointed with sandoval for his stance he took on arizona immigration law. sandoval is trying to become the first hispanic governor in nevada. sandoval said he supported arizona's immigration law \"because it was a valid response to a public safety issue .\" sandoval said he has spoken with sheriffs across nevada and \"it is their opinion that we don't need an arizona - style law in the state of nevada .\" he said he would consider an arizona-style law for nevada if necessary. \"i do believe that it is very, very important to keep an eye on what is going on in the state of nevada and if it is necessary to adopt similar laws, then that is something that should be considered .\" that was not what democrat theresa navarro wanted to hear. \"the arizona law that brian sandoval agrees with is a disgrace to our constitution,\" said navarro, also the vice-chair of the latino coalition. \"<mark>rory reid</mark> saying that he is supporting comprehensive immigration reform to fix our immigration problem instead of the arizona law was very important and enlightening. at least he was proposing a solution .\" sandoval's immigration response might prove costly, evans said. \"sandoval probably ended any chance of getting the hispanic vote with his support of the arizona law,\" evans said. republicans countered that sandoval had a better grasp of the economy. sandoval stressed that the current down economy is the worst time to raise taxes. \"he (sandoval) recognized the urgency to get the economy back on track and the necessity to remove the present uncertainly created by the present political climate, but was not depending on wildly optimistic income projections that were promised based on unrealistic revenue claims,\" said su kemper of reno. \"it was obvious that <mark>reid</mark> was taking cues from his father <mark>harry</mark>, while sandoval represented a more conservative point of view .\" <mark>reid</mark> scored points talking about his experience in running and balancing the budget of clark county, by far nevada's biggest county, lokken said. you

terrelle pryor throws a pass against indiana during the first quarter of an ncaa college? by rusty miller, ap sports writer rusty miller, ap sports writer 38 mins ago columbus, ohio - even though he says he never looks back, ohio state coach jim tressel couldn't help but reflect on his 100th victory with the buckeyes. \"it's exciting every time you win,\" he said after terrelle pryor's three touchdown passes and 334 yards led the second-ranked buckeyes to a 38-10 victory over indiana on saturday. \"we've had a lot of awfully good players here and our coaching staff has been outstanding. a lot of those 100 wins have been here at home and we've got great fans .\" this is a place that, if they let you stay long enough, you should win 100. \"after the game, tressel was congratulated by athletic director <mark>gene smith</mark>. tressel's wife, ellen, joined him on the dais. he went on to remember his father, hall of fame college coach lee tressel, whom he played for at baldwin-wallace .\" this was always his team, \"tressel said of his father, who died in 1981 - four years before jim got his first head coaching job .\" no matter where he coached in high school or college, ohio state was very special. \"tressel improved to 235-78-2 in 25 years (the first 15 at football championship subdivision youngstown state). he won his 100th at ohio state in his 121st game, the third-fastest among big ten coaches. and he is likely to be coaching the no. 1 team in the country by sunday afternoon when the new rankings come out after no. 1 alabama lost 35-21 at south carolina. pryor, who had strained a left thigh muscle a week ago at illinois, proved he was the picture of health. he threw for a career-best 334 yards and three touchdowns. pryor hit on scoring passes covering 22 yards to dane sanzenbacher, 60 yards to brandon saine and 17 yards to devier posey as the buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 big ten) rolled to their 12th consecutive win - and 16th in a row over the hoosiers (3-2, 0-2). it was a big deal that he helped tressel get a watershed win .\" i was messing with him in the quarterback meeting today about the 100th win, \"pryor said .\" i look at him as a father figure. every week, i learn something new from him. \"indiana came in averaging 40 points and almost 350 passing yards a game, but quarterback ben chappell was harassed all day, completing 16 of 26 for 106 yards with two interceptions .\" believe me, we didn't come over here thinking we were going to move the ball up and down the field on them, \"iu coach bill lynch said .\" we've watched a lot of football through our careers. and you could tell that's a great defensive football team. \"the buckeyes piled up 478 yards while the hoosiers finished with just 210, less than half their average of 455 yards a game. dan herron added two touchdowns while rushing for 68 yards on 12 carries. pryor's passing yardage easily surpassed his previous high of 266 in a victory over oregon in the 2010 rose bowl. with his sixth straight game of at least 300 yards of total offense, he tied the school record held by joe germaine (1996-98). pryor, who also moved into fourth place in total offense at ohio state with 6,518 yards, finished 24 of 30 .\" he's coming along, \"tressel said of pryor .\" (completing) 24 for 30's pretty good. the big one is no interceptions. if we can do that, we have a chance in every game. \"much like michigan did last week in a 42-35 victory over the hoosiers, the buckeyes scored quickly. it took them just four plays after the opening kickoff for herron to race through a big hole at left tackle for a 39-yard touchdown. after chappell was picked off by devon torrence, pryor hit a wide-open sanzenbacher for the score. saine's long bomb made it 21-0 and the rout was on. indiana, which has not beaten the buckeyes since 1988, has never beaten a team ranked no. 1 or no. 2 in 27 attempts. a week after passing 64 times against michigan, the hoosiers ran almost as much as they threw it for most of the day. photo: ohio state head coach jim tressel claps during their ncaa? sports video: no. 19 south carolina shocks no. 1 alabama report abuse fear the

the pre-season last night against the reigning eastern conference champion boston celtics who were playing at full strength and with the intensity of a playoff game. what's that? none of their starters played? i don't believe you. nonetheless, a win is a win is a win. derek was check out his excellent recap if you get the chance. the sixers continue their pre-season adventures tonight against the toronto raptors. and in case you were worried, mike preston confirmed that they landed in toronto late last night. sources close to me saying they flew on hippogriffs the entire way but i'm still searching for confirmation. tonight's match-up will be televised on nba league pass (channel game1) which i believe is currently free to anybody who's cable provider supports it. unfortunately, it's the raptors broadcast team so no ear candy in the name of marc zumoff for us tonight. but let's get to the links of the day, shall we? today we will recap last night's win, address <mark>collins</mark>' bold jrue holiday prediction, learn about tiered ticket pricing, and 10 reasons to check out the sixers this season. kapono came off the bench and threw down four three-pointers to account for his 12 points and also dealt four assists in 19 very active minutes. \"it was cool,\" he said. \"i didn't expect to play as i sat the whole first half, but i'm a professional, and i'm ready to play and help this team. i feel that my skill of shooting can really help this team .\" williams led the sixers with 19 points and marreese speights added 16 to lead seven players in double-digit scoring. <mark>collins</mark> was pleased that the team had 29 fastbreak points and made 10 of 12 from three-point range. \"as frustrating as it is, especially since i felt like i came into training camp in great shape and was doing well, you just have to look at the big picture at the end of the day. i thought it was just soreness from training camp, but it just never really got better. now, compared to, like, 3 or 4 days ago, i'm feeling a lot better. before, just walking around was kind of a struggle. but now with all the stretching, i'm making progress. i would say about a week more now .\" <mark>collins</mark> addresses his jrue holiday early prediction: phillyburbs.com unlike in his rookie campaign, holiday is facing high expectations - some of which were brought on by <mark>doug collins</mark> saying he could be one of the league's top five point guards by the end of this year. \"you know what, that's good,\" <mark>collins</mark> said before tuesday's 103-92 victory over the shorthanded celtics at the wells fargo center. \"expectations are only placed on people with talent. i've always said i like people to put expectations on me because they feel i'm supposed to do a good job. i think you learn to deal with that .\" \"expectations can either derail you or they can drive you to bigger things. i think jrue's the kind of kid who's going to be lifted by expectations .\" thaddeus young said he and his teammates are confident holiday will be fine. \"he has a whole new system and a whole new everything,\" <mark>young</mark> said. \"he's going to figure a way to accommodate us and get back to his old self .\" \"i know the celtics' starters didn't play, but still that's a very tough defensive team,\" sixers coach <mark>doug collins</mark> said. \"was it against the celtics' second team? yeah, but i'm not going to diminish the fact that our guys fought back and won that game, because it looked pretty ugly with about six minutes gone in the third .\" none of <mark>collins</mark>' starters - jrue holiday, andre iguodala, <mark>young</mark>, and brand - played fewer than 28 minutes, but both iguodala and brand sat for the fourth quarter. <mark>collins</mark> played 10 players, using four substitutes (lou williams, marreese speights, andres nocioni) for more than 18 minutes. speights led the sixers with 19 points. dei lynam recaps last night's pre-season matchup: csn philly with 20 seconds left in third andre iguodala was pusing the ball in transition he spotted an open kapono for three. kapono thought about it and then made the extra pass to williams for a corner three which is closer. <mark>collins</mark> had emphasized such execution on sunday. his team was up two heading into the final frame. \"offensively we got a little better spacing,\" iguodala said of the team turning a corner. \"two shooters out there opens the court up for myself and lou williams penetrating. j.k. came in and got to his spot, i hit him and then he drew somebody that left someone else open. from there we just got a good flow. if you are a team that doesn't have a shooter out there they pack it in and you start second guessing yourself with open shots. you can shoot too many threes when you don't have good shooters, but when nocioni and kapono came out there it changed .\" turner made his second start of this preseason and he isn't shy
