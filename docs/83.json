Initiative 1634--taxation of food and beverages This initiative would prohibit new local taxes on food or beverages. It would not overturn Seattle's sugary-drink tax, but would block any rate increase. Supporters: Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper, Red Bull North America Opponents: Foundation for Healthy Generations, the American Cancer Society, El Centro De La Raza Initiative 1634, backed to the tune of $13 million by a soda-pop industry that sees a threat to its profits in a growing wave of regulation, would ban local taxes on any food or beverage or ingredient intended for human consumption. The campaign echoes a similarly well-funded effort that took out a smaller statewide soda tax eight years ago. The I-1634 campaign is blanketing the airwaves with advertisements that raise the specter of looming local grocery taxes, while making little or no mention of the sweetened beverages produced by the companies funding the campaign. The public-health advocates opposing I-1634--on a shoestring budget--say the rhetoric about grocery taxes is an attempt to disguise the real purpose of the initiative and its funders. Seattle's sweetened-beverage tax, which raised $10.5 million in its first six months, is designed to discourage consumption and fund health and education programs. It has rankled Seattle retailers who say it is costing them business as consumers go outside the city limits to buy their beverages.

While I-1634 would not repeal the Seattle tax, which took effect Jan. 1, it would ensure that no other Washington cities can follow suit, and would stop any increases in Seattle beyond the current rate of 1.75 cents per ounce. When Seattle's sugary-drink tax is mentioned in I-1634 campaign ads, it's often abbreviated and paired with images that overstate the scope of the tax. In one spot, a mom in the grocery store looks at a container of milk while a narrator talks about Seattle's \"huge new beverage tax.\" In fact, milk-based beverages are explicitly exempted. Proponents originally sought a ballot title that included the word \"groceries,\" but a judge changed it to \"certain items intended for human consumption.\" The focus on local taxes, say opponents of I-1634, hews closely to a strategy employed by the tobacco and gun industries to limit the powers of local government, over which they have less political influence, to regulate them. \"This is an existential battle for the soda-pop industry,\" said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, who opposes the initiative. \"They know that they are now in the same light as tobacco, fossil fuels and other products that have negative externalities and affect public health.\" Earlier this year, lawmakers in Michigan and Arizona enacted bans on local food and beverage taxes. In California, where a handful of cities have enacted sweetened-beverage taxes, the soda industry threatened to bring a statewide initiative to the ballot that would have required a two-thirds majority to raise local taxes of any kind unless the Legislature put a moratorium on local food and beverage taxes, which it did. Oregon voters will decide in November on an initiative backed by a soda industry trade group and grocery chains with similar goals. The campaign backing I-1634 says it will close a \"loophole\" in Washington law that allows local jurisdictions to tax groceries--though not through sales taxes. Sales taxes on groceries were eliminated by a 1977 initiative, but local jurisdictions can still tax food items through other means. Seattle's sweetened-beverage tax, for instance, is structured as an excise tax on businesses distributing the drinks. The campaign's ads suggest that other Washington cities are considering sugary-drink taxes and that taxes on beef, dairy or other groceries could be next. There are few if any examples, however. \"We aren't aware of anybody else who has a tax that would be impacted by this initiative or who had been contemplating one,\" said Sheila Gall, general counsel of the Association of Washington Cities, which does not take a position on political campaigns. But the grocery industry is an easy target for new taxes, said Paul Kapioski, owner of the West Seattle Thriftway and chairman of the Washington Food Industry Association, which gave $20,000 to the I-1634 campaign, the only contributor besides the soda industry. Grocery taxes would exacerbate an already regressive tax code in Washington, hitting low-income people hardest, he said, and soda taxes could be just the beginning as policymakers try to change consumer behavior. \"It only takes one city or one group of people to say here's another area that we can target,\" he said. Kapioski argues that taxes like this, if they happen at all, should be implemented on a state level, both for efficiency in administering the tax collection and so that grocers in one jurisdiction don't lose business to competitors in nearby non-taxed jurisdictions. That's already happening with soda-pop sales for Seattle businesses, particularly those near the edge of the city. \"We've definitely seen a drop in sales in that category,\" said Kapioski, whose store is about a mile and a half from White Center, which has no tax. \"There is some crossover there where people will drive outside of the city limits and buy it substantially cheaper.\" If I-1634 passes, Seattle businesses would continue to have a price disadvantage compared to competitors in adjacent cities. That was news to some of the 1,300 people and businesses listed as endorsers on the yes campaign's website, including Aychu Aweke, at a 7-Eleven at the city limits in northeast Seattle. \"Across from [my] store, McDonald's, no tax. Taco Bell, no tax. Mine, soda tax. I have to increase my price and people don't come to my store,\" Aweke said. \"That hurts my business.\" Aweke said he thought I-1634 would repeal the Seattle tax. When told it wouldn't, he said, \"You called the wrong person.\" He wasn't clear on how his name had been added to the list of I-1634 endorsers--which includes small businesses and restaurants, farm groups and the Teamsters Union, which has many members in the soda industry--but other people on the list said representatives from their soda distributor asked them to sign-on, and that they knew the initiative would leave Seattle's tax in place. Henry Kim at Rotary Grocery in Pike Place Market said he didn't want to see other businesses hurt by the soda tax. \"No other victims for Washington state,\" he said. While some individual businesses report lost sales due to Seattle's tax, it's unclear yet whether the tax is discouraging sweetened beverage consumption or just shifting purchases to other cities. The soda companies funding the I-1634 campaign--The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Red Bull North America--either did not respond to questions about how the Seattle tax has impacted overall Washington sales, or declined to comment. The companies have for years been concerned about taxes on their products or ingredients, calling that out among their \"risk factors\" in securities filings. Coca-Cola's latest annual report states, \"Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\" It goes on to note that taxes on sweetened beverages aiming \"to reduce consumption or to raise revenue...could adversely affect our profitability.\" Voters will have more than anecdotal data about the impact of Seattle's soda taxes before they vote Nov. 6. Researchers at the University of Washington and Public Health Seattle & King County are studying several impacts of Seattle's soda tax, including the extent to which the cost is passed on to consumers. Results on that question for the first half of the year are due Oct. 22, said Jesse Jones-Smith, a UW obesity epidemiologist, co-leader of the research team tasked by the city to evaluate the tax. Additional research will focus on whether the tax has changed attitudes about and reduced consumption of sugary beverages, whether small food stores in Seattle have lost sales and whether people change buying patterns at supermarkets based on the tax, Jones-Smith said. Their research will join a small but growing body of analyses that have followed a wave of new soda taxes around the country and abroad. These new taxes differ from state-level soda taxes that have been around for decades in that they are mostly imposed by cities and are explicitly designed to raise the price for consumers in order to reduce consumption. In one study, researchers found that sweetened-beverage sales had fallen 9.6 percent a year after Berkeley implemented the first large soda tax in the U.S.--1 cent per ounce--in November 2014. The study found overall beverage sales did not decrease, leading researchers to conclude that sweetened beverage taxes \"may be effective in shifting consumers to purchase healthier beverages without causing undue economic hardship and while raising revenue for social objectives.\" In Philadelphia, which began taxing sweetened beverages at a rate of 1.5 cents per ounce in 2017, residents reported lower consumption compared to nearby cities, according to phone surveys conducted for Drexel University researchers. \"Taxation is probably our most powerful policy lever that we could pull in terms of really trying to shift use patterns with these risky products,\" said Vic Coleman of the Washington Healthy Kids Coalition, which opposes I-1634. The opposition campaign has raised $7,650, mainly from the Foundation for Healthy Generations, a Seattle nonprofit, and the American Cancer Society. Coleman hopes people will weigh the potential public health benefits before voting to restrict cities' taxing authority. The link between sweetened beverages and obesity, diabetes and other major health concerns was only just coming into focus the last time a beverage tax came before Washington voters. In 2010, the Legislature passed a carbonated-beverage tax amounting to 2 cents per 12-ounce container--a fraction of the Seattle rate--part of a three-year package of temporary tax increases that were also levied on candy and bottled water to help fill a state budget deficit. That year, the soda industry poured a then-record $16 million into a successful initiative campaign to repeal the tax."}, {"articleID": "2020021216_00335981_W", "names": {"John Marriott": ["Q18342977", "Q6246820"], "William Francis": ["Q42319715", "Q8009298"]}, "date": "2020-02-12", "url": "https://www.libdemvoice.org/tag/welsh-culture", "content": "<mark>John Marriott</mark> 12th Feb - 4:11 pm I have to hand it to all those \"recent' Lib Dem members for their enthusiasm.

The man, who used the trail nickname of \"Sovereign,\" was arrested in Tennessee last month after some hikers reported him to authorities. But he was released after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana and other minor charges. Over the weekend, matters turned deadly in southwestern Virginia, where he is accused of stabbing one hiker to death and seriously injuring another. <mark>James Jordan</mark>, 30, of West Yarmouth, Massachusetts, is charged with murder and assault with intent to commit murder. During his initial appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, Virginia, a judge ordered him to be held in custody and to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. <mark>Jordan</mark>'s public defender declined to comment following the hearing. <mark>Jordan</mark> had repeatedly threatened four hikers late Friday and early Saturday before attacking them, according to federal authorities. An FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in court that when <mark>Jordan</mark> initially approached the hikers he was acting in a \"disturbed and unstable\" manner while playing a guitar and singing. Later that night, <mark>Jordan</mark> began randomly approaching the hikers' tents, making noises and threatening them. \"<mark>Jordan</mark> spoke to the hikers through their tents, and threatened to pour gasoline on their tents and burn them to death,\" FBI Special Agent Micah Childers wrote in the affidavit. Fearing <mark>Jordan</mark>, all four hikers decided to pack up and leave their campsite. Two of them were chased by <mark>Jordan</mark> as they tried to leave, but managed to escape by turning off the lights they had strapped to their heads and veering off the trail into the woods, said Sheriff Thomas Roseberry of Bland County, Virginia, whose deputies interviewed the couple after they walked off the trail to report the incident. \"They described this guy as talking crazy and following them down the trail,\" he said. The other two hikers also ran to get away from <mark>Jordan</mark>, but he caught the man first and stabbed him until he collapsed onto the ground, Childers wrote. <mark>Jordan</mark> then stabbed the woman repeatedly. She fell to the ground and played dead, and <mark>Jordan</mark> then left to find his dog, Childers wrote. The woman got help from two hikers who helped her hike another 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) into Smyth County, Virginia, where they called 911. The victim remained hospitalized Monday. Her condition could not immediately be determined. Authorities did not release the names of the victims. The attacks took place where a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) length of the trail passes through Wythe County. <mark>Jordan</mark> was arrested and taken into custody by officers with the Wythe County Sheriff's Office. The male victim was found dead, with a knife near to his body, Micah wrote in the affidavit. At this time of the year the section of the trail in southwestern Virginia is usually packed with hikers making their way along the entire 2,100-mile length of the trail, from Georgia to Maine, said <mark>Brian King</mark>, a spokesman for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. \"We give a lot of safety advice, which people tend to follow, but with someone with an intent to do evil, how do you guard against that?\" <mark>King</mark> said. Sheriff Mike Hensley of Unicoi County, Tennessee, said he did everything he could to keep <mark>Jordan</mark> locked up after he threatened hikers there and in other communities along the trail last month. Hensley said hikers called his office in late April and said a man was threatening them and said: \"It's going to be a bad day for hikers on the trail.\" He said he sent officers to the location described by the hikers, but the man was no longer there. The next day, some other hikers complained about a man threatening them. Hensley said his officers found <mark>Jordan</mark>, who was intoxicated, and gave them a fake name and a fake identification. He was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and criminal impersonation. <mark>Jordan</mark> pleaded guilty to the charges and was later released. Hensley said the judge ordered <mark>Jordan</mark> not to return to the Appalachian Trail, but he was not charged with making threats because none of the hikers were willing to testify in court. \"The fact is nobody wanted to step up to the plate and press charges,\" Hensley said. \"They were on the trail walking and they didn't want to come back - they told my investigators that.\" \"It's just heartbreaking that this happened, and our prayers go out to the victims' families and to this young girl that was stabbed,\" he said. \"I did everything that I could do. I did get this man off the trail. That's all I could do.\" Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Her husband, Eddie, came across as harsh and unsympathetic while speaking to the camera. After suggesting that Ryan Veith might need a metaphorical kick in the butt, Eddie Judge seemed to dismiss Ryan's mental health struggles. \"When you're struggling with childhood issues as a man, you're not a man,\" Eddie told the camera. Ryan is a famously troubled person, from his abhorrent and bigoted statements to his alarming criminal history. Ryan's self-esteem is low, and he had confessed to his mother and to a therapist that he felt worthless. \"Time to move on...just because you see it on TV doesn't mean it's real!\" Eddie writes without context on Instagram this week. \"I'm happy most of you understand this,\" he continues. \"And those that do not, you need to learn how it works.\" \"Reality TV is not Reality,\" Eddie argues. He correctly points out: \"These shows are designed to get maximum reaction from the viewers.\" \"Has anyone reached out to a villain on a TV show,\" Eddie begins to ask. He continues: \"And messaged him/her what a piece of shit he/she is because of what they saw that person do or say to someone else on that show?\" \"Oh yeah, no,\" Eddie answers. \"Because someone wrote that script.\" \"Well, someone writes the script on reality TV .,\" he claims. \"Just not exactly the same way a scripted show is produced.\" \"I stand behind what I said and never did I say that people with a mental illness need to man up,\" Eddie insits. \"I understand mental illness,\" he writes. Eddie explains: \"I also understand when someone uses mental illness as an scapegoat.\" \"Ryan is not mentally ill and he is not using it as an scapegoat,\" Eddie claims. \"He is struggling with life,\" Eddie opines. \"And, you don't have to be mentally ill to feel depressed.\" Depression is literally mental illness, my dude. \"However, the TV show will figure out how to get max reaction by editing a touching moment in such a way to get you to watch for more,\" he writes. \"If they do not, then we have no show,\" Eddie concludes. \"Get it? The end!\" As we mentioned, depression is absolutely a mental illness. It's a brain disorder. That seems to indicate that Eddie is either deeply ignorant about mental health or willfully playing word games. While Ryan is struggling with life, part of that struggle stems from mental illness. However, depression and self-loathing may be factors in Ryan's behavior, but they do not excuse his actions or his statements. As you can tell by the Betsy Ross cosplay that Ryan decided to wear on camera, he is struggling with a number of issues. But neither his domestic violence arrest nor his outspoken support for <mark>Donald Trump</mark> are excused by his mental health. If Eddie had argued that Ryan was refusing to take accountability for his actions and was therefore scapegoating plenty of decent people with mental illness, we would agree. Instead, Eddie decided to make unsubstantiated claims about Ryan's mental state and doubled down upon his unsympathetic words. Not cool. It is entirely possible to hold Ryan accountable and to understand how his mental health and childhood impact his adult life at the same time. Tamra Judge: I'm Scared My Son Is Gonna Kill Himself!

Ajay Woods (fourth from left) receives the Lewis McGee Memorial Medallion at Campbell Town District High School on Thursday. View More Local Business List Your Business Here The Anzac spirit was alive and well at Campbell Town District High School on Thursday, with the inaugural awarding of the Lewis McGee Memorial Medallion. Ajay Woods, 11, from Avoca Primary School and Jonty Nicolson, 11, from Campbell Town District High School were named as the first ever recipients of the award in front of more than 100 community members. The ceremony was also used to mark the 100 th anniversary of the action which earned Sergeant McGee the Victoria Cross medal. The award was created to recognise students who show exceptional consideration and mateship throughout year. Thursday's event marked the culmination of a three-year journey for Campbell Town Anzac Group chairman <mark>Peter Evans</mark>, who was the driving force behind the award. He said the medallion was not just about commemorating Sergeant McGee. \"It's way for us to remember all the soldiers who have served bravely for Australia,\" he said. \"I was immensely proud to see the medallion awarded in front of an audience that included surviving members of the 12 th and 40 th battalions.\" It's great to be involved with the schools and to be able to give back after all they have done for us. \"Born in Ross, Lewis McGee spent much of his young life in Avoca before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force during 1916 at the age of 27. He was posted to the 40th Battalion, and completed training in Tasmania and the United Kingdom, where he was promoted to lance corporal. After being transferred to the Western Front in November 1916, he was quickly promoted to corporal and then sergeant. It was during an attack on Broodseinde Ridge as part of the Passchendale Offensive where Sgt McGee's platoon suffered heavily casualties from machine gun fire 50 metres in front of their position. Armed with just a revolver Sgt McGee made his way forward alone and was able to seize control of the pillbox upon which the machine gun was set. His actions on October 4, 1917 reignited the 40 th Battalion's advance and earned him the Victoria Cross. Sgt McGee died in battle on October 12, 1917."}, {"articleID": "2019061009_00231235_W", "names": {"Steve Smith": ["Q11894442", "Q16885757", "Q23418614", "Q2347298", "Q23978380", "Q28675476", "Q3499110", "Q3499112", "Q3499118", "Q3499120", "Q3499123", "Q376304", "Q463200", "Q51546050", "Q5368718", "Q7613961", "Q7613962", "Q7613964", "Q7613965", "Q7613967", "Q7613968", "Q7613969", "Q7613970", "Q7613971", "Q7613972", "Q7613974", "Q7613975", "Q7613977", "Q7613978", "Q7613979", "Q7613980", "Q7613981", "Q7613982", "Q7613983", "Q9345803", "Q943448"], "David Warner": ["Q3018962", "Q363271", "Q57408725"]}, "date": "2019-06-10", "url": "http://euronews.com/2019/06/10/zampa-uses-hand-warmers-says-finch-amid-ball-tampering-claims", "content": "Zampa uses hand warmers, says Finch amid ball-tampering claims Zampa uses hand warmers, says Finch amid ball-tampering claims By Reuters \u2022 last updated: 10/06/2019 - 11:33 Cricket - ICC Cricket World Cup - India v Australia - The Oval, London, Britain - June 9, 2019 Australia's Aaron Finch speaks to Adam Zampa Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers - Copyright Text size Aa Aa (Reuters)--Australia spinner Adam Zampa may have been using hand warmers during his bowling spell in Sunday's 36-run Cricket World Cup defeat by India, captain Aaron Finch has said in response to a flood of ball-tampering accusations on social media. Video footage showed Zampa putting his hand into his pocket before rubbing the ball prior to bowling the 24th over. Zampa's team mates <mark>Steve Smith</mark> and <mark>David Warner</mark> have just returned to the national setup after serving 12-month bans for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa early last year. \"I haven't seen the photos, but I know that he has hand warmers in his pocket,\" Finch told reporters. \"He has them every single game he plays.\" I honestly haven't seen them (the images), so I can't comment too much on it.
