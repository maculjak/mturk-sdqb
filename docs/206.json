According to District Attorney <mark>Pete Johnson</mark>, Chris Biddinger, 29, entered a guilty plea to operating a methamphetamine laboratory along with simple assault and possession of drug paraphernalia.

It was just good, old-fashioned, smashmouth football. Monroe dispatched Oakland 35-14 on Friday night behind a no-frills offensive game plan that churned out 263 rushing yards and battered the visiting Oakers into submission. In the process, the third-ranked Dragons locked up the Mountain View Conference title and potentially a high seed for the Class 2A state playoffs that begin in two weeks. \"I'm very pleased,\" said Monroe coach Bill Crowson, whose team wraps up the regular season next week with a nonleague game against Stanfield. \"I feel like Lost River and Oakland are both quality football teams. Their records may not be great, but they're going to both maybe be playoff teams and I feel like...the four wins over them is a good statement for us .\" Monroe (6-1, 4-0 MVC) made a different kind of statement Friday, dialing up some old-school playcalling that involved a lot of fullback dives and tailback counters. The result was nearly 5.5 yards per carry as a team and a healthy time of possession advantage that eventually wore out visiting Oakland (4-3, 0-3). The Dragons were led by sophomore running back Zach Young, who had 142 yards on 18 carries and scored two touchdowns--the first a 12-yard run late in the second quarter that gave Monroe a 20-7 halftime lead, and the second an 18-yard backbreaker with four minutes left that iced the game after Oakland had briefly sliced the margin to 27-14. Junior fullback Colton Sutton rushed for 42 yards and a pair of touchdowns, senior Parker Wynn had 34 yards and a score, and fellow senior Zack Esplin finished with 37 yards on the ground. Quarterback Kairen Garber attempted only eight passes, completing three of them for 39 yards. \"We're a little dinged up,\" Crowson explained. \"Nothing bad, but our personnel is a little different, so we knew all week that we were going to go back to fullbacks and just kind of grind a little bit. We haven't really done that this year, so it was something that we needed to work on and something we needed to do tonight .\" Monroe boasts one of the biggest offensive lines in the state at the 2A level, featuring 6-foot-4, 320-pound <mark>Cristian Garcia</mark> and 6-1, 280-pound Jorge Sanchez, among others. Going to a ground-and-pound strategy, Crowson said, was one way of maximizing the Dragons' size advantage against an active defensive front. \"They attack really well,\" Crowson said of Oakland's front four. \"They put a lot of pressure on you up front. I think that was a good challenge for our linemen .\" We were a little cute in the first half, but we needed to just settle in. We felt like we could run the football, we just weren't being real consistent. We made some adjustments and tried to get some schemes right, and I felt like we were more consistent (in the second half). \"Oakland was led by senior Andrew Harrington, who started the game at running back, then moved to quarterback after the first offensive series ended in a three-and-out. Harrington completed 9-of-24 pass attempts for 106 yards with two interceptions and ran for 36 yards and both of the Oakers' touchdowns.

Holding a two seconds advantage to be placed atop the overall classification, Viviani, gold medallist at the Rio Olympics, needed at least a second place finish with good timing but went one better to cross the line before <mark>Marco Haller</mark> and Adam Blythe, who secured the second and third positions. \"It's amazing. This morning I was very stressed but I tried to look relaxed. Two seconds lead meant all or nothing.

I had six teammates leading me out in the last corner. We missed the crash by very little. [Fabio] Sabatini closed the gap on the four guys ahead after the crash.

(AP)--Pushing back against fellow Democrats who advocate a more moderate path to the White House, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday her party will lose the 2020 presidential election if it settles for an agenda that's \"business as usual\" and only \"nibbles around the edges\" of past U.S. policies. The Massachusetts senator said in a speech at a community college in Reno that her progressive campaign has the \"big ideas\" the country needs, including a 2% wealth tax on incomes over $50 million and Medicare for All. She also told the crowd of more than 600 in the biggest gold producing state in the U.S. that in addition to ending all new drilling and mining on federal lands, she would give Native American tribes veto power over pipelines and other development with environmental impacts on lands adjacent to their tribal lands. \"This country is in a crisis,\" Warren said at the close of a speech that devoted about half of her nearly 90-minute appearance to answering questions from audience members. Polls show former Vice President Joe Biden with a slight lead in Nevada over Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden has been critical of both for pushing agendas he believes are overly ambitious and too costly, including Medicare for All. Warren didn't name any of her Democratic rivals during Tuesday night's speech but took direct aim at such concerns. \"Party insiders...think that somehow that running a vague campaign that nibbles around the edges on these huge problems is a safe strategy,\" Warren said. \"If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, then Democrats will lose. When we have ideas big enough to meet the problems in people's lives, that's when we win .\" An individual's first $50 million of income would be exempt from Warren's proposed wealth tax, with 2% levied on every dollar after that and an additional 1% surcharge above $1 billion. She estimates it would raise $800 billion annually. Earlier Tuesday, Warren updated her strategy to combat climate change with a focus on protecting ocean habitat as well as Western drought and wildfires. She released her plan for The New Blue Deal Tuesday as an addendum to the Green New Deal following a gathering with a powerful casino workers' union in Las Vegas Monday night. Th addition is mostly directed at ways to address how climate change is affecting oceans, including expanding protection of marine areas and prohibiting new offshore drilling in federal waters. But it also highlights the need for new plans to ease the stress on critical water supplies like the Colorado River basin, where drops in reservoir levels forced mandatory water cuts this summer in Arizona and Nevada. Sanders appeared before the Culinary Workers in Las Vegas Tuesday after stops in Carson City, Reno and Elko the past two days. Biden plans to meet with the union in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

PHILLIP) Louis Marquez carries his dog Chocolate through floodwaters Tuesday after rescuing the dog from his flooded apartment in Hous...(By: DAVID J. PHILLIP) (Credit: AP) Flash flooding and a 50 percent chance of more rain were possible after nearly 18 inches fell in 24 hours. The National Weather Service had the area under a flash flood watch through this morning. \"A lot of rain coming in a very short period of time, there's nothing you can do,\" Mayor Sylvester Turner said Monday. Scores of subdivisions were flooded, and most schools remained closed, although the city itself was returning to normal Tuesday. Municipal offices reopened Tuesday, and by midmorning, fewer than 10,000 CenterPoint Energy customers were without power, an improvement from 24 hours earlier when electricity failures topped 100,000. Houston's Metropolitan Transit Authority resumed service, and most highways within the city were open. Outside the city and into the suburbs of northwest Harris County, runoff from Monday's rains pushed creeks over their banks and forced more people to evacuate their homes overnight. In addition to its location, Houston's \"gumbo\" soft soil, fast-growing population and building boom that has turned empty pastures into housing developments all over the city's suburbs make it vulnerable to high water. Harris County has seen a 30 percent jump in population since 2000. Its surrounding counties have grown by nearly 10 percent since 2000, according to the Greater Houston Partnership, a business group. Some of the resulting developments include adequate greenspace for water runoff, but not all of them do, said Philip Bedient, an engineering professor at Rice University. \"Could we have engineered our way out of this?\" Bedient asked. \"Only if we started talking about alterations 35 or 40 years ago .\" Rainstorms last year over Memorial Day weekend caused flooding that required authorities to rescue 20 people, most of them drivers, from high water. Drivers abandoned at least 2,500 vehicles, and more than 1,000 homes were damaged by flooding. The year before, flash flooding in Houston and suburban counties left cars trapped on highways. Still, those storms pale in comparison with the devastation from Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. Allison left behind $5 billion in damage and flooded parts of downtown and the Texas Medical Center, which sits near the Brays Bayou, a key watershed. <mark>Jeff Evans</mark>, the National Weather Service's chief meteorologist for Houston, said Monday's soaking and the 2015 Memorial Day deluge were the second - and third-biggest rain events on record after Allison, which dumped more than 30 inches of rain on parts of the city over two days. He said the El Nino weather phenomenon, caused by heightened surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific, could \"be a player in why we've had so many big rain events this year .\" <mark>Evans</mark> said rain fell in some places Monday at a rate of 3-4 inches per hour. \"No matter what drainage system you build, anything will struggle with that kind of volume in that short a time,\" he said. Bedient has worked with the Texas Medical Center on better preparing its facilities for large rainfalls. Those preparations include the use of a sophisticated weather alert system that gives the medical center extra time to activate gates and doors that block excess rainwater. Improving the monitoring of specific watersheds and flood-prone areas might give affected residents the extra bit of time they need to save lives and take protective measures. \"We can't solve this flood problem in Houston,\" Bedient said. \"All we can do is a better job warning .\" The upper-level low that took heavy rain to Texas will pump moisture into Arkansas, although National Weather Service forecasters say the state will not see the deluge that Houston and Dallas saw. Weather service meteorologist Charles Dalton of North Little Rock said the state should see \"garden-variety\" showers and light thunderstorms through Thursday evening. No severe weather is expected, he said. \"There are no signals of strong convection or heavy rain in this,\" he said. \"We could see some impulses sparking off a few thunderstorms, but nothing severe .\" Rain entered Arkansas late Monday and will move slowly east across the state. The southern half of the state should see more rainfall, although accumulations may not top 1-2 inches total, he said. Dalton said remnants of the system should cross the Mississippi River by Friday. He said meteorologists are watching another system that could bring heavier storms to the state by midweek next week.

In echoes of the run-up that led to eventual decimation of Iraq, hardliners in the Trump administration led by National Security Advisor <mark>John Bolton</mark> are reported to have presented a military plan that envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons. This, despite President Trump's well-known anathema towards fighting foreign wars that do not involve American vital interests. The ostensible trigger for floating this proposal is the attack on four oil tankers and an oil pipeline belonging to US allies UAE and Saudi Arabia, which hawks in the Trump administration are blaming on Iran and its proxies in the Gulf. The Saudis, Iran's regional rivals in a Sunni-Shia battle for dominating the region, have said the sabotage was intended to \"undermine the freedom of maritime navigation, and the security of oil supplies to consumers all over the world .\" Teheran, in turn, has suggested they were \"false flag\" operation by the US to provoke a confrontation with Iran. Trump, who hosted an iftar dinner at the White House on Monday, issued a cryptic warning to Teheran amid the US build-up, saying, \"I'm hearing little stories about Iran. If they do anything, they will suffer greatly. We'll see what happens with Iran .\" While it was not clear what the US President meant (clarity has never been his strong point), some analysts recalled the hasty rush into war against Iraq after 9/11 when Baghdad and Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the attack, which was carried out mainly by Saudi extremists. The New York Times, which first reported the US proposal to return troops to the region, attributed the hawkish move to <mark>Bolton</mark>, calling him \"one of the administration's most virulent Iran hawks\" and recalling his push for confrontation with Tehran was ignored more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush. The paper said the size of the force suggested has shocked some who have been briefed on the proposal, noting that the 120,000 troops would approach the size of the American force that invaded Iraq in 2003. It would reverse years of retrenching by the American military in the Middle East that began with President Barack Obama's withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011, it noted. But apparently, hawks in the administration have been arguing that the US drawdown from Syria and its diminished naval presence in the region has emboldened Iran. The US has in recent weeks moved an aircraft carrier group, B-52 bombers, a Patriot missile interceptor battery and more naval firepower to the Gulf region. The Trump administration's dialing up of involvement in the Gulf region, ostensibly at the behest of its ally Israel, comes even as Washington is struggling to manage a rising China, with whom President Trump has initiated a trade war."}, {"articleID": "2012100518_00055273_W", "names": {"Derrick Johnson": ["Q2761348", "Q27842989", "Q40232099", "Q5263041", "Q5263042"], "Brandon Flowers": ["Q309697", "Q4956854"], "Tom Coughlin": ["Q1378304", "Q7815428"], "Greg Jennings": ["Q1544938", "Q5605252"], "Mike Mccarthy": ["Q1933317", "Q21062541", "Q22279122", "Q506866", "Q6847875", "Q6847876", "Q6847877"], "Chuck Pagano": ["Q5115650", "Q761601"]}, "date": "2012-10-05", "url": "http://columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/05/injuries-continue-to-pile-up-for-struggling/", "content": "romeo crennel shuffled into the small interview room, settled into a chair behind a table holding a couple of microphones and launched into what's become his usual routine. \"all right,\" crennel said, \"i'm going to start with our injuries .\" and with that, crennel started the roll call. peyton hillis was out with an ankle injury. glenn dorsey a calf injury. jon baldwin, jalil brown and devon wylie with hamstring troubles. <mark>derrick johnson</mark> a sore groin, ropati pitoitua an elbow injury, kendrick lewis an ailing shoulder and ryan lilja a bad back. just what the chiefs (1-3) don't need heading into sunday's game against baltimore. \"we've got a good football team coming into town,\" crennel said yesterday, \"i think we're probably the only ones who think we've got a chance. so we're going to work our preparation and continue our preparation to try to get it ready to play .\" the only problem is that it's hard to prepare when there are eight guys missing from practice and a couple more who are limited. it reached the point this week that crennel had to ponder throwing practice-squad defensive end jerome long in with the starters for lack of able bodies. the most loathed three letters in kansas city these days?
