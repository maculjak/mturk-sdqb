solved a cosmic chicken-and-the-egg problem: which came first - galaxies or the supermassive black holes in their cores? for several years now, researchers have known that galaxies and black holes must have co-evolved, with budding galaxies feeding material to a growing black hole while the immense gravity of the black hole generated in its vicinity tremendous radiation that in turn powered star formation. but the scientists hadn't pegged the starting point .\" it looks like black holes came first. the evidence is piling up, \"said chris carilli of the national radio astronomy observatory in new mexico. carilli presented his team's findings here today at the 213th meeting of the american astronomical society. previous studies of nearby galaxies revealed an intriguing link between the masses of the black holes at their centers and the mass of the central\" bulge \"(a mass of tightly packed stars and gas) in the galaxies: the black hole's mass is always about one one-thousandth the mass of the surrounding bulge. the ratio is the same for galaxies of all ages and sizes, whether the central black hole is a few million or many billions of times the mass of our sun .\" this constant ratio indicates that the black hole and the bulge affect each others' growth in some sort of interactive relationship, \"said study team member dominik riechers of caltech .\" the big question has been whether one grows before the other or if they grow together, maintaining their mass ratio throughout the entire process. \"to help answer this question, carilli, riechers and the rest of their team used the very large array radio telescope in new mexico and the plateau de bure interferometer in france to peer back to near the beginning of the universe, thought to be 13.7 billion years ago, when the first galaxies were forming .\" we finally have been able to measure black-hole and bulge masses in several galaxies seen as they were in the first billion years after the big bang, and the evidence suggests that the constant ratio seen nearby may not hold in the early universe, \"said study team member <mark>fabian walter</mark> of the max-planck institute for radioastronomy in germany .\" the black holes in these young galaxies are much more massive compared to the bulges than those seen in the nearby universe. \"[...] this should be the year when we make a concerted effort to wipe out superstitious and irrational beliefs of all kinds. this category includes not only religious beliefs but also absurd and divisive and harmful ideas such as that the people who share one's own nationality and ethnicity are somehow better than those who don't, and thus deserve greater allegiance and consideration. familiarity breeds false rationality. for many people, irrational beliefs are what other people hold, not their own. their own irrational beliefs seem reasonable because they acquired them at a very young age when they tended to believe what the adults in their lives told them and they have rarely been asked why they believe. the power of myths is that it never even occurs to people to question the validity of ideas that they have always had and which everyone around them seems to share. . as i wrote earlier, in his book the god delusion (p. 178), richard dawkins quotes the anthropologist pascal boyer who once over dinner at a cambridge university college recounted the beliefs of the fang people of cameroon who believed that\" witches have an extra internal animal-like organ that flies away at night and ruins other people's crops or poisons their blood. it is also said that these witches sometimes assemble for huge banquets, where they will devour their victims and plan future attacks. many will tell you that a friend of a friend actually saw witches flying over the village at night, sitting on a banana leaf and throwing magical darts at various unsuspecting victims. \"bayer says he was dumbfounded when a cambridge theologian turned to him and said\" this is what makes anthropology so fascinating and so difficult too. you have to explain how people can believe such nonsense. \"(italics on original) dawkins points out that the theologian, as a mainstream christian, did not see any irony at all in referring to the fang people's beliefs as nonsense even while he himself believed many or all of the following beliefs: * in the time of the ancestors, a man was born to a virgin mother with no biological father being involved. * the same fatherless man called out to a friend called lazarus, who had been dead long enough to stink, and lazarus came back to life. * the fatherless man himself came alive after being dead and buried three days. * forty days later, the fatherless man went to the top of a hill and then disappeared bodily in to the sky. * if you murmur thoughts privately in your head, the fatherless man, and his\" father' (who is also himself) will hear your thoughts and may act upon them. he is simultaneously able to hear the thoughts of everybody else in the world. * if you do something bad, or something good, the same fatherless man sees all, even if nobody else does. you may be rewarded or punished accordingly, including after your death. * the fatherless man's virgin mother never died but \"ascended' bodily into heaven. * bread and wine, if blessed by a priest (who must have testicles),\" become' the body and blood of the fatherless man. similar nonsense is believed by muslims, hindus, jews, mormons, scientologists, all of whom think that the beliefs held by people of other religions are not only wrong but even absurd, despite the fact that there is no difference at all in the evidentiary basis for all of them. all of them have exactly zero credible evidence in support and whose only basis for belief is that they are found in ancient texts of dubious authenticity. i should point out that i attended a unitarian universalist church where such christian beliefs were laughed at. instead we were supposed to respect other forms of nonsense, so long as it was the non-standard, non-traditional nonsense. dismissing stuff such as healing crystals, \"wymen's way of knowing\" , godesses, dousing, etc. was a sign of being \"close minded\". possibly related posts: (automatically generated) notify me of followup comments via email \"previous | about blueollie this

last week president-elect barack obama asked congress to consider pushing back the dtv transition date. the consumer electronics association (cea) has responded. <mark>gary shapiro</mark>, president and ceo, offers alternatives to pushing back the deadline in a letter sent to obama transition team member co-chair john podesta. albeit a very polite one. in <mark>shapiro</mark>'s letter, which he says is on behalf of the 2,200 manufacturers and retailers represented by the cea, he makes it clear that his organization \"will support the new administration and congress to ensure a consumer-friendly dtv transition and implement any necessary changes .\" obama's point, articulated by podesta last week in a letter to congress, is that too many american's aren't ready for the transition. he cited the shortage of the commerce department's $40 dtv converter box coupons and contends that education of the transition has fallen short, especially with the \"most vulnerable americans .\" the cea, meanwhile, is \"sympathetic to concerns about disenfranchising consumers, especially the most vulnerable americans,\" <mark>shapiro</mark> writes. still, he adds, pushing it back \"has ramifications that should be considered .\" research showing that 95 percent of americans already prepared, many of which reacted \"because their government told them to do so .\" he points out that lots of consumers chose to subscribe to cable or satellite or purchased a digital tv because of the impending transition. pushing it back at this point would mean, <mark>shapiro</mark> indicates, that some consumers wasted their money - or at least spent money before it became necessary. \"a change in the date could engender skepticism, confusion and distrust the next time government asks them to undertake specific actions in anticipation of a major event,\" <mark>shapiro</mark> writes. additionally, <mark>shapiro</mark> offers the obama team and congress five alternatives to pushing back the date: a fix of the accounting issues such as the anti-deficiency rules that are preventing ntia from sending out coupons despite available funding. only 19 million of the 33.5 million available coupons have been redeemed. examine total funding for the coupon program and explore any need for additional funding, for example, to send coupons out via first class mail to eliminate three week delivery delays. elimination of the 90-day expiration date on coupons, which would put more coupons into use. explore additional funding for government call centers and funding to local grassroots groups to answer questions about the dtv transition. should the government determine that the supply of converter boxes will not meet demand, examine permitting use of converter box coupons to purchase access to digital television either through pay service (cable, satellite or fiber) or credit toward purchase of a limited feature or low cost digital television. subscribe to

from standing in one place for hours, i finally heard the words i never thought i'd hear a person of color say in my lifetime: \"i, barack hussein obama, do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states...\"well, at least it went sort of like that. president obama arguably pulled off the first bushism of his tenure while initially stammering through the oath. but in his defense, it was ridiculously cold and he was in front of almost 2 million people in one place; let alone the tens of millions watching around the globe. the occasional nervous stammer is expected. but i digress. one linguistic episode aside, this inauguration ceremony reflects one of the most important moments in the history of this country. this moment is directly defiant to the shameful years of our past and is a signpost for a promising future. people of all ages, races, and backgrounds gathered to watch this event unfold; an event which emphatically closed the door on america's once prevalent and adolescent mindset that only a certain kind of person could be president. now being ushering in is a new wave of hope and confidence. but now, it's the day after. the confetti has been swept away. it's back to work. for us to truly recognize the significance of the day and of this time in our history, a different type of thinking and practice is necessary. for starters, this event must make us more conscious of the shameful history paving the way for us to arrive at this point. the process for putting a man like barack obama in this position did not start with the inaugural ceremonies. it did not start with an impressive election day victory. it did not start with obama accepting his party's nomination for president. his propellant victory in iowa was not where the movement started. for that matter, not even obama announcing his intentions to run on that cold day two years ago began this process. these moments merely underscored a chain of events tracing back decades. the inauguration of president obama was a fulfillment of entire centuries-worth of anonymous people not remembered in history books, but who were crucial to what we are enjoying today. they suffered, fought, and died for an event in which they would never take part. we owe this all to them by honoring them using a multipronged approach. first as we commemorate this as a critical point in our nation's maturation, it is important that this does not simply become the period at the end of a sentence. i pray that as a nation we do not allow obama's election to become the impetus for complacency. while i am thrilled that america has finally opened its arms to the reality of a person of color, it was certainly not an unconditional acceptance. i've hinted before that weight of an unpopular predecessor was carried by the mccain/palin ticket; only to be magnified when the economy collapsed. at that point, an obama victory was almost inevitable. besides all of that, obama had to be a certain kind of candidate during his run. any endorsement of jeremiah wright's statements, for instance (comments on which i and most black people in this country actually cosign to some extent) would have spelled immediate defeat in a general election. though i suspect obama truly wanted to find solvency with the issue of race by parting from the discussion altogether, had he even wanted to engage in some of the difficult conservations about this nation and race relations, mccain would have no doubt been the man being sworn in yesterday. this reality underscores an important point: we have progressed significantly with race relations, but we still have a long ways to go. secondly, i think it is crucial that we not get so effusively sentimental about obama's victory that we forget to be critical of his performance. the overwhelming issues facing this nation are only temporarily absolved by this euphoric moment. poverty and economic hardships, violence, racism, homophobia, anti-intellectualism, and a host of other issues continue to be staples in the american structure. before victory can truly be claimed, these things must come to an end. what president obama does to address these things will be the ultimate measure of this moments' significance. in his defense, we tend to place blame on presidents without also recognizing the role congress plays. but with the supporting cast he has, president obama has a lot working for him. but if he cannot produce positive results during his tenure, we may only be celebrating the historic election of a captain on a sinking ship. of course, we cannot lay this all at the feet of obama alone. challenging him to be an effective leader must be met with our own self-imposed challenge to be better citizens. as citizens, we have an obligation to be equally as critical of obama's performance as we were of president <mark>bush</mark>'s. we must not be so enamored by the ceremoniousness of all things obama that we forget he's supposed to be our president. after all, we are fresh off the heels of a miserable decade in our political history that could have been avoided had we used sensible criticism of our president instead of mawkish adoration. this all demands that we not stay politically blinded until we vote again. this calls for something much greater than that. this leads me to my final point: we should not find ourselves in the position of resting on our laurels now that obama is officially president. instead of wasting this opportunity by accepting a docile and unassuming role in the change we are seeking, we should make a conscious decision to be involved. the time for excuses is over. the time for action is now. to be sure, a history-making inauguration of the first president of color makes the challenges we face no less difficult to surmount. but it should at the very least trigger a belief that we can face and defeat the obstacles we face daily. we can all be a little more motivated to healing this world. to volunteer. to improve our communities. to mentor our young. to reach out to the poorest and more marginalized among us. to exhibit the same pride and connection that allowed us to endure throughout the generations. our history has not culminated at this moment. if anything, this is only the next step in the process. possibly related posts: (automatically generated)", "articleID": "2009012204_00001317_W", "names": {"President Bush": ["Q207", "Q23505"]}}, {"date": "2009-01-22", "url":

capitalized on a first quarter fumble by cordera eason by capping a 61-yard drive with a 35-yard touchdown pass from graham harrell to edward britton. three plays later red raider free safety stepped

green and the rest of the ole miss defensive backs held crabtree to only four catches for 30 yards and a two-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter. harrell passed colt brennan to become the ncaa

the economy...washington (ap) - in a long-expected move, president barack obama plans to sign an executive order ending the ban on federal funds for international groups that perform abortions or provide information on the option, officials told the associated press on friday. liberal groups welcomed the decision while abortion rights foes criticized the president. known as the \"mexico city policy,\" the ban has been reinstated and then reversed by republican and democratic presidents since gop president ronald reagan established it in 1984. president bill clinton ended the ban in 1993, but president george w. bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in office. the policy bans u.s. taxpayer money, usually in the form of u.s. agency for international development funds, from going to international family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide information, counseling or referrals about abortion. it is also known as the \"global gag rule,\" because it prohibits taxpayer funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method. the democratic official and senior u.s. official who disclosed the plans did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to pre-empt obama's announcement. obama was expected to sign the executive order at a low-key event, one day after the 36th anniversary of the landmark supreme court ruling in roe v. wade that legalized abortion. the move was not a surprise as both obama and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton, who will oversee foreign aid, had promised to do away with the gag rule during the presidential campaign. clinton is to visit the u.s. agency for international development, through which much u.s. foreign aid is disbursed, later on friday. obama has spent his first days in office systematically signing executive orders reversing bush administration policies on issues ranging from foreign policy to government operations. but, save for ending the ban, obama has largely refrained from wading into ideological issues, perhaps to avoid being tagged a traditional partisan from the outset after his campaign promises to change \"business as usual\" in the often partisan-gridlocked capital. rather, obama has chosen to focus initially on issues in which there is consensus across the political spectrum and support from the public, such as closing the prison camp for suspected terrorists at guantanamo bay, cuba, to making government documents more accessible. in a move related to the lifting of the abortion ban, obama also is expected to restore funding to the u.n. population fund (unfpa) at his earliest opportunity, probably in the next budget. both he and clinton made this a campaign issue. the bush administration had barred u.s. money from going to the fund, contending that work in china supported a chinese family planning policy of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization. unfpa has vehemently denied that it does. organizations that had pressed obama to make the abortion-ban change were jubilant. \"women's health has been severely impacted by the cutoff of assistance. president obama's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and women dying from high-risk pregnancies because they don't have access to family planning,\" said tod preston, a spokesman for population action international, an advocacy group. anti-abortion groups criticized the move. \"president obama not long ago told the american people that he would support policies to reduce abortions, but today he is effectively guaranteeing more abortions by funding groups that promote abortion as a method of population control,\" said douglas johnson, legislative director of the national right to life committee. racist cookies: famed nyc bakery under fire for obama-inspired \"drunken negro faces' <mark>chris matthews</mark> shuts down reporter's discussion of caroline kennedy
