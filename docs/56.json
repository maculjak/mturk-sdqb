games to play. we will use this one to get us back in the ball game here and when we play south carolina on thursday .\" the tigers pulled down 17 offensive rebounds in the game, including 10 in the second half. auburn turned the rebounds into 13 second-chance points. \"that's a nice stat right there,\" said fortner. \"that definitely helped us to stay in the game early. it helped us confidence-wise. offensive rebounding is a confidence builder and it is an energy destroyer for the other team. when you are able to get on those offensive boards, it can really help you .\" keke carrier bobblehead day, led the tigers in rebounds, pulling down nine. greenleaf followed with seven boards, followed by chantel hilliard with six. \"every game i try and go in there and dominate,\"

georgia came out swinging in the second half, cutting the auburn lead, to 43-41, at the 15:44 mark. the tigers were able to rebuild their lead to nine with 7:38 remaining, compliments of a blanche

center of convergence. there's little question that the iphone has taken a bite out of sales of some standalone devices, notably navigation units and cheap cameras. but sony computer entertainment claims it has turned the tables on the iphone in the iphone's core gaming market: people purchase the iphone, enjoy certain games, and then get a sony psp to play it more fully. the iphone has become an on-ramp to sony psp sales, a sony executive says. wireless vs. wire line - what's right for your organization: download now five markets under siege, reports cio.com. | check out the gaming death match between the iphone and the sony psp .] \"we've seen a significant number of co-iphone and psp owners,\" says john koller, director of hardware marketing at sony computer entertainment. \"we don't view the iphone negatively in our sector. there's been more positive impact, in terms of attention turned to the handheld sector and the ability for consumers to graduate to psp after playing iphone games .\" just look at electronic arts madden nfl 10, the popular football game named after the legendary coach and television commentator, koller says. the 110 mb madden nfl 10 was one of the top games on the iphone deck when it came out on the iphone for the first time last fall for $10 (now selling for $7), whereas the 1.3 gb madden nfl 10 for the sony psp costs around $40. madden's iphone release was followed by strong sales for both madden on the sony psp and sony psp units themselves. \"it's a lag effect,\" koller says. as more and more big-name game developers target the iphone platform with sophisticated games, koller looks forward to new gamers seeking a richer gaming experience with the sony psp. this wasn't always the case. last year <mark>neil young</mark>, co-founder of iphone app game developer ngmoco and an electronic arts alum, said at the game developers conference in san francisco: \"don't let the haters tell you [the iphone] sucks compared to the ds or the psp. it doesn't. it's good .\" sony, which still views the iphone as a competitor, was also concerned about apple's penchant for pouring buckets of marketing dollars into the iphone, says koller. indeed, the iphone did become a strong gaming platform. last year, game apps, particularly role-playing ones, dominated the app store. for newer markets such as navigational devices, the iphone threatened to gobble up first-time customers who would have bought the standalone device. \"portable navigation devices are definitely under attack from smartphones with gps,\" gartner analyst van baker told cio.com in the article iphone apps: five markets under siege. \"the devices will have to get cheaper to remain viable, and that is not an attractive segment going forward .\" are you

(gulp!) smells of saints' bad old days white, a former usc and new orleans wide receiver (and a former times sportswriter), was with saints in 1987, when they ran a third-class program and were treated like second-class citizens around the nfl. lonnie white was a wide receiver/kick returner for usc from 1982-86, which included appearances in the rose, aloha and citrus bowls. in 1986, white established a single-season school record for kickoff return yardage (716 in 29 returns), a record that still stands. a former sportswriter with the times, he made the new orleans saints roster in the strike-shortened 1987 season. garrett hartley's game-winning field goal to give the new orleans saints a 31-28 overtime victory over minnesota in last week's nfc championship game was still in the air when the phone rang. on the line was my former saints roommate derrick taylor, who did not hesitate to ask me: \"how do you feel? are you happy for them?\" that's when it hit home. the new orleans saints, the onetime laughingstock nfl franchise that had paid my bills many years ago, were super bowl-bound. some might think 43 seasons is a long time to wait for a trip to the big game, but as a former employee...i didn't see it coming so fast. how in the name of jim mora, sam mills and <mark>dave wilson</mark> did that happen? taking a telephone trip down memory lane with taylor, we couldn't believe this was the same franchise that had given us so many laughs back in the day. well, laughs as in...\"someday we will laugh about this .\" from the team's outdated practice facility--which featured arguably the worst weight room in the league--to the undersized, brick-hard beds used for training camp, the saints were still considered a franchise joke when i joined the team as an undrafted rookie free-agent wide receiver in 1987. think burt reynolds' \"longest yard\" meets peter gent's \"north dallas forty .\" yes, these football movie \"classics\" are a good way to describe being an employee for the saints in the late 1980s. a collection of misfits, an incredibly awful setting, and stories more like a farfetched hollywood script than an nfl franchise game plan. after spending four seasons on the big stage in the coliseum as a member of the powerhouse usc trojans, the biggest surprise was to see how rundown the saints' facilities were. built in 1967 when the team joined the nfl, the building had more of a prison feel than that of a professional football facility. the paint on the walls was old, worn and dingy, and the place had a musty aroma that reminded you of past saints teams--it stunk. the practice fields weren't well-kept either. they were uneven, always wet and slightly muddy. most players complained, but the sloppy fields turned into a plus for me, thanks to fellow free-agent rookie quarterback erik kramer ., it was difficult to get quality repetitions as a rookie wideout, but when i did i was able to keep my footing on the muddy grass, unlike some of the faster wideouts. kramer, who eventually played 13 nfl seasons and still holds the chicago bears' single-season passing record, helped keep me with the team with his strong arm and accurate throws. when it was time to hit the weight room, the fields didn't seem so bad. \"i couldn't believe it when i first walked into their weight room,\" said taylor, who played three games as a replacement player for the saints in 1987 and then spent five years in the canadian football league. \"it was so small and smelled really bad. you would have to wait a long time in line just to bench press and there were always people rushing you .\" maybe that's why many veteran players owned memberships at local fitness gyms. think about that--nfl players working out at bally total fitness just to get in shape for the season. mora, in his second year as coach when i got there, was determined to get this team shipshape, despite the conditions. in fact, he turned the saints' lack of respect around the league into a rallying cry for his team. with two usfl championships under his belt and a roster filled with former players from the united states football league, mora went to work...and more work...and more work...despite temperatures that rose above 100 degrees for daytime practices at southeastern louisiana university in hammond, la., mora's workouts were unrelenting. he didn't care about the horrible facility or sleep conditions, or the fact that the lousy training-camp food wasn't helping the players' bodies to revive. finally, some of the veteran players talked to team owner <mark>tom benson</mark> about the food, and he hired a gourmet chef from north carolina who took special pride in his meals. this did not go over well with mora, who criticized some players for eating too much and thought that the high-end plates were making his team soft, not to mention fat. we all discovered how thin this club really was when the saints spent several days in wisconsin practicing against the chicago bears, who were still riding the success of their super bowl xx victory over new england. for the entire week, the saints were treated like a jv team compared with the bears, who were led by marquee players like walter payton, <mark>jim mcmahon</mark> and <mark>mike singletary</mark>. and we felt like one. when we arrived on buses and the fans discovered we weren't the bears, they would just walk away. guess they figured we were practice scrubs. people thought nothing of walking through our workouts and team practices. in town when people asked and discovered we were the saints, they would say: \"is there a player we would know?\" talk about humbling.", "articleID": "2010020208_00140334_W", "names": {"Dave Wilson": ["Q1173390", "Q14950791", "Q2494426",

appeared before a government committee today to call on the government to allow access to information relating to abortions performed in the province. the kelowna native, presenting to the special committee to review the freedom of information and protection of privacy act, called for the repeal of bill 21, an amendment to the province's freedom of information act that was enacted in 2001 by the ndp government to specifically exclude access to abortion information. as gerk told the committee, the bill \"created the amazing dilemma that i can know that my local hospital is providing abortion services, but i'm not allowed to know how many .\" in fact, as he pointed out, the abortion figures put out by statistics canada no longer include the number from b.c., and simply includes the note that the b.c. figure is \"too unreliable to be published .\" gerk charged that the amendment was enacted during a period when government was \"closely aligning themselves with political activists that lobby them on a regular basis,\" but \"then ensuring that information detailing that lobbying is never made public .\" the amendment, suggested gerk, was a way of covering up that information. prior to the passage of the amendment, information obtained through freedom of information, \"provided embarrassment after embarrassment directed toward the government and the bureaucracy,\" he added. through freedom of information requests, said gerk, he and fellow researchers were able to learn details about a special government committee called the abortion services working group, for example. they discovered that through this committee the ministry of health and the ministry of the attorney general were meeting with abortion-activist groups, and they also learned that freedom of information was a topic of discussion at these meetings. he mentioned, further, the discovery in the early 1990s that the b.c. attorney general had filed a false affidavit when he swore that he had not participated in a secret strategy meeting with abortion proponents. in 1996, said gerk, he and others discovered that the college of physicians and surgeons \"didn't even follow their own rules when it came to the accreditation of one of vancouver's abortion clinics .\" detailed in 2001, gerk was also able to discover, while investigating the death of a woman following an abortion at vancouver general hospital, that 15 babies had survived abortion between 1995 and 1998, but then died later. the amendment, gerk concluded, \"was put there, plainly and simply, because the government was tired of having to defend their abortion policies and activism. they were meeting with activists on one side of a public policy issue, all the while refusing to meet with those with a differing opinion .\" \"i didn't think it was too much to ask that we be allowed, in a democratic country, to monitor abortion advocacy being undertaken by our government and the bureaucracy,\" gerk observed. \"i mean, the same pro-choice groups that secretly met with government have called for a ban on any discussion about abortion and the formation of any pro-life groups, on university campuses!\" \"the public and media are surprised, now all these years later, at the travesty that foi has become in bc,\" gerk stated. \"i would submit that many of them failed to recognize that when you allow government to make any topic off limits, make it secret, you have in fact sown the seeds of secrecy...and how can you complain when it naturally expands to other areas?\" gerk and john hof, the president of campaign life coalition b.c., also called on the acting b.c. information and privacy commissioner, <mark>paul fraser</mark>, today to address this problem of abortion censorship. they
