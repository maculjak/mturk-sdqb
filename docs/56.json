Because he is currently shooting Mission: Impossible 6, Cavill grew an impressive mustache that would totally hide his identity as Clark Kent even more than his classic spectacles that somehow guard him from people recognizing that he actually is Superman. Because Justice League reshoots are underway, Cavill's schedule is quite hectic. However, Paramount Pictures is not allowing the actor to shave off his mustache despite his need to play Superman in Justice League. So instead of him shaving it off and having to wear a fake mustache for the rest of his work on Mission: Impossible 6, VFX artists on Justice League have to digitally remove his mustache for the footage used in the reshoots. Also read: \"Mission: Impossible' Director: Why\" Justice League' Star Henry Cavill Couldn't Shave Business Insider recently spoke with some VFX artists at The Mill regarding the process of digitally removing facial hair off of actors. As it turns out, that process is quite common depending on actors' involvement with other projects. Dave Fleet, head of 3D for The Mill discussed the process that may be utilized for Cavill's situation: \"Smoothing out tiny vellus hairs on the skin requires a totally different approach to removing a large volume of hair, like a beard or mustache. If we were to remove a beard we would have to digitally re-build the actor's face behind the hair mass. We would need to build a 3D model of the face and then shade the surface of the skin to look realistic. We would then need to track the 3D model to the movement of his head and potentially re-animate his mouth. The amount of lip animation would depend on how much of the original beard occluded his lips. We would need to paint out the parts of the beard that extend beyond his shaven face.\" Fleet also explained how long it will take to remove the mustache in post-production: \"One week just to make the 3D elements; then another three weeks to track, animate, and render the shaven face; and another two weeks to composite it all together.\" VFX artists are some of the most hard-working people in the industry. For one, putting together some of Hollywood's most exciting set-pieces is something to be lauded for. Also, their work on the effects one doesn't see immediately also deserves some praise. So yes, the removal of the Super-Stache is just as impressive as seeing the Justice League unite to fend off the Parademons. Talk about artistry.

While the story is famous for rebooting the DC universe before the New 52 initiative, the series is chop full of awesome moments. The book is full of awesome alternate versions of characters and emotional moments that ground the universe-changing story in a deeply personal core narrative. For those who don't know, Flashpoint follows what happens after <mark>Barry Allen</mark> travels back in time to save his mother on the night of her murder. When he returns to the present, he finds that everything he's ever known is different and he's even lost his powers. It might not be the perfect story to introduce people to the larger Flash universe, but I trust Geoff Johns. Hopefully now that the plot seems to be a bit more set, a director or directors (I'm looking at you Phil Lord and <mark>Chris Miller</mark>) will step onto the project soon and help mold it into something awesome. If Warner Bros. chooses to introduce an alternate version of the DC Extended Universe to the bigscreen, there's no one I'd rather explore it with than Flash. <mark>Barry Allen</mark> is the heart and soul of the DCU, so it's only fitting to watch him try and inject some light into a dark version of his home.

In 12 games against the Rangers this season, Seager is hitting .396 with 12 RBIs, five extra-base hits and a .646 slugging percentage. He is hitting .337 with a .667 slugging percentage against Texas over his four-year career. \"That's just one of those weird things,\" he said. \"That's baseball. I'd like to be able to do it against everybody.\" Seager drove in the Mariners' first three runs before scoring on left fielder Dustin Ackley's single in the eighth. Seattle starter Hisashi Iwakuma (5-3) allowed just one run off six hits over eight innings of work as the Mariners (34-35) snapped their five-game losing streak. In the hours before Sunday's game, Iwakuma didn't even think he'd be able to make the start. A sore neck hampered him throughout his pre-game stretch, so much so that a Seattle trainer had to be called in to loosen it up. \"I needed to pitch today,\" Iwakuma said after earning the win. \"I felt responsible, especially after (Seattle) losing five in a row, so I needed to go out there.\" Texas (34-35) got its lone run on a solo homer by <mark>Brad Snyder</mark> in the second inning, giving the Rangers a 1-0 lead. It was <mark>Snyder</mark>'s first career homer. \"I'm not going to lie: I've been working for that first big-league homer for a long time,\" said <mark>Snyder</mark>, the father of a young son whose own dad was watching the game on television back in Ohio. \"It is a big sigh of relief to get that first one out of the way. Especially on Father's Day, it's something I'll never forget.\" Seager, who already had a pair of singles, hit a two-out, two-run double in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 2-1. He added another RBI double in the eighth for a 3-1 lead before scoring on Ackley's RBI single. Seattle scored its final run on shortstop <mark>Brad Miller</mark>'s sacrifice fly in the eighth. \"We certainly weren't trying to give him anything on the inside of the plate,\" Texas manager Ron Washington said, \"and when we did, he hit it.\" Seattle did most of its damage against Texas reliever <mark>Robbie Ross</mark> Jr., who gave up three runs off four hits before rookie Ben Rowen came on for him in the eighth. Rowen, making his major league debut, got three outs in the eighth to end Seattle's three-run inning. Texas starter Nick Martinez (1-4) went six innings, allowing two earned runs off nine hits. Seattle first baseman Logan Morrison did not finish the game after suffering a laceration to his forehead in the fifth inning. Morrison slammed his bat into a dugout wall in disgust after a popout with two runners on base and took a shard of the broken bat off his left eyebrow. He underwent five stitches after the game. \"I obviously acted like a 3-year-old,\" Morrison said after the game. \"I apologized to my teammates and to (manager Lloyd McClendon)....I'm embarrassed. No matter how bad I'm playing, I can't do that. You move on, and hopefully I can come back soon and start helping this team win games.\" NOTES: Mariners C <mark>John Buck</mark> made his first career appearance at first base in Sunday's sixth inning, when he replaced 1B Logan Morrison after an incident in the dugout. Morrison cut a gash over his left eye when the bat he slammed against a dugout wall cracked and bounced off his eyebrow. <mark>Buck</mark> played flawless defense for three innings before being lifted for a pinch runner in the bottom of the eighth ....Texas CF Leonys Martin was back in the leadoff spot Sunday, marking the second game in a row and the third time this season that he has batted first ....Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon said before Sunday's game that OF <mark>Michael Saunders</mark> (shoulder), 1B Justin Smoak (quad) and DH <mark>Corey Hart</mark> (hamstring) are getting closer to rehab assignments. All three players are currently on the 15-day disabled list, with <mark>Hart</mark> eligible to come off whenever he's healthy ....Rangers 3B Adrian Beltre was initially slated to serve as designated hitter Sunday, but about 30 minutes before the game he changed positions with Donnie Murphy ....McClendon said the team still has no timetable for calling up RHP Taijuan Walker, who threw six innings of no-hit ball before giving up his only hit allowed in a 6 2/3 - inning performance at Triple-A on Friday night. Walker struggled with shoulder problems throughout the spring and early part of the season but appears to be getting closer to a clean bill of health.

CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The population of Lake Michigan's top predator fish was well balanced with its primary food source in 2017, according to an annual estimate released last week by fisheries scientists. The news helped boost confidence in the future of the chinook salmon fishery even as the species' key forage, the alewife, is historically low. The predator-prey ratio (PPR) on Lake Michigan was 0.058 in 2017, according to a report presented March 22 at the Upper Lake Committees Meeting of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The PPR expresses the balance between chinook and alewife. Higher numbers indicate more predators than desired for the available prey. The target is 0.05, with 0.10 the upper limit. From 2013 to 2016, the values were 0.09, 0.06, 0.51 and 0.56, respectively. \"Overall, it's somewhat positive and encouraging to see the PPR come down from levels of five years ago,\" said Nick Legler, fisheries biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and chairman of the Lake Michigan Committee's Salmonid Working Group. Legler presented the latest chinook information on behalf of the group, which includes fisheries personnel with state agencies in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, American Indian tribes, Michigan State University, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Geological Survey. The data included creel survey information, annual forage assessments by acoustic and bottom trawls and fish examined at weirs.

In 2016, the Lake Michigan Committee of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission recommended a 62% chinook stocking reduction to help stave off a potentially serious imbalance. In the five years preceding a collapse of the chinook fishery in Lake Huron, the PPR averaged 0.11. Chinook stocking has been reduced multiple times over the decades in response to disease issues and declines in the forage base. The most recent cut was in 2013. But many anglers, including charter captains and members of the Wisconsin Lakeshore Business Association, pushed back in 2016 and convinced the Wisconsin DNR to keep chinook stocking level. Cuts were made instead to plants of brown trout and lake trout. The 2017 assessment of one annual benchmark--weight of a 3-year-old female chinook salmon--made it clear the fish were in good condition last year in Lake Michigan.

Visit on Facebook The data were obtained from 931 chinook gathered at seven spots around Lake Michigan, including the Root River in Racine and Strawberry Creek in Sturgeon Bay. . The 2017 lakewide average weight of a 3-year-old female chinook was 17.8 pounds, a 0.6 pound decrease from 2016 but 5.8 pounds higher than 2015. Significantly, the 2017 weight was 2.3 pounds higher than the long-term (1986-2017) average of 15.5 pounds. The most recent PPR and average chinook weight information validated observations of many Lake Michigan charter captains. \"That's the kind of the data I was expecting based on what I see on a day-to-day basis on the lake,\" said Jason Woda, 43, of Oak Creek, who owns and operates Reel Sensation Charters in Milwaukee. \"Many of us feel like there is more bait out there than the surveys have shown and that the fish are in good shape.\" Woda also serves as secretary of the Wisconsin Lakeshore Business Association, \"There was talk about cutting 500,000 chinook just a couple years ago,\" Woda said. \"That would have put a lot of ports out of business. We said we didn't want an increase, but let's put the brakes on any plans to cut chinook. This recent data shows that was a good decision.\" Chinook are not native to the Great Lakes but were introduced to Lake Michigan in the 1960s to help control nuisance levels of alewife, also a non-native species. Chinook are highly valued by anglers for their sport and table value. In Wisconsin, annual chinook stocking peaked at 2.7 million in 1989 and in recent years was 1.5 million in 2004, 1.17 million in 2006, 724,545 in 2008, 1.23 million in 2010, 1.18 million in 2012 and 823,222 in 2014, according to DNR records. A freshly caught Chinook salmon hauled in by Wendy Morris flops around on the dock in Port Washington. (Photo: <mark>Mark Hoffman</mark>, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) The most recent plans call for keeping chinook stocking in the 800,000 s. Managing the lake's trout and salmon fishery is complicated by natural reproduction of chinook, primarily in streams in Michigan. In recent years, about two-thirds of chinook sampled lake-wide were wild, or naturally reproduced, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Chinook are watched closely since they consume the most prey fish in the lake and rely most heavily on alewife. In 2017, chinook consumed 47 kilotonnes of forage fish, compared to 21 for steelhead, 19 for lake trout, 8 for brown trout and 4 for coho, according to the report. The recent data and estimates have helped allay fears that a Lake Huron-like collapse was imminent on Lake Michigan. Fisheries scientists will continue to keep a close eye on the lake, however, and caution that year-to-year swings can be substantial. Legler pointed out that the lake's alewife biomass is at a record low, PPR is slightly above target and there has been a slight upward trend over the last three years. \"The goal is to sustain the great fishery that's out there,\" said Brad Eggold, WDNR Lake Michigan fisheries manager. \"It's clear management actions have helped in the past and we're committed to working with our partners and stakeholders around the lake to continue that into the future, too.\" Top Headlines from Sports: Ji-Man Choi is a surprise on the Brewers' opening day roster Bevy of topics on minds of Packers' <mark>Mark Murphy</mark>, NFL Chase Anderson evolved into complete starter CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE"}, {"articleID": "2019062615_00159068_W", "names": {"Jeremy Hunt": ["Q333533", "Q929730"]}, "date": "2019-06-26", "url": "http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/national/17731985.scottish-conservative-leader-backs-jeremy-hunt-to-be-next-pm/", "content": "Scottish Conservative leader backs <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> to be next PM By Press Association 2019 Ruth Davidson 0 comment Ruth Davidson has announced she is backing <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> in the Tory leadership contest.

That is why we recently announced a new \u00a3 6m Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund.\" Alongside the Skye strategic group, the Scottish government will continue to do all we can to support sustainable growth in tourism, working in partnership with local communities - in Skye, throughout the Highlands & Islands and across Scotland. \"\"Too much to bear' Julie Burnett, a director of MCHA, said:\" This is a key milestone in the project to provide improved parking facilities close to the Fairy Pools. \"The community benefit of the land transfer and the overall project cannot be overstated.\" Both residents living in Glen Brittle and future visitors to the Fairy Pools will benefit from the proposal to expand and improve the existing small car park. \"Ms <mark>Forbes</mark> said a\" robust \"tourist strategy was needed for Skye as a whole to improve infrastructure.\" The situation at the Fairy Pools has really become too much to bear for local residents who just want to go about their daily lives, \"she said.\" The single-track road is far too narrow for the volume of traffic parked at the Fairy Pools. \"We've reached a point where enough is enough and I'm pleased the Scottish government is facilitating the community asset transfer at the Fairy Pools.\" She said she had begun a series of meetings to draft a strategy for the island. \"Tourists are welcome on Skye, it's our responsibility to ensure the infrastructure is prepared for them,\" she said."}, {"articleID": "2017102421_00640749_W", "names": {"Ricardo Perez": ["Q1334974", "Q28976377", "Q30122668", "Q5485794"], "Stephen Davis": ["Q3498537", "Q7609026", "Q7609027"], "Walter Koenig": ["Q376176", "Q42832997"], "Ron Howard": ["Q103646", "Q19874445", "Q3940969", "Q4883"]}, "date": "2017-10-24", "url": "https://geektyrant.com/news/full-trailer-for-netflixs-stretch-armstrong-and-the-flex-fighters-animated-series", "content": "Full Trailer For Netflix's STRETCH ARMSTRONG AND THE FLEX FIGHTERS Animated Series Trailer TV Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters Netflix about 35 minutes ago by Joey Paur Netflix has released a full trailer for their upcoming animated series Stretch Armstrong and The Flex Fighters.

Johns' first day will be July 1 at the start of the district's new fiscal year. Johns is currently superintendent of West Chicago School Dist. 33, but has experience in both elementary and high schools, working his way up from teacher and debate coach at Township High School Dist. 214's Elk Grove High School, to dean, assistant principal, principal, assistant superintendent and superintendent in Dist. 214, Elmhurst Community Unit School Dist. 205 and Dist. 33.

(Tom Robb/Journal photo) Asked why he came to Dist. 225, Johns said, \"The Glenbrooks are widely known as one of the finest districts in the entire country. This would be the pinnacle of any educators career.\" Riggle spent more than 20 years working for Dist. 225, starting as Glenbrook North High School principal in 1998 before replacing Supt. Dave Hales in 2008. In September, BWP & Associates was hired to conduct a national search for Riggle's replacement. After pre-screening dozens of candidates, seven potential candidates for the position were identified, including Johns, which were narrowed to three finalists. Those three finalists were interviewed extensively by both school board members and a group of key district stakeholders in December. Charles Johns, hired to replace the retiring Glenbrook High School Dist. 225 Supt. Mike Riggle July 1, chats with an old friend, Dist. 225 Teachers Union President Matt Whipple at Monday's school board meeting. The two taught a summer debate program at the University of Iowa years ago. (Tom Robb/Journal photo) Although school board members voted to approve a contract for Johns at Monday's (Feb. 11) school board meeting, district officials said Johns' salary and contract details would not released until minutes from Monday's meeting are approved by school board members at their next meeting. \"After meeting with many outstanding candidates, Dr. Johns emerged as our finalist because of his systematic approach to providing an equitable education to students,\" said Board President Skip Shein. Johns said his first task will be to learn the organization and build relationships within Dist. 225. He said his process for addressing issues is to, \"be as thoughtful as possible getting a broad view.\" He said understanding any legal issues along with hearing community input is also important to his process. Johns holds a doctorate in educational leadership and policy studies from Loyola University and bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa in teaching.

The 44-year-old had been widely tipped for the role following his impressive displays throughout the tournament, with New Zealand legend Grant Fox actually breaking the news on Sunday - albeit unofficially. Owens, who was named \"Gay sports personality of the year\" in 2007 shortly after coming out, has won admirers on and off the pitch for his light touch and humour, as well as his rapport with the players. \"This is a huge honour and a privilege for me,\" Owens said on Monday ahead of what will be his 68th test. \"I am humbled to have been chosen. This is my third World Cup and I think it has been the best. It has been inspirational. The quality of rugby on display has been incredible in front of packed venues and so to be given the opportunity to referee the final match between the best two teams in the tournament is an amazing honour.\" I would like to thank World Rugby and the Welsh Rugby Union for their support over many years. There have been so many individual people throughout my career who have helped and supported me along the way and while I can't name everyone here, I will be thanking everyone personally in due course. \"I want to thank my friends and family for their ongoing support and for helping me through some rough times in my life.\" My dad, in particular, is always there for me and is delighted with this news--it's just a shame my mother is not here to see this as she was a pillar of strength for me. She passed away six years ago and I know she would have been very proud. \"Jerome Garces of France and England's Wayne Barnes will be the touch judges with Shaun Veldsman of South Africa taking the role of television match official.
