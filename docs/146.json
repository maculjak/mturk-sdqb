"by <mark>james patrick</mark> special to the press herald portland - the look on stefhon hannah's face said it all. three minutes into the third quarter, hannah was smiling as he ran down the court

maine red claws never found a way to wipe that smile off his face as hannah's dakota wizards took a 122-100 win thursday night at the portland expo. hannah finished with 30 points in 30 minutes of play. he hit 8 of 12 3-pointers, leading maine's kenny hayes to question his team's defense after the game. \"he's good, but we scouted them and he's a shooter,\" hayes said. \"you've got to get a hand in his face. we didn't force him to put the ball on the floor and drive. it's like coach (dave leitao) talks to us about what to do and we get out here and we're clueless .\" the red claws (12-20) certainly were at a loss for how to slow the wizards (15-14). six dakota players scored in double figures, including marcus dove's 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting. <mark>tommy smith</mark> had 16 points, also on 8-of-16 shooting. leitao wasn't happy with the defense, though he wouldn't condone hayes' criticism of the red claws. \"i don't know if i'd say clueless,\" leitao said. \"number one, it's about effort and number two, it's about trust, trusting that your teammate's going to be there for you. the funny thing about it is when we have days where we practice, not a day goes by where we don't spend 40 or 50 percent of the time working on defense .\" nothing went right for the red claws on thursday. dakota led 9-0 two minutes into the game. when the wizards went up 25-10 with 4:49 remaining in the first quarter, the red claws never again pulled within single digits. dakota's 122 points tied for the second-most points allowed by maine this year. though the 22-point margin was not the biggest of the season, dakota led by as much as 33 points several times in the third quarter. leitao could only speculate as to why defense is so hard to come by in the d-league. part of it, he said, was that players think they have to score big numbers to get noticed by nba teams, not play defense. \"a lot guys in this league have been major scorers in college and all the way along,\" he said. \"they're all used to scoring .\" morris almond had 30 points to lead maine's offense. hayes had the second triple-double in team history, with 19 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. not bad for a 6-foot-1 point guard, but hayes was definitely not in a celebratory mood. \"i think it's my first one since high school,\" he said. \"i definitely feel like it showed my all-around game. it just (stinks) i can't celebrate it with a win .\" it was hannah who did all the celebrating thursday. here at pressherald.com we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by

beau bai's run in saturday's betfred grand national trial at haydock. after getting off the mark for the campaign in a chepstow handicap chase in early december, the nine-year-old returned to monmouthshire to secure welsh national glory in bottomless ground. with the emphasis sure to be on stamina again over three and a half miles on merseyside, <mark>lee</mark> feels le beau bai has plenty going for him as he bids to land a race in which he has finished third for the past two seasons. \"le beau bai has been fine since his win in the national, absolutely perfect,\" said <mark>lee</mark>. \"it can't be soft enough for him so the ground at haydock will be a big plus .\" he only went up 9lb for winning, which seems fair enough, you can go up that for winning a little race. \"seven lengths back in second in the welsh national was giles cross, filling the runner-up spot in the chepstow feature for the second year running. victor dartnall's charge is slightly better off at the weights with le beau bai this weekend and the trainer believes there will be little between them. dartnall said:\" he's in very good form, but it's not going to be easy beating le beau bai. \"he will enjoy the testing conditions and going up for chepstow was not the end of the world .\" that said, le beau bai has gone up 9lb so it will be very tight. \"i imagine denis (o'regan) will ride him positively. we are hopeful of a good run .\" heading the weights is the paul nicholls-trained neptune collonges, a horse who has competed in four runnings of the cheltenham gold cup. the 11-year-old has twice run well in the blue riband behind esteemed stablemates kauto star and denman and conditional jockey harry derham, who gets the leg up this weekend, feels he heads to haydock with solid claims. he said: \"the trip is right for him, which could be the main thing .\" three and a half miles looks ideal nowadays as he's been staying on over three in his races this season. \"his mark has dropped down a little from the start of the season and you'd like to think he had a good chance in a race like this .\" he looks fantastic and we've done plenty of work at home. \"hopefully his three runs have put him spot-on for this .\" next in the handicap is <mark>john wade</mark>'s pride and joy always right, who impressed on his seasonal return at kelso, but was a big disappointment when sent off favourite for the rowland meyrick chase at wetherby on boxing day. \"he's really well and i'm looking forward to a nice run from him,\" said <mark>wade</mark>. \"he had a bit of a virus on him later after he ran disappointingly at wetherby on boxing day .\" the run was too bad to be true so there had to be something there. he's in good fettle now. \"rey nacarado runs from out of the weights, but is still considered a major player by his trainer, charlie longsdon .\" we're 5lb out of the handicap so we've got that to find, but we think he is an improving horse, \"he said .\" he's improved all his career and even from earlier on this season. it is a big pot and it's a big prize go for. \"he's a good each-way price and he'll be nearer the top of the betting than the bottom .\" malcolm jefferson's king fontaine has won twice at the track and has slipped back down to his last winning mark following some disappointing efforts. he is set to go off a big price this weekend but jefferson would not be surprised to see his nine-year-old run a huge race. \"one of these days he's going to win a big race,\" said the norton-based handler. \"i really fancied him at haydock last time but he didn't jump well and it was a bit disappointing .\" he's done that twice with dougie (costello) now, so whether he doesn't get on with him, i don't know. \"we've done a lot of schooling with him and if he runs to his best form, he'd have a hell of a chance .\" fantasy f1----------------------------------------------------------------", "articleID":

chiefs depth chart, including quarterback, wide receiver, offensive line and defensive line. some of these will be upgraded in free agency and the draft, but others will look the same as they did last season. one position that is sure to see change is at running back. with rbs <mark>thomas jones</mark> and jackie battle free agents and jamaal charles coming off acl surgery, there is a clear need for a runner. many believe the team will draft a back at some point to complement charles. meanwhile, others expect a free agent - specifically benjarvus green-ellis of the patriots - to go to kansas city. the team also could opt bring back battle, along with fb le \"ron mcclain to aide the rushing attack .\" i think it's another solid class, \"gm scott pioli said of the running backs available in the draft .\" there are a number of underclassmen making it another solid class of running backs. i think overall, the entire draft, it's a really solid class all along. \"the chiefs led the nfl in rushing in 2010, gaining 164.2 yards per game. much of that came from charles, who had a record-setting season in leading the team to first place in the afc west. however, last season, when charles went down with an acl tear in week two and <mark>jones</mark> struggled to get much going, the running game as a whole underperformed. kansas city finished 15th in the league at 118.3 yards per game, an issue the team wants to fix this coming season. pioli told reporters at the nfl scouting combine he believes that charles will return to health next season, but that depth at the position is still vitally important .\" i'm a firm believer that even when you have good starters - i think jamaal is a very good starter and hopefully coming back healthy from the injury - you can never have enough good players or depth, \"he said .\" whether we address it in this draft or in free agency, i think it will be, \"where does opportunity meet our needs?'\" battle, who has tremendous value on special teams, is expected to re-sign. we hear <mark>jones</mark>, who turns 34 in august, won't return and might retire. head coach romeo crennel said the chiefs would like to bring back mcclain, who did well as a lead blocker during his first season with the team. pro football weekly, llc. | 302 saunders rd. suite 100 riverwoods, il 60015 | (847) 940-1100 copyrighted? 1998-2012 by pro football
