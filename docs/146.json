Yet the administration paired that move with a surprising announcement that it had decided not to punish anybody--for now--under new sanctions retaliating for the election-meddling. Some U.S. lawmakers accused President Donald Trump of giving Russia a free pass, fueling further questions about whether the president is unwilling to confront America's Cold War foe. Known informally as the \"Putin list,\" the seven-page unclassified document is a who's who of politically connected Russians in the country's elite class. The idea, as envisioned by Congress, is to name-and-shame those believed to be benefiting from Putin's tenure just as the United States works to isolate his government diplomatically and economically. Being on the list doesn't trigger any U.S. sanctions on the individuals, although more than a dozen are already targeted under earlier sanctions. Prime Minister <mark>Dmitry Medvedev</mark> is among the 114 senior political figures in Russia's government who made the list, along with 42 of Putin's aides, Cabinet ministers such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and top officials in Russia's leading spy agencies, the FSB and GRU. The CEOs of major state-owned companies, including energy giant Rosneft and Sberbank, are also on the list. So are 96 wealthy Russians deemed \"oligarchs\" by the Treasury Department, which said each is believed to have assets totaling $1 billion or more. Some are the most famous of wealthy Russians, among them tycoons Roman Abramovich and Mikhail Prokhorov, who challenged Putin in the 2012 election. Aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a figure in the Russia investigation over his ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, is included. The Trump administration had until Monday to issue the list under a law passed last year. After declining to answer questions about it throughout the day Monday, the Treasury Department released it with little fanfare 12 minutes before midnight. Even more names, including those of less-senior politicians or businesspeople worth less than $1 billion, are on a classified version of the list being provided to Congress, officials said. Drawing on U.S. intelligence, Treasury also finalized a list of at least partially state-owned companies in Russia, but that list, too, was classified and sent only to Congress. There was no immediate comment early Tuesday from the Kremlin or the Russian Embassy in Washington. In the works for months, the list has induced fear among rich Russians who are concerned that it could lead to U.S. sanctions or to being informally blacklisted in the global financial system. It triggered a fierce lobbying campaign, with Russia hawks in Congress pushing the administration to include certain names and lobbyists hired by Russian businessmen urging the administration to keep their clients off. The list's release was likely to at least partially diffuse the disappointment from some lawmakers that Trump's administration opted against targeting anyone with new Russia sanctions that took effect Monday. Under the same law that authorized the \"Putin list,\" the government was required to slap sanctions on anyone doing \"significant\" business with people linked to Russia's defense and intelligence agencies, using a blacklist the U.S. released in October. But the administration decided it didn't need to penalize anyone, even though several countries have had multibillion-dollar arms deals with Russia in the works. State Department officials said the threat of sanctions had been deterrent enough, and that \"sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed.\" \"We estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions,\" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. She did not provide evidence or cite any examples. Companies or foreign governments that had been doing business with blacklisted Russian entities had been given a three-month grace period to extricate themselves from transactions, starting in October when the blacklist was published and ending Monday. But only those engaged in \"significant transactions\" are to be punished, and the United States has never defined that term or given a dollar figure. That ambiguity has made it impossible for the public to know exactly what is and isn't permissible. Late last year, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said one reason the U.S. was proceeding cautiously was that major U.S. allies have much at stake. Turkey, a NATO ally, has a deal to buy the S-400, Russia's most advanced air defense missile system. And key security partner Saudi Arabia recently struck an array of deals with Moscow, including contracts for weapons. It was unclear whether either country had since abandoned those deals to avoid running afoul of the U.S. sanctions. New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, lambasted the move to punish no one, saying he was \"fed up\" and that Trump's administration had chosen to \"let Russia off the hook yet again.\" He dismissed the State Department's claim that \"the mere threat of sanctions\" would stop Moscow from further meddling in America's elections. \"How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that's already underway?\" Engel said. \"It just doesn't make sense.\" ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman

countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties on goods from china and other \"non-market economies\" after a court ruling struck the practice down. three against one the rare earths dispute is one of several between beijing and the other three economic powers, as chinese industry remolds the world economic order. the dispute is the first to be jointly filed by the european union, the united states and japan. though dependent on the outside world for vast qualities of industrial inputs such as iron and coal, china accounts for about 97 percent of world output of the 17 rare earth metals. they are crucial for the defense, electronics and renewable-energy industries and are used in a range of products such as mobile phones, disk drives, wind turbines and electric cars. \"china continues to make its export restraints more restrictive, resulting in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace,\" u.s. trade representative ron kirk said. the action over china's export curbs involving rare earths, as well as tungsten and molybdenum, begins a 60-day process for the two sides to try to resolve the dispute. if unsuccessful, the next step would be for the united states, the european union and japan to ask the wto to establish a dispute-settlement panel to decide the case, which with appeals could take as long as two years. \"china's restrictions on rare earths and other products violate international trade rules and must be removed,\" european union trade commissioner karel de gucht said in a statement. \"these measures hurt our producers and consumers in the eu and across the world, including manufacturers of pioneering hi-tech and\" green' business applications. \"environmental defense beijing said the export curbs are necessary to control environmental problems caused by rare earth mining and to preserve supplies of an exhaustible natural resource.\" we regret their decision to complain to the wto, \"china's minister of industry and information technology <mark>miao wei</mark> said, according to the official xinhua news agency.\" in the meantime, we are actively preparing to defend ourselves. \"china's export quotas were not trade protectionism and did not target any specific country, he added. the eu, the united states and mexico won a similar case against china in january concerning other raw materials. but a european official close to the case said despite this ruling, china had not removed wider export restrictions. in particular, the eu said in a statement,\" the latest rare earth quota announcements are further tightening the restrictions and are a clear signal in the wrong direction. \"beijing has until the end of march to tell the united states, the eu and mexico how it intends to comply with the january ruling, providing an opportunity for china to address both that case and the rare earth restrictions at the same time, a senior u.s. administration official said. foreign companies pay up to twice as much as chinese firms for rare earth metals, the eu says.\" these restrictions...benefit chinese industry, \"the official said.\" therefore they are against wto rules. \"the eu directly imports 350 million euros worth of rare earths from china each year, and also brings in products of far greater value containing rare earths from japan and elsewhere. the damage done to european manufacturing runs into billions of euros, the official said because it was nearly impossible to diversify from chinese supply. china said its export policies stemmed from environmental concerns, but failed to prove its curbs helped conserve resources, cut pollution or improve public health in that case, the eu said. trade spats trade friction between the eu and china has been growing. de gucht said on a recent visit to hong kong that china needed to be sensitive to perceptions that its economy is a threat in europe, even as eu-china trade has boomed to almost 400 billion euros in 2010. eu complaints against chinese dumping range from shoes to kitchenware, and de gucht has previously complained that china subsidizes\" nearly everything \". meanwhile china, along with the united states and russia, recently complained about an eu plan to levy a carbon emissions charge on all airlines using eu airports. china has said it would not buy aircraft from european maker airbus because of the emissions scheme. japanese worries over supplies of rare earths heightened in 2010 when china held back shipments after a territorial dispute. in the united states, obama recently created a new inter-agency trade enforcement center, is expected to start work in the coming months with a focus on chinese honoring of wto rules. the obama administration is also considering a wto complaint against anti-dumping and retaliatory duties on u.s. auto exports that china imposed late last year.

It remained conditional on approvals from the Western Australian, Australian and Chinese governments. \"The Channar joint venture is one of Australia's most significant trading partnerships and has helped pave the way for the incredibly strong relationship we have forged with China today,\" said Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury. \"This extension represents another milestone in our 30-year partnership that has seen more than 250 million tonnes of iron ore delivered from the Pilbara to China.\" The original Channar joint venture was signed in 1987 and provided for the production of 200 million tonnes of iron ore. Rio Tinto said the third extension would increase the life of the joint venture to cover production totalling 290 million tonnes.
