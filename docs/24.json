on may 15. story: vatican calls it harmless story: <mark>howard</mark> accuses vatican of obstruction (cbs/ap) \"angels & demons,\" a much anticipated sequel to the enormously successful \"the da vinci code,\" opens today, and in what may be a prelude to box-office gold, the <mark>dan brown</mark> book on which it is based shot to the top of the bestseller lists this week. in adapting another of author <mark>dan brown</mark>'s religious-mystery page turners, director <mark>ron howard</mark> wisely gave in to its beat-the-clock thriller elements, which makes for an enjoyable summer movie experience. besides <mark>howard</mark>, the key players are back from that 2006 international hit, including tom hanks as harvard professor and symbologist robert langdon and akiva goldsman as screenwriter (with david koepp collaborating on the script). joining them are ewan mcgregor, stellan skarsgard and armin mueller-stahl. skarsgard says he's no big fan of <mark>dan brown</mark>'s writing and accepted a role in \"angels & demons\" only after reading the script based on <mark>brown</mark>'s book. i think <mark>dan brown</mark> is a terribly bad writer, but he has cliffhangers after every chapter which makes you continue reading, \"skarsgard told swedish broadcaster svt .\" it's like eating peanuts at a bar. you don't like them, but you keep on eating them anyway, \"he said. the swedish actor, who plays the head of the pope's swiss guard in the movie, said director <mark>ron howard</mark>'s script was significantly different from the book .\" angels & demons \"is better than the first film, skarsgard said in the interview aired late wednesday, because\" the story is more simple and straightforward but just as dramatic. \"although\" angels & demons \"preceded\" the da vinci code \"in book form, the film is positioned as a sequel to take advantage of the strained relationship between langdon and the vatican - only this time, it's his expertise the folks there reluctantly need. with the pope dead and the college of cardinals about to meet in conclave to choose a replacement, a secret society known as the illuminati has kidnapped the four likeliest candidates. langdon is brought in to decipher clues at various churches and historical sites throughout rome to prevent the killing of the cardinals, one every hour, leading to a bomb explosion at the vatican. in bestseller lists released thursday,\" angels & demons \"was at the top of publishers' weekly list of mass market paperbacks and number 10 on usa today's fiction list. the brouhaha over\" the da vinci code \"has long since abated among catholics, albinos and\" code \"purists, although <mark>howard</mark> did try to reignite the controversy earlier this month when he claimed in interviews that the vatican tried to block him from filming parts of the sequel in rome. as for the critics, many appear to like this film better than it's predecessor, which earned $77 million in domestic ticket sales and $224 million worldwide in its opening weekend. in his sunday morning review, david edelstein says <mark>howard</mark> does a hundred times better with\" angels & demons \"than\" the da vinci code. he says, \"this movie is shapely and stylish and very, very scary - and hanks has much better hair!\" ", "articleID": "2009051519_00035048_W", "names": {"Dan Brown":

looser regulations makes it a growth market for payday loan providers such as money mart. from barack obama to congress to state legislatures, there seems to be a groundswell of support to regulate the payday loans industry in the united states and lower fees charged to customers. there are 15 states that already effectively prohibit payday loans through caps on interest rates for small loans. others are considering similar legislation. not so in canada. nearly two years after the federal government turned over regulation of the industry to the provinces, some of the highest fees in north america have been approved, all in the name of consumer protection. the new payday loan landscape has been greeted warmly by u.s. companies, which are looking at trying to expand their share of the $2-billion annual market in canada. it has left consumer advocates disappointed and asking why loans under $1,500 have been exempted from the maximum interest rates allowed under the criminal code. \"canada is going in the opposite direction,\" said john lawford, counsel for the public interest advocacy centre in ottawa. \"it is disappointing that the federal government washed its hands .\" since the legislative change in 2007, several provinces have announced regulations that will require the industry to be licensed and more transparent about its fees and which attempt to restrict some lending practices. the most contentious area remains the maximum fees that will be permitted. four provinces so far have decided on fee caps that will take effect later this year. ontario and british columbia are permitting total fees of well over $60 for a typical $300 loan to be repaid in 14 days, at a time when interest rates are at historic lows. the fees are nearly 15 times what a credit card company would charge for a cash advance over the same time period. an independent regulator in nova scotia approved maximum fees of $93 per two-week $300 loan, an annual percentage rate (apr) of interest of more than 800%. it is the second-highest rate in north america, with b.c. and ontario close behind, of the jurisdictions that regulate the fees that can be charged (six u.s. states do not have caps on fees). the average cost in regulated states is about $45 for a $300 loan. as well, there are ways \"to do an end-run\" on some of the restricted practices, such as rollover loans, said mr. lawford. some companies offer a \"back-to-back\" loan, depositing money into a customer's account and charging new fees, as soon as the previous pay cheque clears. it is only in quebec where the maximum annual interest rate for any loan is 35%, that there is no payday loan industry. in the rest of the country, the new rates might be considered a form of stimulus for payday lenders. the pennsylvania-based parent company of money mart noted \"there are significant opportunities to grow our business in canada,\" in its latest quarterly financial report, which talked of \"pruning\" operations in the united states. advance america, the leading payday lender in the united states, is turning its attention north of the border. \"we look at canada as an opportunity. canada is a good place to be. we just want to let the legislative process play itself out,\" said spokesman jamie fulmer. when british columbia and ontario announced its new rates this spring, both provinces presented the news as consumer focused. \"ontario protects payday loan users\" said a release issued by the government of dalton mcguinty. not stated was the fact that the new rates are higher than money mart, by far the largest payday lender in the province, was already charging. the allowable fees are also greater than previous money mart charges that are at the centre of a class-action suit against the company, now at the trial stage in ontario superior court, nearly six years after the legal action was initiated. harvey strosberg, lead counsel in the money mart lawsuit, suggested ontario moved too quickly. \"we believe the government made a fundamental policy error in deciding the issue before this trial is over and all the evidence is in about the ways these companies really work,\" said mr. strosberg. last week, cash store financial announced a $14-million settlement in a class action over past fees in b.c. that were about the same rate it will be permitted to charge there in the future (new class actions are unlikely now that the industry is exempted from the criminal code interest rate laws). the ontario government \"is trying to strike a balance\" to protect consumers and \"to ensure the industry continues to exist,\" said sarbjit kaur, a spokeswoman for harinder takhar, minister of small business and consumer services. while she stressed the rate caps set out only the top fee permitted, consumer advocates point to the u.s. experience, where maximum rates are what most companies charge. this view was echoed in a 2007 policy paper published by the consumer protection services division of the ontario government. \"it is fair to say that the maximum rate has become the only rate,\" in the united states, noted the policy paper. the profits made by the industry have been exaggerated, countered stan keyes, president of the canadian payday loan association. as well, a provincially regulated industry is the best way, he said, to provide a service to people who need small, short-terms loans. \"do we want people going to pawn shops, bouncing cheques or going to the pool hall to borrow from some unscrupulous person,\" asked mr. keyes. the stark choice between a regulated industry with high fees and the pool hall loan shark is a false comparison, said byron williams, of the manitoba public interest law centre. \"the scare stories have not been proven,\" he stated. an independent board in manitoba imposed fees of $17 per $100, the lowest in the country, after a full regulatory hearing. the provincial government has since taken control of the rate setting process and introduced legislation this spring that should result in $17 as the maximum charge, with a sliding fee scale downward for loans over $500. \"the process has been transparent,\" said mr. williams, \"with the benefit of a fully participating consumer .\" five provinces have yet to set maximum fees. but there has been little talk of u.s. style regulation in any of them. exclusive: a

halt of financial elder abuse and other abuse san francisco - california is a prime target for financial abuse as the nation's highest retirement destination with an estimated 4.9 million people over 65-years of age living in the golden state in 2003. that same population is expected to jump to more than 9 million by 2020. financial-related abuse of seniors is exploding. reports of financial exploitation of the elderly has increased 150 percent within the past 10 years with monetary losses estimated to be several billion dollars annually, according to jenefer duane, founder and ceo of the elder financial protection network. an estimated $4.8 billion dollars of california's seniors' assets are at risk, according to duane, one of the senior advocates at the gene friend recreation center may 7 who came out in support of ab 768, an anti-elder abuse bill that will amend california's penal code establishing emotional, physical, and financial abuse committed against a senior or dependent adult as a crime throughout the state. ab 768 will strengthen california's penal code making it easier to investigate and prosecute crimes against seniors by eliminating the required proof of knowledge of someone's age or dependency status or the definition of caretaker; allows evidence of abuse as sufficient proof; and it establishes strict penalties in order to be charged with elder abuse. within the first few months of this year the san francisco police department has received more than 100 cases involving financial abuse of seniors, san francisco chief of police heather fong said. in 2008, the police department received more than 400 cases of financial-related abuse involving seniors. additionally, the police department has received more than 40 cases of reported elder abuse this year. in 2008, there were more than 240 reported cases of elder abuse, fong said. it is important for seniors and those who care about our elderly population to report elder abuse, especially suspected financially-related abuse, as it is underreported, especially financial elder abuse, according to a. <mark>alan kennedy</mark>, assistant district attorney and manager of the elder abuse unit of the san francisco district attorney's office. duane, assemblywoman norma torres (d-pomona), who authored ab 768, san francisco district attorney kamala harris, and senior advocates are calling californians to action to protect the state's elderly-especially when so many of our elders are unwilling to report crimes against them. \"elder abuse is a crime. make no mistake. it must be reported and it must be stopped...we owe it to you to do everything we can to protect you,\" duane told seniors gathered at the center. she urged them to tell their friends about the bill and to report suspected incidents of abuse. seniors who are victims of financially-related abuse are more likely to be institutionalized and the mortality rate of seniors who are abused is three times higher than that of seniors who do not experience abuse, according duane. it's important for seniors and those who care about our elders-a treasured asset of our families and communities-to support the passage of ab 768, that will amend california's penal code establishing emotional, physical, and financial abuse committed against a senior or dependent adult as a crime throughout the state. this bill is unique in that it recognizes acts of fraud, theft, embezzlement, forgery and other financially-related crimes as a form of abuse that can leave seniors in financial ruin at a stage in their lives when they should be enjoying the fruits of their labors. \"an elder who has lost their life's savings cannot go back to work and regain what they made their entire life. this affects an elder's ability to remain independent in their home and can result in early and unnecessary institutionalization placement in a nursing home,\" said duane. the community is joining together to be a \"loud voice in support of our seniors,\" harris said. \"the current elder abuse statutes are as about solid as swiss cheese,\" harris continued. \"[we want to] make sure that we have the teeth in this statute to take a bite out of those crimes and send those offenders where they belong .\" torres added, the law will \"make it easier to protect seniors as we protect our children,\" who need to be respected, should be taken care of, and should be protected from abuse, she said. this entry was posted on thursday, may 21st, 2009 at 12:31 pm and is filed under uncategorized. you can follow any

which bills its memorial day parade as the largest in the midwest - the annual celebration begins at 1 p.m. sunday. this year, the parade route is jefferson from nine mile to 11 mile roads. st. clair shores councilman matt ahearn, who also serves as parade president, said the grand marshal this year is randy milbocker, district manager for blossom heath inn banquet center. ahearn also said regardless of the economy, it's important to take time out to salute area veterans. \"we have to do this even though it's a tough year for businesses,\" ahearn said. \"this day is for our veterans who have sacrificed so much for us. it's a must .\" motorists will have a break for the weekend on area roads and highways as the michigan department of transportation will suspend work and open as many restricted lanes as possible, said mdot spokesman rob morosi. \"whatever we can open, we are, but some things such as the mound bridge over i-696 is out, so those won't be open,\" morosi said. the mound road interchange exits will remain closed, but closed lanes on i-696 between hayes and i-94 will be open. some lane restrictions will continue on the gratiot road project between 14 mile and remick, and again between 21 mile and 23 mile roads. the following are comments from the readers. in no way do they represent the view of macombdaily.com. we encourage your feedback and dialog and ask you to follow a few simple guidelines when commenting on stories on macombdaily.com. 1) please post responsibly. 2) be polite. 3) don't hate. 4) if you object to someone's post, use the \"report abuse\" button and we'll review it. red wings live blog -
