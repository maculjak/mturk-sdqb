umaine report summarizes findings and recommends goals february 19th, 2010 contact: jonathan rubin at (207) 581-1528 <mark>joe carr</mark> at (207) 581-3571 orono - an exhaustive year-long study of economic, safety and environmental issues related to clearing maine's roads has yielded a report from the university of maine's margaret chase smith policy center. the report, developed in cooperation with the maine department of transportation (mainedot), involved university experts in economics, engineering, public administration and environmental sciences. it shows improvements in managing winter storm transportation issues over the past decade and recommends a series of steps aimed at reducing costs, limiting the negative environmental impact of chloride-based chemicals and improving public safety. prof. jonathan rubin of the umaine school of economics and margaret chase smith policy center is the report's lead author. he says that the implications for long-term state and municipal planning are significant. \"because of its rural nature and vast territory, maine must address some particularly difficult issues when dealing with transportation during the winter months,\" rubin says. \"by bringing together stakeholder groups and carefully examining available data, we've determined that our state and municipalities do an excellent job managing these issues and we've developed a road map for even more effective processes and procedures in the future.\" some of the report's key findings: \u2022 in the aggregate, maine spends an estimated $98 million annually on winter road snow and ice control ($76 per resident); this includes some sidewalks and school parking lots and funding sources include the state, municipalities and the maine turnpike authority \u2022 the estimated 490,000 pounds of rock salt purchased in maine during 2008-2009 represent 750 pounds per resident or 21 tons per road mile \u2022 maine has 23,450 miles of public road, the most in new england; mainedot maintains 18 percent of that total \u2022 all chloride salts contribute to vehicle and infrastructure corrosion; none is shown to cause more corrosion than another \u2022 between 1989 and 2008, there has been a significant reduction on the number of fatalities on state highways; at the same time, the number of vehicle miles traveled in maine has been increasing (except during the past two years) \u2022 drivers ages 16 and 17 are involved in nine percent more winter-condition crashes than their share of crashes under other road conditions; drivers ages 18-34 are also involved in more winter crashes, but not to the degree of 16 - and 17-year-olds \u2022 long-term environmental effects of road chemicals are apparent along maine roadways; new policies are needed to encourage the use of chemicals and technologies with less environmental impact the report notes that chloride salts are currently the best and most affordable tool maine has to use for winter road maintenance but that they take a toll on the environment, infrastructure and vehicles. while the variability of conditions around maine makes it impossible to apply one solution in all instances, the report says that there are \"advances in technology and practice which can lead to reduced costs and reduced salt use.\" one recommended focus area relates to a move from deicing to anti-icing. the former involves spreading sand and salt after snow has accumulated, the latter is a preventative process currently used effectively by mainedot, the maine turnpike authority and some maine municipalities. \"anti-icing and pre-wetting policies,\" the report says, \"have been shown to result in reduced plowing time, a reduction in abrasives us, a decrease in total chemical use, and decreased maintenance costs.\" those processes can help the state address cost issues, corrosion and environmental impact. in addition to its key findings, the report contains a series of goals that the state and municipalities should address: \u2022 maintain safety while reducing salt and sand use \u2022 identify efficiencies to maximize the budgetary impact of improvements \u2022 reduce salt use \u2022 increase public awareness of preventative measures \u2022 increase driver safety education \u2022 increase public awareness of winter practices, costs and environmental impact rubin also notes that the study involved an extensive review of current practices in other northern states and in canadian provinces. here. the university of maine, founded in 1865, is the state's premier public university, located in the town of orono. it is among the most comprehensive higher education institutions in the northeast and attracts students from across the u.s. and more than 60 countries. it currently enrolls 12,000 total undergraduate and graduate students who can directly participate in groundbreaking research working with world-class scholars. students are offered 88 bachelor's degree programs, 64 master's degree programs, 25 doctoral programs and one of the oldest and most prestigious honors programs in the u.s. the university promotes enviornmental stewardship on its campus, with substantial efforts aimed at conserving energy, recycling and adhering to green building standards in new construction. for more information about the university of maine visit you can follow any responses to this entry through the"}, {"articleID": "2016052807_00072750_W", "names": {"El Toro": ["Q5428175", "Q767616"]}, "date": "2016-05-28", "url": "http://northjersey.com/arts-and-entertainment/how-big-is-too-big-some-theme-park-riders-fear-small-seats-and-the-walk-of-shame-1.1606731", "content": "& copy; 2016 North Jersey Media Group May 28, 2016, 3:00 AM How big is too big? Some theme park riders fear small seats and' the walk of shame' STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS | Wire Service It's an uncomfortable scene familiar to anybody who has ever visited a theme park, including North Jersey-area amusement parks: The overweight rider becomes increasingly embarrassed as the ride attendant pushes and shoves with all his might on the over-the-shoulder restraint that stubbornly refuses to click closed. Everybody waiting in line knows what comes next: the \"walk of shame.\" Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times Buckling in on the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride at Universal Studios, Hollywood. \"The walk of shame is an embarrassing experience,\" said Mike Galvan, who penned the \"Big Boy's Guide to Roller Coasters.\" \"I've been there many times. It's disheartening.\" For instance, Galvan likens the straight back and flat seat on Universal's new Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey attraction in Hollywood to an \"old wooden chair\" that provides little wiggle room for larger riders. \"When the over-the-shoulder restraint comes down, if part of you is hanging over, whether it be your gut, your thighs or your shoulders, you're going to be very uncomfortable,\" Galvan said. While there are no height or weight maximums for Forbidden Journey, the safety restraints must be able to close properly for guests to ride, Universal officials said. Like many theme park attractions, Forbidden Journey has a tester seat near the entrance for visitors who might be worried they won't fit on the ride. But as big and tall riders will tell you, those tester seats often can be misleading. \"I do not trust the accuracy of the test seats, no matter the park,\" Galvan said. \"I can only suspect that the seat belts on the test seats are intentionally short to minimize the potential of riders getting the\" walk of shame' at the station. I've also had the opposite happen, where I made the test seats but was rejected from the actual ride. \"Galvan, 31, is a regular contributor to SFGAmWorld, a fan site for Six Flags Great America outside Chicago. In 2007, he was so overweight that he stopped going to theme parks because he no longer could fit on the rides. Over the next three years, he lost more than 130 pounds so he could return to his passion: roller coasters. Anybody who has ever been kicked off a ride because he or she was too big will tell you that theme park attractions are not designed for people who are heavier or taller than average. All theme parks have euphemistic names for those who are too fat or too tall to fit safely in an attraction seat--\"exceptional sized riders\" or \"guests of larger size,\" for example. Some ride makers even try to make accommodations with \"big boy seats.\" So how big is too big? At Six Flags Great Adventure & Safari in Jackson, there are no set maximum measurements for riders, as each ride has different types of restraints, a spokeswoman said. But the Safety & Accessibility Guide on the park's website also warns, \"Due to the design of the seating safety device on this ride, exceptionally large or tall people may not be able to ride\" for a number of popular \"high thrill\" rides such as Batman: The Ride, El Diablo, <mark>El Toro</mark>, Green Lantern, Kingda Ka, Nitro, Runaway Mine Train, Superman: Ultimate Flight, The Dark Knight and The Twister, though most of these have test seats in front of the ride's entrance for guests to see if they will fit before attempting to get on the ride. The Bizarro coaster also has \"a special seat in Row 5 of each train to accommodate guests with larger body proportions,\" the site says. Similarly, at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pa., each ride has different height and weight limitations. However, guests approaching 300 pounds may have difficulty on a number of roller coasters, aerial and swinging rides, according to Laura Woodburn, director of ride operations. As at Six Flags, many of these rides have a test seat at the front of the lines and a sign at the entrance reading: \"This ride may not accommodate guests of a larger size (height and/or weight) due to the configuration of the safety system.\" The signs allow guests to make a decision about whether to ride prior to waiting on line and, Hersheypark hopes, prevents guests from being \"embarrassed or disappointed,\" Woodburn said. Cedar Fair, the parent company of Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif., and 10 other amusement parks, offers very specific size requirements for \"guests of larger size.\" Cedar Fair warns that men over 6 foot 2 inches or 225 pounds with a 40-inch waistline or 52-inch chest \"may not be accommodated on some of our rides.\" The park operator says women over 200 pounds who wear a size 18 or larger could have trouble fitting on some rides. At Ohio's Cedar Point, some coasters such as Millennium Force, Top Thrill Dragster and GateKeeper have a 6-foot-6-inch height maximum. Ohio's Kings Island institutes height maximums for a number of rides, including Firehawk (6-foot-9), Invertigo (6-foot-6) and Delirium (6-foot-4). Tennessee's Dollywood has 6-foot-6-inch height maximums on a number of rides, including the Wild Eagle wing coaster. The Green Lantern: First Flight at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif., has a height maximum of 6 foot 5 inches. Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Virginia sets aside two rows of seats on the Alpengeist and Griffon coasters for riders with \"chest measurements exceeding 52 inches.\" Splashin' Safari water park at Holiday World in Indiana uses a walk-on scale to ensure the maximum weight on the six-passenger Mammoth rafts doesn't exceed 1,050 pounds. Disney parks have no height or weight maximums on any attractions, according to officials. Disneyland famously replaced the 1964 boats on It's a Small World because the increasing waistlines of Americans were causing them to run aground--an assertion reported by MiceChat and vigorously denied by Disney officials. Theme park officials typically respond with prepared statements when asked about making accommodations for \"riders with unique physical attributes\" (such as this one from Six Flags): \"We work closely with ride manufacturers to incorporate safety systems that are designed to accommodate people of average physical stature and body proportions. We require that all seat belts, lap bars and shoulder harnesses be positioned and fastened properly. Because of the rider restraint system, guests of a larger size may not be accommodated on some rides.\" As has been well documented, Americans are getting fatter. The average weight for adult men has risen from 166 pounds in 1960 to 195 pounds in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average weight for women increased from 140 to 166 pounds during the same period. Addressing the issue is complicated for ride makers in part because every rider carries weight differently--with problem areas ranging from the hips, waist and stomach to the chest and shoulders. For big riders, coaster \"rideability\" varies from park to park. One of the biggest concerns for larger riders is what Galvan calls the \"seat belt lottery.\" \"It's absolutely amazing how from one row to another, the length of the seat belt will vary,\" he said. \"The only reason I can think for this irregularity would be off-season maintenance. Some rides are more egregious than others in this department.\" Older coasters by Arrow Dynamics and Schwarzkopf tend to be the easiest to ride for larger riders, according to Galvan's \"Big Boy's Guide to Roller Coasters.\" Some Bolliger & Mabillard rides can be tight fits, while others offer rows with larger seats, Galvan said. Vekoma, Gerstlauer and Mack Rides typically present few problems, while Premier and Intamin often prove difficult for bigger riders, he said. Intamin's suspended launch coasters such as Wicked Twister at Cedar Point and Volcano at Virginia's Kings Dominion cause the most problems for big riders, he said. \"The issue with these rides is the seat belt and the lack of an audible\" click' when pulling the restraint down, \"Galvan said.\" Not to mention that you have the seat several feet off the ground, so you have to tippy-toe or jump up to get into the seat. Depending on your body dimensions, you might not be able to maneuver yourself to get into the seat properly. \"There are no industry standards among ride makers and amusement parks when it comes to accommodating bigger riders. Some parks require two locking clicks to secure a lap bar or over-the-shoulder restraint on a ride, while others insist on three clicks. Seat belt lengths can vary from ride to ride and row to row.\" Most manufacturers, if not all, hoping to do business in the U.S. are now offering optional \"jumbo' seats to buyers to fit larger adults,\" said Bob Dean of Florida-based Leisure Labs, which represents Mack Rides, Great Coasters International and Mondial.

"and now for a riddle: what is big, loud, unnecessary and costs $75 million? no, not a retired elephant in a diamond-studded dress: the answer is, of course, a group of 20 summit. these g-20 meetings--younger, chubbier cousins of the equally pointless g-7 and g-8 summits--have been going on since 1999, in an under-the-radar kind of way, but lately they have taken on a new urgency. indeed, the next one, in london on thursday, is being widely billed as the one that will rescue the international economic system, provoke a stock market rally, create lasting prosperity and save the politicians present from the disgruntled voters protesting outside. and all of this in a single day! yet the truth is that nothing that will be discussed at the summit, and nothing that will be discussed at any of the follow-up summits, could not also have been discussed on the telephone. or by e-mail. or on a skype conference call. indeed, one british writer suggests that \"the world's leaders should have followed their usual platitudes about looking to the future and engaging the young by holding the whole thing on facebook.\" the purpose of this summit, like all such summits, is not really discussion. it is politics. but then, the purpose of this summit, like all such summits, is not really discussion. it is politics. from the hosts' perspective, the primary purpose is to rescue <mark>gordon brown</mark>, the british prime minister, whose popularity is at record lows. <mark>brown</mark> spent the years between 1997 and 2007 serving as britain's chancellor of the exchequer--the equivalent of america's treasury secretary--and thus cannot, like his american counterparts, blame britain's financial crisis on the mistakes of the previous administration. he took credit for britain's booming economy during those years and is being held responsible for britain's unusually deep recession: for weeks now, the british press has been howling for him to \"apologize.\" if nothing else, those official summit photographs--<mark>brown</mark> surrounded by the leaders of america, china, russia, argentina, against the grim, industrial background of london's isle of dogs--will make him feel important again. others have different agendas, none of which entail much real discussion either. the obama administration, for example, hopes to use the summit as a tool to bludgeon the germans and others into spending more money: they want each country present to commit 2 percent of its gross domestic product to a stimulus package, creating a sort of family support structure for the gazillion-dollar american stimulus package. this would, in theory, allow our president, too, to go home and declare victory. and if it doesn't happen, at least he'll have a culprit when the international economy does not fix itself within a month or two: it will all be the fault of the europeans, who--typical continentals!--dither, dissemble and squabble among themselves instead of rallying to the american call. while i am usually the first to accuse the europeans of dithering and dissembling, i actually have some sympathy for the germans on this point. the reason they, the french and many others in europe--the british are an exception--have avoided spending large amounts of money on their economy is not that they are incompetent continentals. it is because they do not think it will work. strange though it may sound, angela merkel, the german chancellor, and nicolas sarkozy, the french president, are leaders who, for better or for worse, came to have some respect for what used to be called anglo-american capitalism, with what used to be its reputation for fiscal conservatism. more to the point, they are also running up against the limits of what they can borrow and are worried about inflation as well. this latter worry is even more acute in many smaller european countries, some of which are actually cutting their budgets and introducing financial austerity packages as a result. though these policies aren't popular now, their advocates might well be proved right in the end. there is an analogy, here, albeit an unfortunate one, to the recent past. after sept. 11, 2001, the bush administration, instead of fixing al-qaeda, afghanistan and pakistan for good, decided to invade iraq. the europeans balked--and those who didn't, such as the british, are now sorry. after the banking crisis, the obama administration, instead of regulating the banking system and the mortgage market, decided to devise a massive stimulus package, build a lot of bridges, expand educational spending and maybe fix health care, too. the europeans are balking again. will those who aren't, such as the british, be sorry a few years from now, too? at least if that happens, this week's g-20 summit will take on genuine importance. it won't be just another summit, producing another pile of documents, containing another bunch of euphemisms but, rather, will be a turning point. it will be remembered forever as the moment some of the rich world headed off in one direction and the rest headed off somewhere else. which might mean it has been worth at least a portion of that $75 million. related article on capitalism and trust by applebaum related article on protectionism in global trade by applebaum how to fix medicare: let's pay patients, not physicians

strikes came in and around houston. some other regions, including texarkana, were also hit. the destruction caused by doomsday led to an influx of refugees not only from texarkana, longview and other military targets, but from the destroyed cities of dallas and fort worth in the north and houston and galveston from the south. effects from fallout, starvation and fighting over scarce resources led to a reduction in population to a mere 360,000 people bythe fall of 1984. the surviving city-states, notably tyler, college station and nacogdoches, alternately fought each other for remaining resources and worked with each other to secure said resources. it became clear to everyone that cooperation, not fighting, provided the region's best chance of survival. on may 8, 1989, the 13 remaining city-states agreed to join as the\" republic of texas \". their standard of living had reverted back to a 19th-century level, as people were unable to restart power plants damaged on doomsday or in subsequent fighting. from 1989 to 1992, scouts were sent into the dallas, texarkana, houston and waco regions to see if anyone else had survived. scouts returned from the houston and texarkana areas reporting no signs of life and\" massive \"devastation; scouts assigned to dallas and waco never returned. when houston scouts died of radiation-related causes, the political leaders called off all subsequent expeditions. one unauthorized attempt into western texas was made in 1995; the scout's written records was found amongst his remains west of waco by the first west texas army-led expedition into eastern texas (the army has said it will release the records to the public, but has yet to do so). efforts continued at restarting the power plants, eventually paying off in january 1996, when what is now called the central nacogdoches power plant was restarted. engineers at texas a & m and stephen f. austin universities were able to build working radios, enabling the region to monitor radio stations out of mexico, puerto rico, cuba...and west texas. once the situation in western texas was ascertained from radio monitoring, eastern texas officials debated on whether to send scouts into the region. mindful of the earlier failed expeditions into the dallas and houston areas, officials eventually called off scouts, and instead debated, and agreed, upon an unorthodox strategy: announce the nation's existence to the known world via radio. on may 8, engineers got a transmitter for one of the nacogdoches radio stations working, nearly 13 years after doomsday. further tests saw the station's reception gradually increase from a 1,000-foot radius from the transmitter to covering nacogdoches, then reaching into tyler and college station. edit]

of texas governor bertis matlock was held at the main theater in downtown nacogdoches. much of the press conference was spent detailing the histories of the two republics, but it was announced that the two countries had signed a treaty including provisions for medical and infrastructure aid from west texas and its allies, as well as talks to determine the future\" political \"relationship between the two parties. the conference was briefly interrupted by a heckler - a locally known comedian - who yelled twice from the back of the theatre\" where the hell were you west texans all this

west texas army personnel assigned to eastern texas for a six-month period. homesteaders about to set up camp outside van horn, 1987 a sheriff's deputy from palestine in east texas. the texas state constitution was adopted as is when the towns confederated, and the governmental structure was initially established on as much of the pre-doomsday state model as possible. the governor's mansion is a private residence near the stephen f. austin university campus in nacogdoches donated to the republic after confederation. the legislature meets on the sfa campus, as officials decided there was not enough manpower nor material to build a new state capitol building. other state agencies have their offices either in downtown nacogdoches, or on the sfa campus. politics are dominated by the successors to the pre-doomsday democratic and republican parties. the republicans tend to be conservatives appealing to the large southern baptist base in the region and make up roughly 60 percent of registered voters. democrats, making up 34 percent of voters, are found mainly in the capital of nacogdoches and in college station and have a more liberal, progressive view of social issues. abortion and homosexuality are two issues the democrats have pushed in recent years. independents make up the other 6 percent of voters, and tend to reject both the perceived (and real) far-right and far-left extremes of both parties. farming, ranching and cotton have been the biggest industries in the nation since confederation. though they will continue to play a big role in the local economy, it is anticipated that oil and natural gas production will ramp up significantly in the next couple of years. the east texas oil field, one of the biggest such fields in the pre-doomsday united states, has been dormant since 1983. tests by mexican and west texas petroleum companies are ongoing to see how much oil is there, and how many barrels of oil the basin could export over the next 25-50 years. west texas and mexico also hope to develop the abundant natural gas fields in the region. in 2010, west texan and mexican economists and officials are looking for ways to pour money into the region. they recognize that most people will need job training in the new, 21st-century economy that the two countries are trying to develop in eastern texas, and they will need to be able to earn money. the challenge is how to develop a strong middle class, and not have a third-world nation perpetually dependent on heavy government aid and private charity assistance. it is hoped that oil, natural gas, cotton, farming and ranching, along with lesser industries like the rose-growing industry being redeveloped in tyler, will provide a solid base for a strong eastern texas economy. barter became the de facto system right after doomsday and, until the reunion with west texas, persisted as the only way to trade and obtain goods and services. over the years, there were various attempts to establish a monetary-based economy. the longest-lasting was from 1994 to 2000, when the government pushed the u.s. dollar, and then the texas dollar, as the monetary standard. even then, nearly everyone used barter in some form or another. the texas dollar was abandoned in 2000. currently, the west texas dollar and mexican peso are the two currencies in use in the region. there had been no organized military in the country until its reunion with west texas. the biggest threats to the republic came from criminals and roving gangs of bandits, and those were dealt with by local law enforcement. the police departments for all 13 towns had an agreement to work together when necessary, and there was a provision in the eastern texas constitution for a draft of all able-bodied men in case of invasion. west texas military has a presence in east texas and is currently working to establish some sort of army for the nation. some observers believe the east texas army will be, if not in name, then in practice part of the west texas military. local law enforcement in each town is led by a sheriff, voted in by citizens, and responsible for appointing, oversight and training of deputies and other officers. in nacogdoches, college station and tyler, a police chief oversees the department, and regional deputies handle the duties a sheriff would in smaller towns. the texas rangers of eastern texas were responsible primarily for the protection of the governor and his family. their duties are currently being expanded to be more reflective of their west texas counterparts. the texas baptist convention, headquartered in nacogdoches, has by far the largest religious presence in the nation. an estimated 58 percent of citizens belong to tbc churches, and the tbc has long been active in national politics. the roman catholic diocese of eastern texas is the second-largest religious body in the nation, making up an estimated 28 percent of citizens. the diocese takes a neutral stance in regards to politics, but members have been known to side with the tbc-led\" conservative movement \"or with progressives. many hispanics are catholic, as the church has been part of their families for several generations. other protestant denominations and sects - pentecostalism in particular - make up 8 percent of citizens. 2.5 percent profess to be atheistic or agnostic, 1 percent have\" no religion \"and .5 profess other religions, specifically judaism, taoism and buddhism. sports in the so-called republic of texas (a group of small city states in the eastern portion of former texas) was described by a west texas military soldier as\" what might be if you took modern sports and transported them back to the old west. \"american football is played as it was pre-doomsday, although the type of ball the locals have been able to manufacture have forced the sport to become more of a running game than a passing game. helmets are a hybrid of leather with facemasks made out of copper, iron or other metals. baseball also is played as it was pre-doomsday, although the ball is more\" dead \"(which has cut down on home runs); home plate is made out of wood; and batting helmets are made out of cast iron, with primitive, cotton-based padding inside. association football, known as soccer in the region, is the third most popular sport. observers from west texas and mexico were surprised at the high level of play in the primary amateur league, and especially by the talent of midfielder clint dempsey, a nacogdoches native. the famous radio station at 860 am, with the call letters kvrt (ksfa pre-doomsday), now operates seven days a week, from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. local time. it broadcasts a mix of news, sports, talk shows, religious programming, music (primarily country), as well as comedies, dramatic programs and soap operas. west texas radio is working to establish three more stations in the region by spring 2010, and up to ten by summer 2011. telephone service has been established between midland and the governor's mansion in nacogdoches; west texan and mexican companies aim to have all government agencies wired by the end of 2009 and service to all 13 towns restored by fall 2010. the daily sentinel, based in nacogdoches, is the nation's newspaper of record. two universities reopened in the years after doomsday: stephen f. austin university in

Since she's taken the helm, The Times whopping four in 2013 alone - and oversaw the prestigious newspaper's breathless coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings, all points that his in-depth profile of Abramson. But amidst the 3,000-word longread, one point stuck with readers and other new sources: Jill Abramson admitted to crying after receiving bad press. Turbulence at The Times, \"a scathing account of Abramson's\" stubborn \"and\" condescending \"temperament, bolstered by the comments of one anonymous Times employee who described her as\" impossible, \"listing example after example of her abrasive, take-no-prisoners attitude. The article prompted backlash from media elite like <mark>Emily Bell</mark>, who criticized the sexist undertones of the Politico article: For every anonymous source anxious to talk about Abramson's mood swings, and absences, there could have been a counterbalancing one to talk about how Abramson is more present on the news floor than a number of her predecessors. For every person who talks about the exhausting nature of her management style, there is another who might point out that the news operation is the strongest it has been for a long time. You might even find people who think there is more than a whiff of sexism apparent in the building, and the critiques. None of this, however, feeds the story of a woman in charge who tells people what to do in a manner they don't like. In The Daily Beas t in-depth, Abramson admits she cried after reading the article:\" I cried, \"Abramson tells me.\" I should say it went right off me, but I'm just being honest. I did cry. But by the next morning, I wasn't completely preoccupied by it anymore. I had my cry and that was that. \"For Abramson to admit she cried is bold. She was lucky that her brief show of emotion wasn't in front of a crew of cameras, as was the case for Hillary Clinton in 2008. Her reaction, in the privacy of her own home, to an article that amounted to a personal attack is more than appropriate. And her admitting some tears after the accusation that she was an ineffective leader was a minor point in an article that otherwise examined Abramson's leadership style from a holistic point of view. But you can trust that the public won't let an example of a woman in the position of power shedding some tears go without mention. Dr. Kim Elsbach of the University of California has studied the repercussions of crying in the workplace, and found that\" The worst offenses...are crying in a public meeting or because of work stress, like a looming deadline or coworker disagreement, because it is considered disruptive and weak. Crying in a private performance evaluation is also considered unprofessional and often manipulative. \"New York Magazine in particular has ran with the Jill Abramson Cries and It's News story: read,\" New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson is not going to pretend she doesn't feel feelings, if only for a moment. \"Another highlight of the profile? An anecdote of Abramson curtly informing a maintenance worker to wait for her to finish her interview with The Daily Beast before carrying away tables and chairs for an event.\" It's a balancing act, and she appears to be pulling it off, \"finished the NYMag piece. A balancing act between what? Being a bitch on one hand and a sensitive woman on the other? The only thing worse than The Bitchy Corporate Woman trope is The Bitchy Corporate Woman Also Cries trope. From The Daily Beast profile, it's clear that Abramson falls into neither. She's an effective editor with certain aggressive personality traits necessary to be at the helm of one of the world's most respected news sources. She led her staff through layoffs, additional replies submitted and awaiting review"}, {"articleID": "2018111216_00464894_W", "names": {"Steve Russell": ["Q16195304", "Q2634274", "Q30122065", "Q42277880", "Q43388452"]}, "date": "2018-11-11", "url": "http://newsok.com/politics-monday-voters-send-more-women-to-state-capitol/article/5614727?custom_click=rss", "content": "Politics Monday: Voters send more women to state Capitol by Ben Felder Published: Sun, November 11, 2018 3:47 PM Updated: Mon, November 12, 2018 10:35 AM shares email Advertisement Kendra Horn, D, Congresswoman-elect for the House, district 5, Friday, November, 9, 2018.

An on-air personality at Heart & Soul 92.1 and Power 103.5, Nice had been handling off-air duties since filing for office. Asked Thursday whether letting Nice go was related to her being elected, Russell Perry, chairman and owner of Perry Publishing & Broadcasting, said, \"No, it's just that we've taken a different direction.\" Commutation requests headed to governor's desk Gov. Mary Fallin now will decide whether to reduce the prison sentences of 22 individuals who received favorable recommendations from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board last week. Michael McNutt, a spokesman for Fallin, said the commutations likely will reach the governor's office in the next two weeks. (Story continued below ...) Asked whether Fallin plans to act on those 22 cases before leaving office in January, McNutt said: \"It is a priority of Governor Fallin to act on pardons, paroles, and commutations to get them processed as expeditiously as possible so that a backlog is not left for the next administration.\" Rural vote helps get Stitt to governor's office Gov.-elect Kevin Stitt won the election for Oklahoma governor last week by 12 percentage points, a wide margin of victory that surpassed most expectations and indicated the enthusiasm behind Stitt, especially in rural communities, was greater than expected. \"Right now, that sea of red is still outweighing the islands of blue,\" said Bill Shapard, CEO of Shapard Research, speaking about the concentration of Democratic votes in the state's two largest cities, surrounded by Republican support across rural Oklahoma. Democrat Drew Edmondson's largest vote totals came from Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and he even made some headway in the Oklahoma City suburbs, winning dozens of precincts in Edmond that had long been Republican strongholds. But the urban vote wasn't enough as rural Oklahoma showed its continued relevancy in statewide races. On Sunday, I had a story in The Oklahoman that took a closer look at Stitt's rural support and why both campaigns thought he did so well.

One place you won't be seeing them any time in the future, though, is Steam. In fact, Valve's <mark>Erik Johnson</mark> believes that while it would boost revenue, implementing ads in the Steam PC storefront would be detrimental to the whole platform. \"We don't see a case for that ever getting user value,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said in a GameSpot interview. \"I don't think that those ever work, either.\" <mark>Johnson</mark> went on to say that \"it would be a bad business decision, let alone just dumb\" to introduce ads to the storefront, believing it would ruin their customers' experience. This customer-oriented approach seems in-line with other recent company moves, such as Valve's promise to refund any games purchased on Steam. According to <mark>Johnson</mark>, the company would rather \"focus on long-term relationships.\" Valve's <mark>Robin Walker</mark> agreed, and re-iterated that one of the company's primary goals is to help users searching for games amidst all of the releases in their massive library. Indeed, Valve did prove their commitment to long-term relationships when they announced their partnership with GameStop and other retailers who plan to sell their hardware, which goes on sale in November.
