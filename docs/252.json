MORE Sure, a lot of people love \"Game of Thrones .\" But it wasn't that long ago that the whole swords-and-sorcery thing was a one-way ticket to social ostracism. Or maybe it was the only way out. Either way, it sure seems as though the geeks have inherited the earth. At the risk of making an epic overstatement, the redemptive power of geek culture is the heart of a new stage comedy called \"She Kills Monsters,\" which is getting its Arizona premiere from Glendale's Brelby Theatre Company. \"It's kind of about how nerds as a whole have gone on this journey from being underdogs to now being kind of cool,\" says company co-founder Shelby Maticic. Written by New York playwright and fight director <mark>Qui Nguyen</mark>, \"She Kills Monsters\" is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, the role-playing game from the 1970s that has spawned countless imitators, from old-school dice-and-paper play to mega-popular online RPGs such as World of Warcraft. It's a bittersweet comedy about a schoolteacher named Agnes who loses her family but comes to know her kid sister through the fantastical world she created within the game. \"Obviously the show speaks to nerds and has this incredible quest and really intense battle sequences and monsters that we get to play with onstage,\" says Brian Maticic, the show's director (and Shelby's husband). \"But what it comes down to is the theme of escapism, the chance to live that fantasy that you can't have in real life, but also mixed with the personal growth of the main character. It follows her through the grieving process but also her own self-discovery as she learns about who her sister was and who she is as a person .\" Shelby Maticic, who is also the company's artistic director, will play Agnes. \"It's this beautiful journey of her getting to know a sister that she never paid attention to,\" Shelby says. \"She ends up kind of building a new family along the way out of the characters that she meets through the Dungeons & Dragons world, who all actually have real-world counterparts. They were all members of Tilly's gaming circle .\" It's a really sweet, kind of sad show, but it's perfectly balanced with some seriously epic fight sequences as they play out the quest onstage \"- including a climax involving a five-headed dragon puppet. Quite literally a mom-and-pop operation, Brelby doesn't have the resources for a lot of fancy special effects, but the company does what it can to add pizzazz to its productions, as when it did up Oscar Wilde's\" The Importance of Being Earnest \"in steampunk style, complete with giant working cogwheels as part of the stage .\" We have a really intimate studio, but I think we've gotten pretty creative about finding ways to surprise the audience with tech elements, \"Shelby says. Founded in 2009, Brelby Theatre has cultivated a younger audience - college age to young parents - with an eclectic mix that includes the occasional classic drama or Broadway musical but also less-known works by contemporary playwrights, including local writers.

The rest of the line-up is the same as that which beat the Blues last weekend. Eighteen weeks of competition culminate in this southern derby on Saturday night. It is the final round of pool play and will determine log placings and qualifiers for the play-off rounds. While the Crusaders are already guaranteed a play-off spot, they are also working towards a second place qualification that would see them proceed directly to a home semi-final. \"That will require us to beat the Highlanders and beat them well,\" Blackadder said. \"The Highlanders are also a gutsy side though and we know that they will be putting everything they've got into this encounter. We are going to have to put in the performance of the season to come out on top, and that is exactly what the team has committed to doing .\" Kick-off is at 7:35 pm Saturday at AMI Stadium (Addington).

(WHAS11)--A Louisville man is behind bars Tuesday after a deadly dispute with his landlord. Anthony Jecker, 54, is suspected in the shooting death of 49-year-old <mark>James Scott</mark> Tolle inside his Manor Brook Apartment complex in the Norfolk neighborhood. Tolle's father told WHAS 11 News his son had been in a dispute with Jecker over his electric bill, totaling $58. When Jecker didn't pay it, Tolle cut off his electricity. Tensions only escalated from there. \"The neighborhood is just really shocked. Everybody around here is just freaking out,\" neighbor Mary Welch said. \"I'm just having a real hard time grasping that my friend, that I talk to everyday, on a daily basis killed somebody .\" Tolle died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. \"Sixty dollars ain't worth killing somebody for. Take them to court,\" Welch said. Instead, Jecker appeared before a judge Tuesday morning on charges of murder and tampering with evidence, after police said he attempted to dispose of the gun. The judge set his bond at $25,000 cash only, on the conditions he not speak to Tolle's family or carry a firearm. Print print Email Email this article | Tweet MORE MORE!

It comes after a change in her title earlier today. <mark>Lynch</mark> was appointed - Minister of State at the Department of Health with Special Responsibility for Primary Care, Mental Health and Disability. However, in 2011 the Minister of State's title was - Minister of State at the Department of Health with Special Responsibility for Disability, Older People, Equality & Mental Health. Minister <mark>Lynch</mark> has released a statement this evening saying that she \"retains responsibility under the Social Care element of her portfolio for Mental Health, Disability and Older People\". Concerns The charity for older people, Alone, said it is \"extremely concerned' about the change of title. CEO Sean Moynihan said,\" The removal of \"older people' from the Ministerial title strongly suggests a shift in priorities within the current Government. The number of people over the age of 65 is increasing by 20,000 a year. Monihan added,\" in such a climate the government should be prioritising the needs of older people and strategically planning for the future instead of removing them from sight. \"After seeing what my dad has gone through, I'm convinced we need an Ombudsman for the Elderly> Please select the reason for reporting this comment.
