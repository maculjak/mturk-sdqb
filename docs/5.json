Clinton lost the 2016 election to President Donald Trump, but some Republicans in Congress are intensifying their calls to investigate her and other Obama administration officials. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File By Associated Press WASHINGTON--Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election to President Donald Trump, but some Republicans in Congress are intensifying their calls to investigate her and other Obama administration officials. As investigations into Russian meddling and possible links to Trump's campaign have escalated on both sides of the Capitol, some Republicans argue that the investigations should have a greater focus on Democrats. Democrats who have pushed the election probes \"have started a war of investigative attrition,\" said GOP Rep. <mark>Steve King</mark> of Iowa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Several officials from former President Barack Obama's administration and Clinton's campaign have appeared before or been interviewed by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as part of the Russia investigation, along with Trump campaign officials. The GOP-led committees are investigating whether Trump's campaign had any links to Russian interference in last year's election. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif ., has continued a separate investigation into whether Obama administration officials inappropriately made requests to \"unmask\" identities of Trump campaign officials in intelligence reports. The House Judiciary Committee, which has declined to investigate the Russian meddling, approved a resolution this past week to request documents related to the FBI's now-closed investigation of Clinton's emails. In addition, Republican on that committee wrote the Justice Department on Thursday and asked for a second special counsel, in addition to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, to investigate \"unaddressed matters, some connected to the 2016 election and others, including many actions taken by Obama administration.\" \"The American public has a right to know the facts--all of them--surrounding the election and its aftermath,\" the lawmakers wrote. Republicans want to investigate the unmasking issue and also Clinton's email scandal that figured prominently in the campaign. They also frequently bring up former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony that she told him to call the Clinton email investigation a \"matter\" instead of an investigation during the campaign. Nunes wrote his own letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats last week, saying that his committee has learned that one Obama administration official had made \"hundreds\" of the unmasking requests. Even though he remains committee chairman, Nunes stepped back from the Russia investigation earlier this year after he was criticized for being too close to the White House. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, took over the leading role. The committee has conducted bipartisan interviews of witnesses; Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner appeared on Tuesday, a day after talking to Senate staff. But partisan tensions have been evident. GOP Rep. <mark>Pete King</mark> of New York, who's on the House Intelligence Committee, said after the Kushner interview that the committee investigation into Russian meddling is a \"sham.\" \"To me there is nothing to this from the beginning,\" he said of his committee's own probe. \"There is no collusion...it's the phoniest investigation ever.\" Both the Senate and House committees have interviewed or expressed interest in interviewing a series of Democratic witnesses, including Obama's former national security adviser, <mark>Susan Rice</mark>, and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power--both of whom Republicans have said may be linked to the unmasking. <mark>Rice</mark> met with staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, and Power met with the panel Friday. \"Ambassador Power strongly supports any bipartisan effort to address the serious threat to our national security posed by Russia's interference in our electoral process, and is eager to engage with the Senate and House committees on the timeline they have requested,\" Power's lawyer, <mark>David Pressman</mark>, said in a statement.

more user-friendly start tapes to be used, with increased visibility .? an concerted drive to redress the sometimes much faster approaches toward the tape which can occur in bigger races as the jump season progresses .? a specific briefing between the starters' team and jockeys on the day of the grand national .? additional measures put in place to minimize the possibility of a rider-less horse traveling an extended distance before being caught prior to the start. \"our objective in recommending changes to the start is to identify ways in which we can create a calmer and more controlled environment for both horse and rider,\" said jamie stier, director of race day operations and regulation for the bha, in a statement. \"we recognize that there is pressure and tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where possible.\" it is possible that a more controlled environment at the start, along with reducing the distance between the start and the first fence, could have the effect of reducing the early speed of the race. if this were to be the case, it would be an added benefit. \""}, {"articleID": "2008111212_00008848_W", "names": {"Robert Gibbs": ["Q28869465", "Q935136"]}, "date": "2008-11-12", "url": "http://twocircles.net/2008nov12/obama_not_attend_g20_summit.html", "content": "by nnn-pti, washington: us president-elect barack obama will not attend the g20 summit scheduled for this weekend as he believes that there is \"only one president at a time\" , his aides have said. it was widely speculated that obama will join the g20 summit on november 15 in which leaders from various countries, including india, will participate to discuss ways to overcome the financial crisis across the world. although invited to the global financial summit, obama has opted to stay in chicago and will not meet any of the leaders separately, the \"new york times' reported today.\" while some may say it's awkward that he's not there, it would be far more problematic to be there. we firmly believe there is only one president at a time, \"<mark>robert gibbs</mark>, a senior adviser to obama, said. instead, the obama team is scrambling to arrange for surrogates to meet with visiting foreign officials while emphasising that bush remains the nation's leader until january 20.\" it's not appropriate for two people to show up for this meeting, \"john d podesta, co-chairman of obama's transition team was quoted as saying by the new york times. foreign affairs veterans told the paper that obama was trying to play it safe and avoid being forced to take positions on matters he is not authorised to decide, much less take ownership for the problems and decisions of bush.\" i sort of understand why he can't go to that meeting, \"said howard l. berman, democrat of california and chairman of the house foreign affairs committee.\" what if the administration makes a suggestion that he doesnt agree with?

Photo: Michael Cummo / Hearst Connecticut Media Stamford's West Side tries to sober up 1 / 9 Back to Gallery STAMFORD--One West Side man has been taken by ambulance to Stamford Hospital for alcohol poisoning and related injuries about 50 times over the past eight months, police say. This is an acute example of a problem that residents, community leaders and business owners say has afflicted parts of the West Side for at least a year--men drinking on city sidewalks and becoming so intoxicated at times they hurt themselves or endanger others. Part of the issue is the interpretation of a city ordinance regarding alcohol consumption on municipal properties. Police officers until recently had not enforced drinking on city sidewalks. With more vigilant enforcement, the problem has improved, according to those in the area, but it is still far from solved. Near Smith and Alden streets, an area where public drinking is most pronounced, business owners are frustrated. \"People don't come here sometimes because they're over there,\" said Royal Salon owner Myra Quitel, gesturing to sooty concrete steps a few feet from the entrance of her Smith Street beauty shop. \"They have their beer right there.\" Vin Tufo, CEO of Charter Oak Communities, the city's public housing authority and a major stakeholder in the area, said the situation has escalated in recent months. \"Our observation is that people loitering on street corners in front of certain establishments seems to be getting worse,\" he said. \"It was not something we observed even as recently as two years ago. Maybe we weren't focused on it at the time, but we're focused on it now.\" A focus, however, doesn't automatically lead to a solution. Many agree addiction is complicated and addressing it on a community level takes time and resources. \"This basic pattern of congregation in a business area is not a new phenomenon,\" said Alan Mathis, CEO of Liberation Programs, which operates a substance abuse and mental health treatment center on Main Street, less than a mile from Smith and Alden. \"It tends to happen when the economy isn't so good for everybody,\" he said. \"What I witnessed in the late\" 80s and \"90s in parts of New York City is that when people didn't have something to do--whether they were white or black or people who were undocumented--you would see a pattern of folks congregating and drinking alcohol, and that's what they would do to occupy time.\" One of the biggest neighborhood complaints has been the number of ambulances called in response to alcohol-related injuries or people who have passed out in the street--often in the scorching heat or bitter cold. The hospital is usually only blocks away. The West Side is home to Stamford Hospital and its soon-to-be new headquarters, a shimmering, 11-story glass building that cost $450 million and backs up to several streets that are some of the area's most troubled. A spokesman for the hospital said he could not comment on whether there has been a spike in emergency-room visits resulting from public alcohol consumption on the West Side. But the hospital said it often refers people who are frequent ER visitors to a Community Care Team, a group that draws members from the hospital and community to help its neediest patients obtain primary health care and other resources. \"The goal is a better quality of life for them and a better outcome,\" said Dr. <mark>David Reed</mark>, the hospital's medical director for care management. In the streets The West Side is plagued not only by loitering and public intoxication. Gun violence here and in neighboring areas has declined in recent weeks, but has nonetheless resulted in six serious injuries during 14 shootings since March. Some whose city roots span generations argue the West Side has always been a troubled, yet resilient neighborhood. It has historically been a landing spot for immigrants, from Italians in the early 20th century, to African Americans, Latinos and Caribbean immigrants. In the \"80s and\" 90s, the neighborhood yielded to drugs, crime and the failed urban renewal policies that befell other local neighborhoods and cities across the nation. West Side stakeholders have recently argued the police department's policies on loitering and drinking worsened the problem and harmed the neighborhood. Police have a different take. Assistant Police Chief Tom Wuennemann said the department had been trying to determine whether sidewalks qualify as city streets or municipal property in relation to an ordinance that permits beer drinking on city land, including parks, but prohibits any alcohol consumption on city streets. A prosecutor recently told police they are able to issue tickets for imbibing on sidewalks. But a slap on the wrist only does so much. Wuennemann said people spotted sipping from brown paper bags are often directed to nearby parks, where beer drinking is legal. \"We're looking for voluntary cooperation,\" Wuennemann said. He added there's a difference between residents who live in multi-family dwellings and quietly drink outside, and groups who congregate in the streets. \"This is where community policing comes in, knowing the residents and understanding when someone is having a beer in front of their house and it's not a big deal, as opposed to 15 or 20 people sitting on a corner drinking,\" Wuennemann said. When addressing ingrained behaviors, police say they try to work with community groups when possible. \"The problem is deeper than police just issuing a ticket,\" he said. \"We can't provide rehab--all we can do it enforce the law when it fits. I can't give everyone a job. I can't give everyone a house. And I can't solve everyone's substance abuse problem.\" \"Totally solvable' That's when an organization like Liberation House plays a role.\" What it really takes is a small group of outreach workers who are able to come across without a heavy hand to begin to shift their habits and get them engaged in taking care of themselves, \"said Mathis, whose organization was founded in Stamford in the early\" 70s. \"This is totally solvable,\" he said, \"but like anything else in life, it takes effort and resources.\" Resources can be hard to come by, although Rafael Pagan, executive director of Pacific House, formerly Shelter for the Homeless, said Connecticut is leading the nation in providing services for homeless people. The South End emergency shelter is one of the few in the state with a 12-bed substance-abuse recovery unit. However, \"because you're intoxicated on the street doesn't mean that you're homeless necessarily,\" Pagan said. Ingrid Gillespe, executive director of Communities 4 Action, said her group provides Stamford with substance abuse outreach. \"A lot of people don't understand addiction, and when you see somebody on the street, you don't know their story,\" she said, adding that people who begin drinking before age 15 have a 1-in-4 chance of developing a problem with alcohol. Charter Oak's Tufo said what he sees happening on the West Side has escalated beyond social drinking. \"It's almost a lifestyle,\" he said. \"People undergoing significant injury or medical emergencies--these things are frankly very concerning, and they are a use of our precious resources.\" Progress Some business owners say they've seen progress since they began speaking out. \"Police presence is more consistent and the mayor also seems to be taking heed to the needs of the West Side, starting with implementing an ordinance prohibiting drinking on the sidewalks,\" said Toni Lupinacci, an owner of Pellicci's Ristorante, which at one point had ambulances flying past their business on Stillwater several times a day. \"This is an open door for much needed improvements and quality of life issues, thereby giving me incentive to make things happen for our community,\" she said. Joe <mark>Castro</mark> was outside in the sticky heat on Thursday painting the exterior of the barbershop next to Royal Salon a chalky white. \"We still get a lot of complaints over here,\" he said. On the eastern corner of the block is Smith Liquor, which has customers shuffling in and out with paper bags. Several linger a few feet from the corner on Stephen Street. Across the road at Scotty's Fish and Chips, owner Eupert Scotland said he's noticed more police in the area over the past few weeks. \"There used to be a congregation of elements, characters getting drunk and whatnot,\" Scotland said. \"This is my livelihood,\" he said. \"I'm not going to let it affect that.\" eskalka @ scni.com; Twitter: @ lizskalka Most Popular 1 Fairfield, cop sued in teen's death after high speed pursuit 2 Shelton infant's death being investigated as a homicide by...3 Fairfield Property Transfers 4 Drought triggers Aquarion call for water conservation 5 A chat with...Carla Miklos 6 The Latest: Lawyer says cleric suspected in coup plot 7 Bronson Road housing proposal denied again 1 Hillary Clinton, the candidate we know so well--and don't View Comments & copy; 2016 Hearst Communications, Inc. ."}, {"articleID": "2014061104_00071221_W", "names": {"Clive Palmer": ["Q5134643", "Q550879"]}, "date": "2014-06-10", "url": "http://news.ninemsn.com.au/sitecore/content/news/news/national/2014/06/11/07/25/govt-again-pleads-with-senate-over-budget", "content": "Govt again pleads with Senate over budget Treasurer Joe Hockey has again called on non-government MPs in the Senate to support the coalition government's budget, otherwise they will be \"allowing money to walk out the door\" .

The Senate Select Committee's Benghazi Report (The Report) makes clear that the deaths of Amb. <mark>Christopher Stevens</mark>, State Information Officer <mark>Sean Smith</mark>, and Navy Seals Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods could have been prevented on the day of the attack. Above all, their deaths would not have occurred but for Obama and Clinton's dangerous, Islamist-friendly, and unconstitutional military action against Qadhafi. Even worse, it is clear that Hillary put political \"optics\" above the security of American lives on the eve of a Presidential election. In that sense it's a bigger cover-up than Watergate. Yet former conservative and now infamous Clinton sycophant <mark>David Brock</mark>, founder of the George Soros-funded front group Media Matters, would have the public believe that Hillary's deadly failures in Benghazi are non-existent and any criticisms of her, even taken directly out of the bi-partisan, year-long investigation Senate Report, are simply smears. Along with <mark>David Kirkpatrick</mark>'s shameful New York Times story, which was thoroughly debunked a day later by Fox News from witnesses \"who were on the ground\" the night of the Islamist attack, it is clear that the Clintonistas are in cahoots to protect Clinton from facing any scrutiny during her 2016 White House bid. The Report is prima facie evidence that Hillary failed to answer the 3:00 PM call she faced on September 11, 2012 once the attack started on the Mission. Finding #1 of The Report makes clear that Clinton ignored the \"ample strategic warning that [the] security situation in eastern Libya was deteriorating and that U.S. facilities and personnel were at risk in Benghazi.\" On September 5th, six days before the attack, AFRICOM produced a report stating Disarray in Libya and a likely focus by authorities on pursuit of Qadhafi loyalists is likely allowing jihadists in Libya freedom to recruit, train, and facilitate the movement of fighters and weapons. The threat to Western and U.S. interests and individuals remains high, particularly in northeast-Libya. \"[p. 11] Benghazi is the largest city in northeast Libya. The Report also makes clear that Clinton directly denied Amb. <mark>Stevens</mark>'s requests for greater security at the Benghazi Mission. Finding #2 of The Report states that\" (t) he State Department should have increased its security posture more significantly in Benghazi based on the deteriorating security situation...including two incidents at the Temporary Mission Facility on April 6 and June 6, 2012. \"[p. 12] Both of these attacks included IEDs being directed by Islamists at the Mission. The Report explains that Amb. <mark>Stevens</mark> and other State Department officials outlined\" concerns via cables to State Department headquarters about the security of the Mission compound and made several requests for additional resources. \"[p. 14] Yet Clinton's State Department was filled with\" confusion over who, ultimately, was responsible and empowered to make decisions on both policy and security concerns. \"[p. 16] Simply stated, Clinton was too incompetent to run a proper Department whose bureaucracy could prioritize the safety of her subordinates. Not only did Hillary's incompetence bungle the Mission's security, but direct evidence exists which proves that Clinton was intent on denying the Mission proper safety protocols. Internal State Department memos unearthed by Fox News show that Clinton's Under Secretary <mark>Patrick Kennedy</mark> signed off on an action memo\" that green-lighted the Benghazi operation \"with the caveat that the Mission be\" exempted...from mandatory physical security standards \"of a Consulate. It strains credulity to believe that Hillary was not aware of the action memo, especially since Clinton misled the public on a\" diplomatic victory \"in Libya as early as November 2011 when she\" was quick to announce that the U.S. committed $40 million to help Libya secure and recover its weapons stockpiles. \"This would be the same month when The Telegraph reported that the Al Qaeda flag was pictured\" flying above the Benghazi courthouse building...alongside the Libyan national flag. \"Hillary would have the public believe that her Benghazi incompetence could be washed away in her\" bias for action, \"as the carefully crafted introduction of <mark>Jonathan Allen</mark> and Amie Parnes's HRC quotes an unnamed source. Yet the same introduction quotes Hillary telling <mark>Kennedy</mark>,\" the undersecretary who oversaw diplomatic operations, \"that\" she want (s) to see \"to brief\" her team \"on the April 5, 2010 assault on an American compound in Peshawar. That would be twenty months before <mark>Kennedy</mark> signed the deadly Benghazi action memo. The Report also makes clear that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\" found no evidence that significant actions were taken by the State Department between August 15, 2012, and September 11, 2012, to increase security at the Mission (.) \"[p. 16] Yet The Report redacts eleven security upgrades\" quickly \"made by the CIA in its Annex\" due to the threat of continued attacks against Western personnel in Benghazi (.) \"[pp. 19-20] The CIA Annex would repel an attack with loss of US lives the same night our mission was stormed in a precise, military-style attack and four Americans died. Clinton's Benghazi Mission did not even install additional surveillance cameras it had received\" because the State Department has not yet sent out the technical team necessary to install them. \"Further, the camera monitor in the guard force booth\" was inoperable on the day of the attacks due to a needed repair by a technical team. \"The Report makes clear that\" the lack of security enhancements contributed to the security breakdown at the Temporary Mission Facility the night of the attacks. \"[p. 21] While it is no surprise that Hillary or her husband would have any qualms on lying to the American public about the cause of Benghazi attack, or anything else for that matter, it is disconcerting that someone who believes she is capable of serving as Commander in Chief would lie directly to the father of the fallen Navy Seal Tyrone S. Woods on the cause of his son's unnecessary death. Yet in a memorial service days after the Islamist attack, Hillary approached Tyrone's father Charles and assured him that the Obama administration was going to\" arrest and prosecute \"the man that made the scapegoated YouTube video critical of Islam. The Report does not mention the video once. The Report makes clear in FINDING #9 that any report of a\" protest at the Mission facility \"was\" erroneous \"and\" caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers. \"[p. 34] In fact,\" there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks (.) \"[p. 35] The attack was a multi-pronged, sophisticated assault which was coordinated by Ahmad Abu Khattallah, who is a leading member of the Al Qaeda-affiliated group Ansar al-Sharia. A Fox News source who was on the ground describes the Khattallah' s operation as a\" direct action planned attack \"with\" (o) ne guy...shooting, one guy...running. There (were) guys watching the gates...The bosses on the ground were pointing, commanding and coordinating. \"450 days after the attack, Khattallah walks freely around Benghazi. The final RECOMMENDATION of The Report demands that\" the U.S. Government must swiftly bring the attackers to justice, in spite of the unwillingness or lack of capacity of the Libyan government to assist in this effort. \"[p. 43] The government which Obama and Clinton installed is prohibiting the FBI from operating in Libya. Fifteen Libyans who were cooperating with the FBI have been assassinated. And the FBI's $10 million reward was not even publicized the first eleven months after it was issued. Clearly, the Obama administration does not consider the attackers a high priority. One last question remains open from The Report: was the attack on the Benghazi Mission carried out with U.S. weapons? The Intelligence Committee's press release states that\" the U.S. government cannot rely on local security in areas where the United States has facilities under high threat or where the host nation is not capable of providing adequate security. \"We know that Amb. <mark>Stevens</mark> was forced to hire local security militias for protection due to Hillary's denials of his security requests. The Report explains that Amb. <mark>Stevens</mark> believed that the local Libyan militia members would provide the\" least bad option. \"[p. 41] Fire chief says death toll from large landslide in WASHINGTON WASHINGTON STATE mudslide: Officials say 18 people still missing (video) Blocked river trickling through massive mud wall in deadly WASHINGTON LANDSLIDE March Madness 2014: Social media reacts after DAYTON goes all Cinderella on Syracuse Oil spill cleanup efforts continue off TEXAS Gulf shore following collision University of Dayton: Riot Police Respond as Students Fill Streets After Win Over France releases satellite data, could be linked to Malaysia Airlines RUSSIA reset?
