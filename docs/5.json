schroeder the journal gazette advertisement an area diabetes outreach position has been eliminated and some people fear that could leave local parents of children with diabetes in the cold. nicole hansen has been employed by the indiana chapter of the juvenile diabetes research foundation international since 2003, working out of her home in auburn as a special events coordinator. that will end dec. 4, as the state chapter seeks to centralize its efforts in indianapolis. \"this is a model that we use throughout the state...(and) country,\" said linda gann, executive director for the organization's state chapter, said of centralization. gann points out that the chapter has never had a physical office in the area and says volunteers will continue to provide services for area parents and raise money for research. but <mark>heather jones</mark>, the mother of a 13-year-old girl with diabetes, thinks local efforts will suffer in hansen's absence. she lauded hansen's outreach work and said her experience as a parent of a child with diabetes made her a good fit for the job. the foundation provides free backpacks with informational materials about type 1 diabetes, which usually strikes in childhood through early adulthood; helps parents get connected with other parents in the same situation; and holds fundraising events. \"you're not going to have that personal connection\" with someone in indianapolis, said <mark>jones</mark>, who lives between auburn and butler. another parent also said hansen will be missed, a sentiment <mark>jones</mark> said many parents share. <mark>jones</mark> is worried connections between local families helped along by hansen will be fractured without a paid staffer positioned in northeast indiana. <mark>jones</mark> says it's particularly hard to endure a child's diabetes diagnosis without the support of other families that have been through it - there's a lot to learn and it can be an emotional rollercoaster. she also thinks local fundraising efforts will suffer. hansen said the foundation has raised more than $1 million - most going to research - through six local fundraising walks during her tenure. for her part, hansen said she believes in the organization and its mission, but questions the decision to eliminate her position. she says it is going to be a challenge for people to get connected if they have to go through the indianapolis office. gann says the foundation isn't alone in its effort to centralize efforts, pointing to the american diabetes association. she doesn't anticipate the drop-off in services others fear, reiterating the organization's reliance on volunteers.", "articleID": "2008112611_00015150_W", "names": {"Heather Jones": ["Q14159639", "Q5693910"]}}, {"date": "2008-11-27",

the days of saturday autumn glory seem boundless about the time you\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re stacking mountain dew in the dorm fridge, but it always ends like this: a guy shaking his head, wondering where the time went. joe ganz feels it this week. he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s a senior. it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s his turn to feel it. \"you\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re in the middle of the season and you\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re like, \u00e2 \u20ac \u02dcgod, is this thing ever going to end? \u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 and now you\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re here and it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s like,\" wow, it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s really over, \u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 \"the husker senior quarterback said tuesday .\" so it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s going to be a special time. hopefully i can control my emotions. i have to go out there and still play a game. it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s going to be tough. it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s going to be pretty emotionally high on our end. \"what\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s one more emotional roller coaster for these husker seniors? they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve already been on a ride more wild than anything found at the nearest amusement park. for those who committed to this program during the 2003 season, they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve endured the firing of two head coaches, two bowlless winters and more angst surrounding the husker football program than probably has ever been .\" just like anything else in life, there\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s been a lot of ups and downs, probably more extreme as far as this football program\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s been used to, \"husker senior wide receiver <mark>todd peterson</mark> said .\" but it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s just something you kind of ride out. they always say sports can teach you a lot about life and you can kind of see that through everything we\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve been through since i\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve been here. it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s been a wild ride. \"and yet for whatever dips this ride has featured, seniors will take on their last game at memorial stadium on friday against colorado with the chance to place a big happy face above whatever turmoil came before .\" a couple years from now i think we\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ll all feel pretty good about ourselves, maybe, \"husker senior defensive tackle ty steinkuhler said .\" get a few more wins here, 9-4, and we\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve left this place on a high note. it will be a good feeling. \"foundation is the word first-year head coach bo pelini has used this season when talking about his seniors. their job is to build the foundation that greater things might be built upon in future years. not everything\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s gone the way it was hoped for this year, <mark>peterson</mark> said,\" but i think we\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re setting it up for some of the younger guys to show them the path it takes to get there. \"it will be the final home game for 21 seniors, and 12 of those are players in their fifth year. some committed even while pelini was the defensive coordinator here in 2003. some have been on board long enough to have seen the firing of frank solich, the hope that came with the hiring of <mark>bill callahan</mark>, the firing of <mark>bill callahan</mark>, and now the hope that has come with the hiring of pelini .\" they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve been through a lot, \"pelini said .\" going into their senior year they had to deal with another coaching change and that is never easy, especially going into your senior year. i thought they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve responded well. they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve led this football team. i have a lot of respect or these guys. they come to work every day, they practice hard, they have great attitudes, there is a lot of character and we\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 re going to miss those guys. \"during the past four seasons, nebraska football has gone 29-20 and all kind of mood changes have revolved around that record. this senior class was there in 2005 when the huskers stormed into colorado and won 30-3 and the words\" restore the order \"came into the lexicon of nebraskans. an alamo victory followed and so did a big 12 north title in 2006. but then came a loss to oklahoma and a cotton bowl loss to auburn. and then came 5-7. kansas scored 76. colorado scored 65. a new coach came aboard. bo shirts hit the shopping malls. a better vibe hit nebraska .\" he just came in with a positive attitude, \"<mark>peterson</mark> said .\" he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s got a lot of grief this year for yelling on the sidelines and being so intense, but he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s a positive guy for the most part. he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s come here from day one and he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s pushed us, he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s made us work, but he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s always had our back and he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s always been a guy you could go talk to. \"the seniors fed off that, but they also fed off each other .\" we really came together in spring ball and summer, and just really told our guys that we weren\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 t going to go out like that, \"said senior defensive end zach potter. so how will they go out? they\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 ve won four of their last five, but they know total satisfaction won\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 t be reached without a win friday against colorado. follow that with a bowl win and it would be just nu\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s second nine-win season in the last five years. there\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 d be plenty of pride in that. a wild ride, sure. but ganz, a guy who patiently sat off to the side until given his chance to start at the end of last year, said he\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 d do it all over again in a heartbeat .\" it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s made me the man i am today, \"he said .\" it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s done a lot more than shape me as a football player. it\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 s shaped me as a man and a person, somebody who just understands life a lot better. i wouldn\u00e2 \u20ac \u2122 t trade this experience for anything in the world. \"", "articleID": "2008112709_00033561_W", "names": {"Bill Callahan": ["Q3639958", "Q4908389", "Q862005"], "Todd Peterson": ["Q42581285",

delhi: with the mumbai terror strikes killing 183 people - at least 20 of them foreigners - and sparking global outrage, india has decided to intensify cooperation with security agencies of other countries, a move that is likely to put extra pressure on pakistan to come clean on its alleged links with the attacks. \"india does not have issues with seeking cooperation of intelligence agencies of other countries, specially in an incident like this in which foreign nationals are involved,\" official sources told ians. a federal bureau of investigation (fbi) team landed in mumbai sunday night. it has already surveyed the <mark>taj mahal</mark> palace and tower hotel which, along with the trident-oberoi hotel and nariman house, was the scene of the almost 61-hour long operation to flush out the terrorists who had seized the three buildings. the fbi team is reported to have traced an e-mail sent to lahore by the deccan mujahideen, a shadowy organization which has claimed responsibility for wednesday night's terror attacks that injured at least 325. besides the fbi, security teams from israel and britain are also in india to help investigation agencies here in unearthing the larger plot behind the mumbai carnage. the only terrorist captured by indian authorities following the mumbai attacks told his interrogators that he and the 10 other men in his group were sent specifically to kill israelis to avenge \"atrocities\" against the palestinians. six israelis, some dual citizens but all of them jews, were killed in the attack on the nariman house, also known as chabad house, one of the 10 targets hit by terrorists in a series of coordinated attacks across the city. amir kasab, 21, told investigators that this was why they targeted the chabad house, an outreach center meant for local jews and jews touring india, including israelis. india's polite declining of an israeli offer to send its elite counter-terror squad to end the siege of nariman house has been criticized by some sections of the israeli media. however, new delhi feels that it did the right thing by refusing the israeli assistance as this may have delayed the anti-terrorist operation. \"it would have required some time to brief israeli squads about the geography of the place and other issues relating to rules of engagement. besides, our people are as good as anybody else,\" official sources said. \"we can't have foreign troops carrying out anti-terror operations in our country. this is unacceptable,\" g. parthasarathy, a former indian envoy to pakistan, told ians. \"however, we must fully cooperate with intelligence agencies of other countries,\" he added. enlisting the assistance of foreign intelligence agencies will also help put extra pressure on pakistan to clear the air about those elements india suspects to behind the mumbai attacks, parthasarathy said. <mark>satish chandra</mark>, a former deputy national security adviser and also a former envoy to pakistan, agreed. \"this is call to be taken by security agencies only. we have good expertise in this area. we don't really need anybody's help,\" <mark>chandra</mark> told ians. the fbi team was briefly detained at the chattrapati shivaji international airport sunday night after customs officials refused to allow forensics equipment on board their aircraft on indian soil, sources in intelligence bureau said. however, senior raw officials said the team arrived here without providing prior lists of personnel and the specialised forensic equipment they were carrying. since customs officials in mumbai had no idea what the fbi team was carrying, they were asked about this. \"we do not want foreign investigating agencies to aid us in a probe which we are capable of handling. if we allow one agency to join the investigation it will lead to a precedent which we have been avoiding all these years,\" said a senior raw functionary. india had granted permission to the fbi to examine the sites involved in the mumbai terror attack since us nationals were also targeted. six americans were among the foreigners killed in the terror strikes. us president <mark>george bush</mark> has pledged his full support for the investigation into the attacks and will be sending secretary of state condoleezza rice to india wednesday for mutual consultations over the strikes. <mark>bush</mark> has assured prime minister <mark>manmohan singh</mark> that the us will provide all necessary resources and will work with the international community to bring those responsible for the bloodshed to
