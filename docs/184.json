This quarter, investors poured $625.5 million into iShares Silver Trust,, the most since 2010, data show. iShares owns more than half of total silver holdings in ETFs. Silver has rallied 39 percent this year, helped by a tailwind from gains in gold, as the Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates steady and other central banks increased stimulus to support growth. An improving outlook for the U.S. economy and Chinese manufacturing has also benefited silver, with industrial use accounting for more than half of the metal's demand. \"Some of the data that we've seen from an industrial standpoint has been relatively decent,\" <mark>Tim Evans</mark>, the chief market strategist at Long Leaf Trading Group Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. \"Silver having that industrial component, tends to respond more favorably to those kinds of news development than gold does .\" Consumer confidence rose in September to the highest since before the last recession on optimism about the labor market, according to a report from the New York-based Conference Board on Tuesday.

The mobile network suffered disruption from 5am on Thursday, with full service not returning until early today. Guidance from regulator Ofcom said that, depending on circumstances, it \"may be appropriate\" for mobile networks to offer some form of compensation for loss of service. O2 said it would update customers later on Friday on how \"we will make yesterday's data service issue up to them\". Customers wishing to complain should follow a company's formal complaints procedure - usually completing an online form or phoning the company directly. If customers are not happy with how a complaint has been responded to, or it takes more than eight weeks to be resolved, a further complaint can be submitted to an independent Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme. In the case of O2, this is Ofcom-approved Ombudsman Services: Communications, which reviews a case and comes to an independent decision on it, usually within six weeks. Sky Mobile, one of the operators affected by the outage as it uses O2 network, has already confirmed it will compensate customers with a day of free unlimited data. The network said: \"We're really sorry for the issues you experienced on Sky Mobile yesterday .\" We're giving you a day of free unlimited UK data this Saturday 8 Dec, so you can catch up on all the things you've missed. You don't need to do a thing. \"Meanwhile, O2 promised to carry out a review to understand what went wrong. British customers reported not being able to use mobile data to access the internet and the operator's network on Thursday after disruption began at about 5am. On Thursday evening, O2 said 3G data service had started returning and was expected to be fully restored by 9.30 pm, while the company reported at 3.30 am on Friday that the 4G network had been restored .\" Our technical teams will continue to monitor service performance closely over the next few days to ensure we remain stable, \"a spokesman said .\" A review will be carried out with Ericsson to understand fully what happened. \"We'd like to thank our customers for their patience during the loss of service on Thursday 6 December and we're sorry for any impact the issue may have caused .\" The company had earlier issued a joint apology with telecoms company Ericsson. O2 UK chief executive <mark>Mark Evans</mark> said: \"I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them .\" We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry. \"O2, which has more than 25 million UK customers, saw disruption to its network last for most of the day on Thursday. Other mobile networks, including Sky, Tesco and Giffgaff, were also affected by the problem because their networks use O2 services. Marielle Lindgren, chief executive of Ericsson UK and Ireland, said:\" The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned. \"She added:\" Ericsson sincerely apologises to customers for the inconvenience caused. \"0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2015020319_00065237_W", "names": {"Bob Smith": ["Q1173492", "Q19577917", "Q20710739", "Q20710756", "Q28803422", "Q2907827", "Q4934018", "Q4934021", "Q4934022", "Q4934024", "Q4934025", "Q4934026", "Q51644740", "Q888261"]}, "date": "2015-01-26", "url": "http://embedded-computing.com/news/updated-brochure-product-catalog-available-dataforth/", "content": "Dataforth has just published two revised and updated MAQ20 Industrial Data Acquisition & Control documents: a 4-page brochure and the 32-page 2015 Product Catalog.

three key figures from argentina's \"dirty war\" got hefty jail terms for the systematic theft of babies from political prisoners during the 1976-1983 dictatorship, an argentine court ruled on thursday. the missing children - stolen from their parents and illegally adopted, often by military families - are one of the most painful legacies of the crackdown on leftist dissent in which rights groups say up to 30,000 people were killed. just over 100 of the children have discovered their true identities, but many families are still searching more than three decades later. activists say there could be several hundred more individuals who do not know they were taken as babies from their parents. \"this is what we were seeking. we never wanted revenge, we were never hateful, we didn't ask for anything more than justice and justice has been done,\" an elderly man who identified himself as francisco madariaga's grandfather told local television. the sentences in the case known as \"the systematic plan\" investigated the theft and illegal adoption of 34 of the stolen infants. the 11 defendants included former junta leaders jorge rafael videla, 86, and reynaldo bignone, 84, and ex-navy officer jorge acosta - known as the tiger. they are already serving life sentences for previous human rights convictions. videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison as the architect of the plan, while acosta got 30 years and bignone 15. the other defendants were also ordered to serve sentences of various lengths. videla, who is unrepentant about rights abuses committed by the state, described himself as a \"political prisoner\" during the trial and said any abductions that did take place were not part of a systematic plan. \"the women giving birth, who i respect as mothers, were militants who were active in the machine of terror,\" the former dictator said in his closing remarks. \"many used their unborn children as human shields .\" some of the stolen babies were born to women held at clandestine torture centres. nurses have told how some babies were breast-fed by their mothers for several days, while others were taken away immediately. there were no birth certificates, making the task of identifying them and reuniting them with their parents' relatives painstaking and lengthy. most of the 34 children in the case have been identified. they include pro-government city legislator juan cabandie, now 34, who was born at the infamous esma naval mechanics school when his 16-year-old mother alicia was held there. he was adopted by a policeman and given a new name. another is leftist lawmaker victoria donda, whose parents were also kidnapped and held at the esma before disappearing without trace. others, like clara anahi mariani, are still missing. as a three-month-old infant, she was kidnapped when state security services raided her home in 1976, killing her mother and fellow leftist activists in the central city of la plata. her grandmother, maria isabel chorobik de mariani, has been searching for clara anahi ever since. \"a lot of girls come here to see if they are clara anahi,\" said chorobik, who was knitting a sweater for her granddaughter when the raid took place at her son's house on a november night 36 years ago. \"at first, it was awful to find out that a girl who had the same birthday, the same name and a bunch of other things that made us think it was her didn't match up in the (dna) test,\" she told reuters television. \"my soul's become hardened .\" chorobik founded human rights group the grandmothers of the plaza de mayo to search for the stolen babies of the \"disappeared\" children. so far 102 have been identified, but campaigners say there could be several hundred more who are yet to discover their true identities. when the dictatorship fell in 1983, courts convicted former members of the military junta of human rights crimes. they were later released under an amnesty. in 2005, argentina's supreme court struck down the amnesty at the urging of then-president nestor kirchner, late husband of current president <mark>cristina fernandez</mark>. the kirchners met as student activists in the 1970s, and several of their friends were kidnapped and killed for political activities. since then, courts have convicted and sentenced a series of former military and police officers on human rights charges. the convictions have brought some comfort to rights activists including chorobik. but she says the nightmare of the stolen babies will haunt the victims and their families for years to come. \"sometimes when newspapers report that a missing child has been found and they've met their family, people think it's a fairy tale,\" she said. \"but behind all this, there's a heavy burden on these kids. i'm sure clara anahi has buried in her memory the noise of that attack, the yelling and the gunshots and being separated from her mother .\" we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see our flagship financial information platform incorporating reuters insider an ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution a connected approach to governance, risk and compliance thomson reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing, and interactive television platforms. thomson reuters journalists are subject to an"}, {"articleID": "2019032108_00364697_W", "names": {"Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]}, "date": "2019-03-21", "url": "http://wboc.com/story/40170539/report-myanmar-china-failing-to-stop-bride-trafficking", "content": "Report: Myanmar, China failing to stop \"bride' trafficking -

More Scientists are warning that historic flooding could soon deluge parts of several southern states along the lower Mississippi River, where flood waters could persist for several weeks. More By ELAINE KURTENBACHAssociated Press BANGKOK (AP) - Authorities in China and Myanmar are failing to stop the brutal trafficking of young women, often teenagers, from the conflict-ridden Kachin region for sexual slavery, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. The report released Thursday says women are often tricked into traveling to China in search of work or kidnapped and held against their will to be sold as\" brides \"for Chinese men. Most of those taken hostage by Chinese families are locked up and raped, it says. Those who do escape are often obliged to leave children fathered by Chinese men behind. The report urges authorities to do more to raise awareness about the risks of trafficking, provide more support for victims who return home, and to prosecute those guilty of crimes against them. The 226 known cases of such trafficking in 2017 were only a fraction of the total number, since many victims are afraid or ashamed to come forward, especially given the lack of support from law enforcement or welfare services, the report says .\" Human Rights Watch's research suggests the number of women and girls being trafficked is substantial and possibly growing, \"it said. The group interviewed 37 survivors of such crimes for the report. It said the women were sold to Chinese families for the equivalent of $3,000 - $13,000 each. Twelve of those interviewed were under 18 when they were trafficked. The youngest was 14. It said 22 of them were held for a year or longer. Often, the women are drugged and taken captive, left at the mercy of families with whom they can barely communicate .\" Most were locked in a room and raped repeatedly as the families that bought them wanted them to become pregnant, \"said Heather Barr, author of the report and a co-director for women's rights at Human Rights Watch. The traffickers are able to lure women with false promises of jobs because of the lack of good options for making a living in camps for displaced people in northern Myanmar's Kachin state. As of September, there were about 100,000 people displaced inside Kachin, where the Kachin Independence Army, like other ethnic minority armed groups, has been fighting for greater autonomy for decades. Thousands of women and children have also fled their homes in neighboring Shan state, some across the border into China. The porous border between southern China's Yunnan province and northern Kachin facilitates such trafficking, and the relative shortage of marriageable women, thanks to Chinese traditions favoring male heirs over girls has left many families in China desperate for brides. Although Chinese authorities have been battling trafficking inside China as well, the families who buy the women are almost never prosecuted, the report says. Some foreign brides from neighboring countries go voluntarily. But for many, the experience is harrowing. One interviewee, Ja Htoi Tsawm, was kidnapped while doing farm work in China to support her family and held captive for two years. While she was away her in-laws sold her house and put one of her children in an orphanage. Another of her four children died. The report said that Myanmar police and other authorities refused interviews by Human Rights Watch although the Ministry of Social Welfare did provide some data. Myanmar anti-trafficking police said they handled 130 cases of trafficking, 96 of which involved women, in January-July 2018, the report said. Of 820 successful prosecutions for trafficking in 2008-2013, 534 cases involved forced marriages and an even larger share were with China. The trafficking networks span China Chinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment, it said. The persisting conflict in areas of Myanmar has left millions of women and children vulnerable to great risk. U.N. investigators reported last fall on a fact-finding mission that found violence by the Myanmar military in Kachin, Shan and the western state of Rakhine. It cited allegations of crimes by the military and other security forces including murder, torture, pillaging, execution without due process, rape, sexual slavery and hostage taking. Members of the Kachin Women's Association, a group affiliated with the Kachin Independence Organization that helps victims, were quoted as saying that at times they lack the money to help provide and top up SIM cards needed to keep in contact with the women still stuck in China.

does our theological rhetoric have any impact in our daily walk with our saviour? i purposely used the pronoun \"our\" because i have to honestly confess that i am guilty of this as well. \"theology matters!\" , as <mark>james white</mark> so eloquently puts it. every christian is a theologian in some sense. we are always learning more about the lover of our soul everyday as we fellowship with him. our theology will inevitably determine how we view god, ourselves, worship, his word, the world around us, etc. so if you don't have a sound, biblical theology and doctrine, then you will miss out on the joy of knowing jesus christ more intimately. moreover, you may end up loving someone else other than the triune god of the scriptures. i am okay with calling myself a 5 point calvinist, reformed baptist, dichotomist, etc. but these titles are meaningless if they bear no weight upon my soul. many have asked me, \"does it really matter if you are a calvinist or not?\" i would say it most certainly does! albert n. martin wrote a compelling booklet called, \"the practical implications of calvinism\" , which you can find and purchase on my recommended books page. he addresses how the doctrines of grace should have a direct affect on a christian's every day life. here is an excerpt, \"what is the personal practical effect of the confession of calvinism in the life of a man? if he sees god, it will break him, and if he understands that god saves sinners, it will make him a trustful, prayerful, watchful person pursuing practical godliness. is that what these doctrines are for you right where you sit this morning?\" (pg .23) pastor loves tattoos, but?

(Photo: Donna Burton/CBP/cc) In a letter Thursday to Acting Homeland Security Secretary <mark>Kevin McAleenan</mark>, 33 House Democrats demanded that U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost resign over her participation in a secret Facebook group in which members of the federal agency shared racist, sexist, and violent comments about migrants and members of Congress. Early last month, ProPublica reported on a Facebook group called \"I'm 10-15,\" which references the Border Patrol code for \"aliens in custody .\" Created in August of 2016, the group had nearly 10,000 members who were currently or formerly employed by the Department of Homeland Security. Just days after the initial report, The Intercept's Ryan Devereaux revealed that Provost was a member of the group. The nearly three dozen lawmakers, including Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Susan Wild (Penn.), charged in their letter (pdf) to <mark>McAleenan</mark> that Provost \"has lost the public's confidence that she can faithfully execute the responsibilities of her position without bias or prejudice .\" They wrote in part: Ms. Provost was a willing participant in a secret Facebook group used by employees of her agency to share [contemptible] and atrocious commentary that stokes racist and xenophobic tropes that have no place in private, much less in public service. The Facebook group, originally known as \"I'm 10-15,\" generated content that joked about migrant deaths and throwing burritos at Members of Congress, and even went so far as to make sexually violent and threatening statements about female members of Congress who came to the border to inspect the conditions at detention centers. We worry this content impugns the character of the U.S. Border Patrol as a whole. While Provost initially publicly expressed surprise about the group, promised that employees who participated would be held accountable, and said the DHS Inspector General's Office would be investigating the matter, the letter pointed out that \"conspicuously absent from her statement was an admission that she had been a member of the Facebook group for months .\" \"It is Ms. Provost's responsibility to discipline employees who fall under her agency's auspices, not participate in conduct unbecoming of her office,\" the lawmakers declared, calling on <mark>McAleenan</mark> \"to follow Ms. Provost's own promise of accountability, by immediately seeking her resignation .\" In a tweet announcing the letter, Pressley called Provost's participation in the group \"deeply disturbing and absolutely unacceptable .\" She wrote that if <mark>McAleenan</mark> \"has one ounce of dignity left, he'll demand her resignation immediately .\" The @ CBP Chief's participation in a group filled with racist & misogynistic attacks on Members of Congress & migrant families in her care is deeply disturbing & absolutely unacceptable. If @ DHSMcAleenan has one ounce of dignity left, he'll demand her resignation immediately. pic.twitter.com/PHrYythp4p--Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@ RepPressley) August 1, 2019 The lawmakers, in the letter, also highlighted the humanitarian crisis at the U.S. Southern border--from the forcible separation of children from their parents to the inhumane conditions in which migrants have been detained. According to the letter Thursday, \"the callousness displayed in the Facebook group is matched only by the callous treatment of children detainees under Ms. Provost's watch .\" SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Get our best delivered to your inbox. \"The conditions at these detention centers--which include limited access to basic hygienic needs like showers, toothpaste, and clean clothes--are not just failures of sufficient funding, they are failures of leadership,\" the letter continued. \"These Facebook posts suggest that the culprit is not just lack of resources but a level of malice that has no place in the policing of our borders .\" In addition to Pressley and Wild, the letter was also signed by Democratic Reps. <mark>Karen Bass</mark> (Calif.), <mark>Steve Cohen</mark> (Tenn.), Madeleine Dean (Penn.), Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), Nanette Diaz Barragan (Calif.), Madeleine Dean (Penn.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), <mark>Dwight Evans</mark> (Penn.), <mark>Ruben Gallego</mark> (Ariz.), Sylvia Garcia (Texas), Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), Deb Haaland (N.M.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Barbara Lee (Calif.), Andy Levin (Mich.), Alan Lowenthal (Calif.), Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.), Tom Malinowski (N.J.), <mark>Jim McGovern</mark> (Mass.), Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), Frank Pallone (N.J.), <mark>Donald Payne</mark> Jr. (N.J.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), <mark>Bobby Rush</mark> (Ill.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), Darren Soto (Fla.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), <mark>Juan Vargas</mark> (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Texas), Nydia Velazquez (N.Y.), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J.). Read the full letter below: Dear Acting Secretary <mark>McAleenan</mark>: We, the undersigned Members of Congress, request that you immediately request the resignation of Carla Provost, Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, who has lost the public's confidence that she can faithfully execute the responsibilities of her position without bias or prejudice. Ms. Provost was a willing participant in a secret Facebook group used by employees of her agency to share contemptable and atrocious commentary that stokes racist and xenophobic tropes that have no place in private, much less in public service. The Facebook group, originally known as \"I'm 10-15,\" generated content that joked about migrant deaths and throwing burritos at Members of Congress, and even went so far as to make sexually violent and threatening statements about female members of Congress who came to the border to inspect the conditions at detention centers. We worry this content impugns the character of the U.S. Border Patrol as a whole. Earlier this month, Ms. Provost expressed surprise about the Facebook group at issue and publicly stated, \"[t] hese posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see--and expect--from our agents day in and day out .\" She also promised that \"[a] ny employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable .\" At that same time, she stated that she had alerted the DHS Inspector General's Office and an investigation would be launched. Conspicuously absent from her statement was an admission that she had been a member of the Facebook group for months--as evidenced by her comments on a particular post questioning her ascent to Chief--or an explanation as to why she hadn't already alerted DHS of the Facebook group. As Chief of U.S. Border Patrol it is Ms. Provost's responsibility to discipline employees who fall under her agency's auspices, not participate in conduct unbecoming of her office. It appears that to date CBP employees have only received cease and desist letters or been placed on administrative duties pending investigation--and only after the Facebook group came to light through news reports. For the avoidance of any doubt, the callousness displayed in the Facebook group is matched only by the callous treatment of children detainees under Ms. Provost's watch. The conditions at these detention centers--which include limited access to basic hygienic needs like showers, toothpaste, and clean clothes--are not just failures of sufficient funding, they are failures of leadership. These Facebook posts suggest that the culprit is not just lack of resources but a level of malice that has no place in the policing of our borders. As Members of Congress, we are committed to ensuring that those who occupy top positions in federal government are held to the highest standards. This is especially true of the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol, at a time when conditions at our southern border have reached a crisis point. As such, we urge you to follow Ms. Provost's own promise of accountability, by immediately seeking her resignation. Our work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.
