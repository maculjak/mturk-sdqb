Mason Greenwood saved his team-mates' blushes on Thursday night as the teenager secured an unconvincing 1-0 win against Astana in the Red Devils' Europa League opener. Things could have been so different had United capitalised on their bright start, with Rashford guilty of missing a number of opportunities against the champions of Kazakhstan. Important win to get us up and running. Refocus now for the weekend?? \u26aa \ufe0f pic.twitter.com/t2bDVeRbFf--Marcus Rashford (@ MarcusRashford) September 19, 2019 Solskjaer has spoken of his desire for the 21-year-old to score more scrappy goals but is not worried by the fact that the academy graduate has netted just once from open play in eight appearances for club and country this season. \"He's getting the chances,\" the United boss said of Rashford, who scored two spot-kicks this term. \"Of course he could have had three today. The keeper made a few fantastic saves .\" I don't worry about that, no. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not concerned about Rashford's form (Martin Rickett/PA) \"We're working every single day in training with Marcus. He wants to improve, wants to be better .\" He could've finished with his left instead of his right today. It's just one of those days. I thought their keeper was excellent. \"Asked if United need more goals from Rashford and fellow forward Anthony Martial, he said:\" All the goals we've scored have come from the forwards with Marcus and Anthony, and Dan James. I'm sure they'll chip in with many, many goals. \"He is still young, he'll improve. You won't hit your peak as a striker until you're 26 or 27. 3 points is what matters.

Paul Pogba's brace helped Solskjaer's side win the reverse fixture 2-1 in April and the Norwegian has underlined the importance of keeping the Hammers out this time around. United's porous defence has been their undoing during their rocky patch under the Norwegian, but he is not concerned by the winless away run that stretches back to the jaw-dropping victory at Paris St Germain in March .\" Why should we as coaches be concerned?

Bird Population in U.S. & Canada Dropped by Nearly 3 Billion Since 1970 Sep 20, 2019 A shocking new study has found the United States and Canada have lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970, a 29% population drop. Researchers blamed numerous factors, including widespread habitat loss and the use of agricultural chemicals. Peter Marra of Georgetown University co-authored the report. Peter Marra:\" Birds are the quintessential ecosystem indicators. They are the canaries in the coal mine. When something's going wrong with birds, something's going wrong with the environment. It's just not healthy. And so, in this study, because we've seen so many declines across so many different types of birds, from warblers to thrushes to even house sparrows--these non-native species in urban areas are declining--that's not a good sign. That's an indication that something is really wrong with the environment. \"Benny Gantz Declares Victory, Rejects Overture from Netanyahu Sep 20, 2019 In news from the Middle East, Israel's former army chief Benny Gantz has declared victory over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after Monday's election.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau:\" The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot. \"Canadian New Democratic leader Jagmeet Singh responded to the growing scandal.

The player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, jumped out of a hotel room wearing only his underwear after being filmed with a woman who was not his partner. He had previously met Natalie Wood, 28, on two occasions after contacting her on social media and arranged to meet her for a third time last year. Wood, along with three men, allegedly hatched a plot to blackmail the sportsman by filming \"incriminating\" footage of him in bed with her. Bristol Crown Court has heard the plan was formed after Wood revealed her liaisons with the footballer to former Take Me Out contestant Tyrone Coleman, 34. <mark>Simon Jones</mark>, prosecuting, told jurors that messages between the defendants, and Wood and the player, had been examined by police as part of the investigation. In one voice message sent before the incident, Rowe told Tyrone Coleman: \"...been plotting this for too long to be taken out of the equation\". Coleman replied: \"[The footballer's] days are numbered. It is what it is fam. The dirty **** .\" Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to \"keep him enticed and draw him in\". Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should \"play it smooth--make him want this now\". She sent the player a number of \"provocative\" messages ahead of their meeting, <mark>Simon Jones</mark>, prosecuting, said. \"The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is--it is all a sting,\" Mr <mark>Jones</mark> told the jury.

As well as it benefits all of us I know .\" READ MORE Lenny Henry tells audience: I am Justin Trudeau Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player--discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room--to Rowe. The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged \"general chit chat\" on social media before meeting at a hotel. He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived--sending him the room number in a message. On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed \"nervous\" and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were \"only going there for one thing\". \"All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room,\" he told jurors. \"One of the guys said something like:\" Is this what you are doing?'. It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged. \"I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was .\" The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived. His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it. Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai. The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, 37, who was charged with handling stolen goods. After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Wood's phone, stating that he had been in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\" and telling him to contact a number. \"I don't really want to expose you to the media but if you don't respond within 24 hours then you leave me no choice,\" it said. When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: \"Obviously it is blackmail .\" That's what they wanted to do--to get footage of me and take it to the papers. \"Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner .\" I had previously asked him if he did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I asking if he was single, \"she said .\" I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, it's not right. \"She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money .\" He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, \"Wood told the court .\" The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room. \"READ MORE Emiliano Sala's sister calls pair\" wicked' for accessing mortuary footage She said it did not go to plan as the footballer \"jumped out of the window\" before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.

On the eve of the party's annual conference in Brighton, the Labour leader said they would look to force an election once it was clear a no-deal Brexit was off the table. However in a round of ITV regional news interviews, he said if there was a hung parliament and they were unable to achieve an overall majority, Labour would seek to govern as a minority government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would not be part of a coalition (Gareth Fuller/PA) \"We would go into government with whatever election result was. I am not doing deals. I am not doing coalitions,\" he told UTV. Mr Corbyn rejected the idea that Labour could offer the SNP a second referendum on Scottish independence in order to win its support at Westminster. At the same time however, he refused to rule out a further public vote later in the parliament if there was a demand for one in Scotland. \"It is not our priority. It is not what I want, it is not what I support,\" he told Border TV. \"But if after some years in government there is a demand, then in terms of the devolution settlement we will look at it at that time .\" Speaking on STV, he added: \"Obviously in the longer run, if a request is made...I am not going to be the one who stands in the way of that .\" His comments came after shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> sparked a furious row over the summer when he suggested a Labour government would not stand in the way of a referendum if there was support for one in the Scottish Parliament. The leader of Scottish Labour, <mark>Richard Leonard</mark>, said at the time the 2014 referendum had been a \"once-in-a-generation vote\" and that the Scottish people did not want to go through a second independence poll. Mr Corbyn said that he would press for a general election once it was clear that Boris Johnson could not force through a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of Parliament. \"When the Prime Minister abides by the law which Parliament has passed which requires him if he cannot get a deal to apply for an extension, I think that is the time,\" he told ITV Anglia. \"What we won't do is to fall into some trap created by Boris Johnson which would lead us into a no-deal Brexit with all the chaos that would bring .\" Mr Corbyn defended his position of seeking to negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and then putting it to the public in a referendum along with the option to remain in the EU, without coming down on either side. He rejected criticism that his policy was a \"muddle\" and that he was failing to offer leadership on an issue of crucial national importance. \"I am not sitting on the fence,\" he told YTV. \"I think leadership comes from listening. I think leadership comes from asking people to look at the realities of the situation .\" It is not a muddled position. It is a position that takes the issue seriously. \"Speaking on Tyne Tees, he added:\" We need a democratic mandate from the people.

According to a Seminole County Sheriff's Office incident report, 14 year old Curtis Leonard was called to the discipline office on Thursday for an unrelated incident. When he he opened his backpack, that's when an administrator noticed a gun and notified a deputy. Deputies say the chamber was loaded, but the gun was disassembled. Leonard now faces a felony charge of possession of a firearm of school property and was taken to the Juvenile Assessment Center. This is the second incident within the last year where a student managed to sneak a gun onto the campus. Following this incident, school leaders say another situation happened on Friday where students came forward and accused a 15 year old student of carrying a weapon on school grounds. They say 15 year old Bernard Blackmon was located with a 7 inch fishing knife and was arrested. The arrest report shows Blackmon has also been charged with possession of a weapon on school property. In response of these incidents, school leaders say that they are testing new technology as part of a pilot program which acts similar to metal detectors, but can be used in more places. They also want to remind students to report any suspicious activities by calling the SpeakOut hotline at 800-423-8477 or use their campus app .\" Take care of it': NC sheriff accused of plotting murder of deputy over tape of racist talk A North Carolina sheriff stands accused of urging the murder of a former deputy who had a recording of him using racially offensive language, authorities say.

Wilkins is accused of trying to get another man to kill former Deputy <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark>, who he believed was going to expose his racist talk .>> Read more trending news Wake County District Attorney Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark>, who is prosecuting the case, said Wilkins' Aug. 12, 2014, phone conversation with the \"well-known' man who threatened <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark>'s life was caught on tape, according to The News & Observer in Raleigh. Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> and <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark> are not related. <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark> worked for the Sheriff's Office from November 2011 to August 2014 but was let go in the days leading up to Wilkins' alleged crimes, WRAL in Raleigh reported.

The court records do not detail what Wilkins is alleged to have said, or what ultimately happened to the recording of his words. The indictment against the sheriff alleges Wilkins encouraged the man to \"take care of it' and said,\" The only way you gonna stop him is kill him .' According to the indictment, Wilkins counseled the would-be gunman on how to kill <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark> in a way to avoid getting caught.

He was also ordered to surrender his passport, if he has one. Read the indictment against Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins below. Brindell Wilkins Indictment by National Content Desk on Scribd \"No one is above the law,' Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> said Monday, according to WRAL .\" It is always painful when someone who has the public trust faces these types of allegations for voters who put them in that place. \"Any time you have someone who is sworn to uphold the public trust, to protect their community, to investigate and report crimes, allegedly engage in this type of conduct, it is something that needs to be brought to justice, and so we will continue to follow the evidence in this case .' Several followers of Wilkins' public Facebook page offered support in the wake of the indictment .\" You will always have our support,' one woman wrote. \"Praying for you and your family .'\" Our friendship goes back 30 years or more and you have always been a great friend to me,' another woman wrote. \"You were there for me many times. I believe in you and you have my support, always .' Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> said Wake County is handling the case because Mike Waters, her counterpart in Granville County, could potentially become an important witness at trial. Waters, who addressed the case in a statement on his office's Facebook page, wrote to Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> in November to ask her to look into the case. Watch Wake County DA Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> discuss the case below, courtesy of the News & Observer. WRAL reported that <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark>, who Waters represented in 2014 while in private practice, gave the future prosecutor the tape recording of Wilkins' conversation with the man who talked of killing the former deputy. It was not clear Friday how <mark>Freeman</mark> obtained the recording. Waters said he immediately turned the tape over to the FBI. The Washington Post reported that Waters met with North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agents about the recording in January 2017, but nothing happened .\" Quite frankly, it did not get to the top of their investigative list,' Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> told WRAL about SBI agents. Waters gave the recording to a different SBI agent in October 2018, but still, no investigation was initiated, the Post reported. That is when Waters turned to Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> to initiate a probe into the sheriff. She agreed .' I have reviewed this recording,' Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> wrote to SBI agents, according to the Post. \"It contains a conversation between two individuals, one of whom appears to be the Granville County sheriff, about a former deputy sheriff and culminates in a discussion about committing a homicide .' In his Facebook statement, Waters expressed frustration at the amount of time it took to get an investigation going .\" At all times since (turning over the recording), I have provided assistance to investigators, and once Ms. <mark>Freeman</mark> opened a criminal investigation, have urged that this matter be given investigative priority,' Waters wrote .' I understand it is a matter of great importance to the people of Granville County, and it has been a point of frustration that the investigative process has not been more expeditious .' He wrote that any allegations of wrongdoing by law enforcement are troubling, particularly when they involve a sheriff elected by the community. \"Over the next few months, my office will continue to lend assistance to the ongoing investigation as requested, while we continue to do our daily work of protecting victims, prosecuting those who violate the law and seeing that justice is administered,' Waters said. WRAL reported Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> said she worked to obtain obstruction charges against Wilkins because obstruction would be easier to prove in the five-year old case than solicitation of murder or conspiracy. The Granville County Board of Commissioners met Tuesday to discuss the indictment, but County Attorney Jim Wrenn said the board has no authority to remove Wilkins, an elected official, from office as his criminal case winds its way through the court system, WRAL reported. Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> confirmed that fact to the News & Observer .\" Technically, he can continue to serve if he chooses, until convicted,' <mark>Freeman</mark> told the newspaper. Spectrum News' Charlotte bureau reported that Wilkins has indicated he will not step down. Wrenn said he is considering trying to get Wilkins out of office through the courts but wants to hear the recording himself before making that decision. Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the North Carolina General Assembly, said state law has a provision allowing a judge to suspend a sheriff and allow a county commission to appoint a temporary replacement pending the outcome of a criminal case. \"The statute is there to allow removal of sheriff,' Cohen told Spectrum News .\" One of six causes is, in fact, conviction of felony. Others are some of the things in his indictment, like willful misconduct, corruption, willful neglect or refusal to perform duties of his office. Some of them match the charges in his indictment .' The News & Observer reported that the probe into Wilkins' alleged actions against <mark>Joshua Freeman</mark> has led to investigations of the Granville County Sheriff's Office's accounting practices, as well as the operations of its drug unit. <mark>Freeman</mark> was a member of the drug unit when he was with the agency. \"Part of this investigation has centered on why this sort of conversation would have occurred, what the underlying motivation would have been,' Lorrin <mark>Freeman</mark> said Tuesday, according to the newspaper .\" Additional information has come to light regarding operations and accounting practices of the Granville County narcotics interdiction team .'

Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump. It was the latest revelation in an escalating controversy that has created a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, which has refused to turn over the formal complaint by a national security official or even describe its contents. Trump is defending himself against the intelligence official's complaint, asserting that it comes from a \"partisan whistleblower,\" though the president also says he doesn't know who had made it. The complaint was based on a series of events, one of which was a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a two people familiar with the matter. The people were not authorized to discuss the issue by name and were granted anonymity. In a tweet Saturday, Trump referred to \"a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had\" with Ukraine's leader. \"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong .\" Trump, in that call, urged Zelenskiy to probe the activities of potential Democratic rival Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company, according to one of the people, who was briefed on the call. Trump did not raise the issue of U.S. aid to Ukraine, indicating there was not an explicit quid pro quo, according to the person. In an interview with Ukrainian outlet Hromadske that was published Friday evening, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said his country was not interested in taking sides in U.S. politics, but that Zelenskiy had the right to keep the contents of his conversation with Trump secret. \"I know what the conversation was about and I do not think there was any pressure\" from Trump, Prystaiko was quoted as saying. \"There was a conversation, different conversation, leaders have the right to discuss any existing issues. This was a long and friendly conversation that touched on a lot of issues, sometimes requiring serious answers .\" Biden said that if the reports are true, \"then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country .\" He said Trump should release the transcript of his July phone conversation with Zelenskiy \"so that the American people can judge for themselves .\" The U.S. government's intelligence inspector general has described the whistleblower's Aug. 12 complaint as \"serious\" and \"urgent .\" Trump dismissed it all Friday, insisting \"it's nothing .\" He scolded reporters for asking about it and said it was \"just another political hack job .\" \"I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,\" Trump said. \"At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country .\" Trump was asked whether he knew if the whistleblower's complaint centered on the July 25 call with Zelenskiy. \"I really don't know,\" Trump said. When questioned whether he had brought up Biden in the call, Trump said, \"It doesn't matter what I discussed .\" But then Trump urged the media \"to look into\" Biden's background with Ukraine. There has yet to be any evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son regarding Ukraine. Trump and Zelenskiy plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this coming week. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump pressed Zelenskiy about Biden. The standoff with Congress raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump's appointees are protecting the Republican president from oversight and, specifically, whether his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president. Democrats say the administration is legally required to give Congress access to the whistleblower's complaint, and Rep. Adam Schiff of California has said he will go to court in an effort to get it if necessary. The intelligence community's inspector general said the matter involves the \"most significant\" responsibilities of intelligence leadership. House Democrats also are fighting the administration for access to witnesses and documents in impeachment probes. In the whistleblower case, lawmakers are looking into whether Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to aid Trump's reelection effort by investigating the activities of Biden's son. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. He initially said, \"No, actually I didn't,\" but seconds later he said, \"Of course I did .\" Giuliani has spent months trying to drum up potentially damaging evidence about Biden's ties to Ukraine. He told CNN that Trump was unaware of his actions. \"I did what I did on my own,\" he said. \"I told him about it afterward. Still later, Giuliani tweeted,\" A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job. \"Democrats have contended that Trump, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, may have asked for foreign assistance in his upcoming reelection bid. Trump further stoked those concerns earlier this year in an interview when he suggested he would be open to receiving foreign help. The inspector general appeared before the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint. Schiff said Trump's attack on the whistleblower was disturbing and raised concerns that it would have a chilling effect on other potential exposers of wrongdoing. He also said it was\" deeply disturbing \"that the White House appeared to know more about the complaint than its intended recipient--Congress. The information\" deserves a thorough investigation, \"Schiff said .\" Come hell or high water, that's what we're going to do. \"Among the materials, Democrats have sought is a transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelenskiy. The call took place one day after Mueller's faltering testimony to Congress effectively ended the threat his probe posed to the White House. A readout of the call released from the Ukrainian government said Trump believed Kyiv could complete corruptions investigations that have hampered relations between the two nations but did not get into specifics. Sen. <mark>Chris Murphy</mark> of Connecticut, who in May called for a probe of Giuliani's effort in Ukraine, said in an interview on Friday it's\" outrageous \"the president has been sending his political operative to talk to Ukraine's new president. <mark>Murphy</mark> tweeted that during his own visit it was clear to him that Ukraine officials were\" worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani's demands. \"The senator tweeted that he told Zelenskiy during their August visit it was\" best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed. \"Letters to Congress from the inspector general make clear that Maguire consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It's unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said. Maguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by the House committee and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Maguire and the inspector general, <mark>Michael Atkinson</mark>, also are expected next week at the Senate Intelligence Committee. <mark>Atkinson</mark> wrote in letters that Schiff released that he and Maguire had hit an\" impasse \"over the acting director's decision not to share the complaint with Congress. <mark>Atkinson</mark> said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an\" urgent concern. \"And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director's jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional. <mark>Atkinson</mark> said he disagreed with that Justice Department view. The complaint\" not only falls under DNI's jurisdiction, \"<mark>Atkinson</mark> wrote,\" but relates to one of the most significant and important of DNI's responsibilities to the American people. \"___ Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Eric Tucker, Alan Fram and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington, D.C., and Matthew Bodner in Moscow contributed to this report.
