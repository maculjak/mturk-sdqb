Where the old ways still hold true .\" --John Marston New Austin is one of three territories in Red Dead Redemption and is also the largest. It is also known as the Frontier. Click to enlarge Contents [show] Description Edit This territory is characterized as a largely rugged and arid wilderness in the process of colonization. As such, there is an expected presence of wild animals and outlaws. The name of the region and its largest town as well as its border location, prominent fort, mines, and oil derricks all show a strong Texas influence. Geography Edit New Austin lies between Nuevo Paraiso to the south, and West Elizabeth to the northeast. It comprises four regions: Cholla Springs, Gaptooth Ridge, Hennigan's Stead, and R\u00edo Bravo. The terrain of New Austin resembles aspects of several real Southwestern U.S. states. Cholla Springs resembles Arizona's desert with its saguaro cactus, desert scrub, and prickly pears. The scrub desert of Rio Bravo is strongly reminiscent of New Mexico. Gaptooth Ridge is more like Southern California, Nevada, and western Arizona with its tan rocks and Joshua trees, and Hennigan's Stead resembles the western parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, central Colorado, and the square part of Texas called the Panhandle Plains, with the Eastern end (Stillwater Creek) resembling the United States The South comprising of Texas North Texas, Texas East Texas, and Louisiana.

Trivia Edit People in MacFarlane's Ranch and in Armadillo will mention Governor Nate Johns, suggesting that New Austin and West Elizabeth are located in the same territory; this is further evidenced by the lack of any government building in New Austin, but there are a few in West Elizabeth. The railroad tunnel between Hennigan's Stead and Cholla Springs and the snow capped canyon in north Hennigan's Stead are some of the few places in the game where the player is, technically, off the map. MacFarlane's Ranch is the largest settlement in the region, despite its status as a privately owned ranch. The racing track in Gaptooth Ridge is the westernmost point in the game. As with the boundary between New Austin and West Elizabeth, the transition of the music when the player moves between New Austin and Nuevo Paraiso can take some time to register.

Hillier crushed a drive and stuck a 4-iron to 6 feet on the 575-yard 18th hole, which runs alongside Lake Louise. He made the putt for an eagle. And shot 81. \"Kind of like making a 3 at the buzzer when you're down four, isn't it?\" sixth-year Kansas coach Jamie Bermel said. \"Didn't really matter. That's about the way our day went too .\" Precisely. When the Jayhawks walked off the course, they were in dead last, 21 over par, in the field of 30 schools with a chance of moving up because some schools were just getting started. Friday's rain delay forced KU to play one-and-a-half rounds Saturday. The players started teeing off at 7 a.m. after finishing past 8:30 p.m. Friday. The difficulty of the course, the short turnaround, the searing heat and the enormity of the stage combined to make this not just another Saturday on the golf course for the Jayhawks. So far, KU's two seniors have handled it the best. Daniel Sutton, the team's straightest driver, has shot 71-73 to enter Sunday's round at even par. Daniel Hudson shot 76-72 and is 4 over, battling back from a triple-bogey 7 on his first hole of the tournament, No. 10 on Friday. Sophomore Andy Spencer (72-78) is 6 over. Harry Hillier (76-81) is 13 over, junior Charlie Hillier 82-79) 17 over. After Sunday's round, the field will be trimmed to 15 schools and the eight best of those after Monday will advance to match play. Do you believe in miracles? KU has so much ground left to make up, which in many instances would mean taking more chances is the way to go, but Karsten Creek counterpunches so viciously that might not be wise. \"I just don't know if you can be real aggressive out here because you're going to get punched in the nose if you get overly aggressive,\" Kansas coach Jamie Bermel said. \"The holes where we made big numbers on, a lot of the guys hit 3-woods and couldn't keep it in play. That part of it we just have to get better at. A lot of courses we play you can hit a driver and if it goes wayward you can still find it. Not out here .\" Sutton, who came to KU from Birmingham, England, wants to go out in style. \"For me and Hud, potentially it can be our last round of college golf,\" Sutton said. \"We're going to give it our all .\" Sutton has no ambivalence about the approach with the team so far behind. \"Same as always,\" he said. \"We're going to keep it in the fairway. If the putts start to fall and and a bunch of us start making birdies, you never know what can happen. We just need to stick to the game plan of hitting it in the fairway, post a respectable score and see where that leaves us .\" Kansas is one of seven Big 12 schools competing. Texas Tech (-5), Oklahoma State (-4), Oklahoma (+2), Texas (+4) need to hold their positions in the field to make the first cut. Baylor (+21) is just two strokes ahead of Kansas, and Iowa State, which teed off later than the rest of the Big 12 schools, hovered right around the cut line in the early going of its second round. Hudson did a nice job of capturing what makes Karsten Creek such a difficult challenge to negotiate. \"You can hit good shots off the tee and you have to aim to where the wind's going to push the ball to the fat part of the fairway,\" Hudson said. \"And that's if you're comfortable over the shot. But if you don't feel like you have a consistent flight off the tee, you're standing up there on a hole that's 40 yards wide and if you don't hit it in that 40-yard gap, you're re-teeing .\" KU's second round was marred by four triple-bogeys and two doubles.

Williams won 7-6 (4), 6-4. Allessandra Tarantino/Associated Press Serena Williams of the U.S. reacts after scoring a point against Krystina Pliskova of the Czech Republic during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament Tuesday at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris. Allessandra Tarantino/Associated Press Krystina Pliskova of the Czech Republic returns a shot against Serena Williams of the U.S. during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament Tuesday at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris. Michel Euler/Associated Press Serena Williams of the U.S. serves against Krystina Pliskova of the Czech Republic during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament Tuesday at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris. Williams recorded 13 aces in the match. Michel Euler/Associated Press PARIS--For all that has changed in the 16 months since Serena Williams last played in a Grand Slam tournament--she is now married and a mother--so much was familiar about her at the French Open on Tuesday. The fashion statement, this time in the form of a black bodysuit with a red belt that she said made her feel like a \"warrior princess .\" The cries of \"Come on!\" The big serves that provided 13 aces. The returns that eventually produced three consecutive breaks of serve. And, yes, the victory. Competing as a mom for the first time at a major, and only about nine months since giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia, then dealing with postpartum complications, Williams edged 70th-ranked Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic 7-6 (4), 6-4 at Roland Garros. Already a transcendent sports star and cultural icon, Williams now carries a new title: working mother. \"Well, my priority is Olympia. No matter what, that's my priority. I have given tennis so much, and tennis has actually given me a lot, and I couldn't be more grateful,\" Williams said. \"She's my priority, and I work everything around her .\" The 36-year-old American had not played in one of tennis's biggest tournaments since winning the Australian Open in January 2017 for her 23rd Grand Slam title, breaking a tie with Steffi Graf for the most in the professional era. Williams, the world found out later, was pregnant at the time. Her baby was born Sept. 1; Williams married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in November. Williams eventually revealed that she had an emergency cesarean section, then encountered trouble breathing afterward because of a pulmonary embolism and needed a follow-up operation. \"Just literally not sure if I was going to make it or not at several different times,\" Williams said. \"A lot of people have really reached out, because they have so many similar stories, too. I feel like a lot of people don't talk about it. They talk about the baby and how happy they are. But it's a lot that goes into it with the pregnancy and with giving birth, and it's called a\" miracle' for a reason. \"The first match of her comeback was in doubles alongside her older sister, Venus, for the U.S. Fed Cup team in February. She entered two tournaments in singles the next month, going 2-2. An absence of more than two months followed, until Tuesday in Paris. So a woman who has spent hundreds of weeks ranked No. 1 is currently No. 451 and unseeded at the French Open, a subject of some debate: Should her past success accord her the protection a seeding offers? Williams faces 17th-seeded Ash Barty of Australia next .\" She's a genuine champion, \"Barty said .\" What she's done to be able to get back...is a pretty amazing thing. \"Tuesday's return was striking, from Williams' powerful shots to her outfit, which called to mind the\" catsuit \"she wore at the 2002 U.S. Open. It was by far the most significant event of Day 3 at Roland Garros, even though there were so many other Grand Slam champions in action. Rafael Nadal finished off a rain-interrupted victory as he begins his try for a record-extending 11th French Open title. Maria Sharapova, a two-time champ in Paris, was pushed to three sets in a win. Garbine Muguruza, who beat Williams in the 2016 final at Roland Garros, beat another past champion, <mark>Svetlana Kuznetsova</mark>. All eyes were on Williams, though. On the fifth point, she delivered an ace at 112 mph. Moments later, the chair umpire intoned,\" Jeu, Madame Williams, \"--French for\" Game, Mrs. Williams, \"a change from the\" Mademoiselle \"used for unmarried female players. Pliskova, a lefty whose twin sister upset Williams in the 2016 U.S. Open semifinals, actually hit more aces, 15. That's the most anyone has hit against Williams since at least 2008, according to the WTA. Indeed, Williams appeared to have trouble reading Pliskova's serves early on. There were other blips, of the sort to be expected from someone who hasn't played lately. Williams double-faulted seven times. She had nearly as many unforced errors, 25, as winners, 29. But she is not simply skilled. She is smart, too, and she figured things out. After trailing 3-0 in the tiebreaker, she reeled off six points in a row. After falling behind 2-0 in the second set, Williams came up with a trio of service breaks. All was not perfect, of course. In the final game, Williams' right foot gave way as she sprinted toward the net and she landed on her backside. At least she was able to laugh at that as she went to the sideline to towel off. A spectator yelled:\" That's all right, Serena! You still look great! \"After months of worrying more about diapers than drop shots, of breastfeeding for what she called\" a really, really, really long time, \"of organizing her practice schedule around her newborn's nap schedule, Williams was back to doing what she's most famous for, in an arena where she earned trophies in 2002, 2013 and 2015. On Tuesday, she noted that she showed up at her news conference more promptly than she used to, so she could have more time to spend with Olympia .\" I don't want her to ever feel like I'm not around. I'm a super hands-on mom, \"Williams said .\" Maybe too much. \"A reporter wanted to know whether Williams believes she can win the title again .\" I'm definitely here to compete and do the best that I can do, obviously. I'm not putting any pressure on myself as I normally do, \"Williams began. Then, perhaps questioning her own words as she heard them, she paused, before adding with a laugh:\" I think deep down, we all know the answer to that. \"Serena Williams wins in Grand Slam return at French Open Serena Williams of the U.S. clenches her fist after scoring a point against Krystina Pliskova of the Czech Republic during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament Tuesday at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris.
