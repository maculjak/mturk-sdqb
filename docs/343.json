COMING THIS WEEK: EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION--Debate and a likely vote on the House's take on equal pay legislation which passed the Senate unanimously is expected to appeal to all sides thanks to tweaks from the House. More from yours truly in POLITICO Massachusetts--\"While the House language was not yet available late last week, those involved with negotiations say the bill will be amenable to all parties. It is currently being tweaked in the House Committee on Ways and Means .\" ...\"\"I would say that it's similar to the Senate version,' said Rep. Patricia Haddad, a Somerset Democrat. The main difference, she said, is that the House worked more closely with Associated Industries of Massachusetts in developing the legislation .\" ...\"In January, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to shrink the gap between men and women's wages by prohibiting potential employers from asking about salary history and establishing a definition for\" comparable work. \"'\" Associated Industries of Massachusetts, or AIM, was critical of the Senate's language. The group's president, Rick Lord, confirmed that his team has been closely working with House leadership as well as the Attorney General's office \"to hopefully come up with a bill out of the House that we would support .\" '...\"The Massachusetts High Tech Council, another group pushing back against the Senate proposal, sent a similar signal .\" Based on the conversations we've been having, we're optimistic about the House-produced bill. It will be an improvement over what the Senate did,' said public policy and communications executive vice president Mark Gallagher. \"READ ON--http: //politi.co/29ssPOE Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Massachusetts has one of the cleanest and lowest carbon-producing power generation systems in the nation. In fact, transportation today represents twice the carbon emissions of power plants in the Commonwealth. And despite talk of an \"energy cost crisis,\" the last two years have seen the lowest electricity prices in more than a decade. The energy plan being pushed on Beacon Hill, however, puts all this progress at risk by outsourcing up to a third of our electricity market to government-owned Canadian utilities and locking consumers into decades-long hydro contracts. If passed by the legislature, energy bills are estimated to increase by up to $777 million each year for Massachusetts families and businesses. Government-owned Canadian hydro is expensive, unreliable and not the solution for Massachusetts. Learn more: bit. ly/2928S3h ** Want to make an impact?

Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee that oversees the election, said <mark>May</mark> was the only remaining candidate to become Tory leader. She will be confirmed as the new Conservative Party leader after consulting the board, Brady said. The contest will not re-open, he added. In a speech earlier on Monday, <mark>May</mark>, 59, a remain-campaigner, reiterated that there will not be a second referendum on EU membership. \"Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it\" , she said. In the June 23 referendum, 52% Britons voted to leave the EU in a surprise and historic move. It remains unclear whether the confirmation will come by the end of Monday or this week. After party confirmation, <mark>May</mark> must meet the Queen, who will return to London only tomorrow or Wednesday. <mark>May</mark> will likely meet the Queen during teatime. The final result of the Tory leadership election was set to be announced on September 9. Brady suggested that now it will not take that long for the announcement. While announcing his resignation in the aftermath of the \"Brexit\" vote, Prime Minister <mark>David Cameron</mark> had said he will continue until October and that the exit talks with the EU should continue under the new PM. Reports suggest that <mark>Cameron</mark> will take his last Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, and hand over the role to <mark>May</mark> afterwards. <mark>May</mark> is a known face for the EU. In her campaign manifesto, she said the Article 50, which governs the EU exit process, will not be triggered this year. She has also ruled out a general election before 2020 and abandoned the target of achieving a budget surplus by that year. Her stance on the status of EU nationals living in the UK has attracted criticism. She has only said that they will be part of the \"Brexit\" negotiations, refusing to guarantee that they can remain in the country. Earlier on Monday, Leadsom bowed out from the race, saying she lacked \"sufficient support to lead a strong and stable government\". She had less than 25% backing of MPs. She also said that it was in the interests of the country that a new strong PM is appointed immediately. \"A nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable,\" she said. With over 60% of Tory MPs' backing, <mark>May</mark> is \"ideally placed to implement\" Brexit \"on the best possible terms for the British people and she has promised that she will do so\" , the energy minister said. Leadsom's withdrawal came after she faced severe criticism for her comments in an interview in the Times last week, which implied that being a mother gave her a \"real stake\" in Britain's future. <mark>May</mark> is childless and Leadsom texted an apology to her on Monday, reports said. Responding to Leadsom's withdrawal, <mark>May</mark>'s campaign manager Chris Gayling said her statement showed she is a \"true public servant\" and a decent person. <mark>May</mark> is set to make a statement later on Monday. Prominent \"Leave\" campaigner Boris Johnson called for quick transition of the PM role to <mark>May</mark>. The former London mayor had quit the Tory leadership bid after his close ally Michael Gove launched a surprise bid. Gove, who was eliminated from the race last week, also sought a quick handover of the leadership to <mark>May</mark>. Following the Tory news, Labour called for a general election. \"It is crucial, given the instability caused by the Brexit vote, that the country has a democratically elected prime minister,\" Labour's Election Coordinator Jon Trickett said. \"It is time for the Labour party to unite and ensure the millions of people in the country left behind by the Tories' failed economic policies, have the opportunity to elect a Labour government .\" However, unity in the Labour party seems a distant prospect for now. Leadsom's announcement coincided with Labour MP Angela Eagle's launch of her bid for the Labour Party leadership. \"These are dark times for Labour,\" Eagle said in a statement announcing her formal challenge to Jeremy Corbyn leadership. \"And they are dangerous times for our country .\" Corbyn had publicly declared that he will remain as the Labour Party leader \"come what <mark>may</mark>\" , allowing crucial talks with unions to find a solution to the crisis fall apart. \"Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership this huge task needs,\" Eagle said. \"I believe I can .\" Labour Party General Secretary <mark>Iain McNicol</mark> confirmed that there will be a contest for the leadership position. Like the Conservatives, the main UK opposition party has also witnessed chaos after the surprise \"Brexit\" vote. Several members of the shadow cabinet, including Eagle, quit in a revolt against Corbyn leadership. The crisis also led to a no-confidence move against Corbyn that he lost. Eagle, 55, has been the MP for Wallasey. She is openly gay and has championed social causes such as smoking bans, hunting ban and same sex marriages. She had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU.

A rainfall warning was in place Monday from Prince Albert, south to the U.S. border. Environment Canada said heavy downpours could cause flash floods, water pooling on roads and flooding in low-lying areas. And even parts of northern Saskatchewan have been hit, with a secondary highway near La Ronge being washed out, and a state of emergency being declared in Carrot River. Saskatchewan emergency management commissioner Duane McKay said communities should be prepared. \"Obviously, some of these issues will impact individuals, so we've notified our provincial disaster assistance team and they are ready to go with any help that municipalities might require there as well,\" McKay said Monday in Saskatoon. McKay also said there's a large cache of flood equipment, such as barriers and pumps, in southern Saskatchewan from flood responses in 2011, 2012 and 2014. \"The province is well provisioned in terms of making sure that, in the event of a flood in any community that requires equipment, the entire equipment from start to finish would be available. And it's on trailers, so it could be rapidly deployed to particular areas .\" Humboldt saw flooding on Sunday and a state of emergency was declared in Estevan when roads and basements were left under water by storm sewers unable to handle at least 130 millimetres of rain that fell in just over two hours. McKay said he hopes the worst is over for Estevan. \"All of the infrastructure, although it was overwhelmed, seems to be keeping up with the removal of the water through lift stations and so on,\" he said. \"So although it's very dramatic when you see the photos of rivers where streets should be, the systems are working and are beginning to clear that water out of that area. Most of the water in those low-lying areas will cause some damages .\" On Monday morning, the sky was blue as friends of Brooke White, who lives in an Estevan trailer court that was badly flooded, ferried in supplies for her in an inflatable dinghy. But by supper time, storm clouds started moving in again, and people were nervously watching the sky. The Red Cross has provided 300 cleanup kits to Estevan, which includes a mop, sponges, brooms, gloves and supplies to safely clean flood-damaged homes and property. Estevan resident Janet Foord, who was returning home when she was caught driving in the storm, said intersections were flooded and vehicles had water up to their mirrors. \"It took me about 20 minutes to get from the highway to my house, which usually takes about four minutes, just because I couldn't find a dry spot or a high spot to go down without stalling our vehicle,\" said Foord. Foord said her neighbours' homes are flooded and the underground parking garage in a condo behind her house is filled with water. \"You could see stuff floating as I walked by .\" People trying to get water out of their basements also faced a challenge when the power went out Sunday, because they needed generators to run their sump pumps, Foord said. SaskPower spokesman <mark>Jonathan Tremblay</mark> said the storm took out a transformer for about half the city's 11,000 residents. Most of the power was restored in about 4 1/2 hours, <mark>Tremblay</mark> said. But as of Monday there were still outages \"here and there\" because poles were in water or lines were knocked down by branches. \"It's slow going to send crews out and safely repair those things, especially with all the water on the ground,\" said <mark>Tremblay</mark>. Some roads also flooded in several other communities, including Lloydminster and Yorkton. Alan Cayford, Lloydminster's director of public works, says the official amount recorded at the airport weather station was 63 millimetres. \"It was a pretty intense and tight-web system that did this to us,\" said Cayford. Yorkton Mayor Bob Maloney said his city got about 51 millimetres of rain Sunday night and water pooled on some streets. Yorkton isn't covered by the rainfall warning, but Maloney was apprehensive. \"If we get more rain on top of what we had yesterday, we could have issues,\" said Maloney. Yorkton improved drainage from downtown after some 1,000 homes damaged when heavy rain floods basements and turns streets into canals in 2010. Maloney says since 2010, there have been three or four storms \"where it just doesn't stop raining\" and residents are leery. \"We have bad memories. When it rains at night, I swear to God everybody in Yorkton gets up and looks out the window. We're scarred .\" --By Jennifer Graham in Regina, with files from CTV Saskatoon", "articleID": "2016071206_00343171_W", "names": {"Jonathan Tremblay": ["Q3183483", "Q3183486"]}}, {"date": "2016-07-12", "url": "http://krcrtv.com/news/politics/house-republicans-grill-loretta-lynch-over-clinton-emails/40469788", "content": "Home House Republicans grill Loretta Lynch over Clinton emails Republicans have asked DOJ to investigate Clinton for perjury By Eugene Scott CNNPOSTED: 49 mins UPDATED 42 minsText Size: Would you like to continue watching?

In many ways, this behavior should be expected of \"the <mark>Donald</mark>,\" who has been well-known for his overinflated ego and bombastic statements for years. However, what what less expected is that other, more serious Republican presidential contenders would defend him. From Mother Jones: During an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said, \"I salute <mark>Donald Trump</mark> for focusing on the need to address illegal immigration .\" ...Rick Santorum also came out on #teamtrump. The former senator told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday that he did not like <mark>Trump</mark>' s \"verbiage,\" but said that <mark>Trump</mark> \"focused on a very important issue for American workers, and particularly legal immigrants in this country .\" Referring to the storm that followed <mark>Trump</mark>' s remarks, Ben Carson contended that political correctness was overshadowing the debate about immigration reform. \"It' s the P.C. police out in force,\" Carson told the Daily Caller. \"They want to make very clear that this is a topic you' re not supposed to bring up .\" Naturally, these more seasoned politicians would make <mark>Trump</mark>'s statements more palpable by reverting to talking points about immigration, but that's not what he was talking about. He explicitly called Mexican immigrants rapists. It should come as no surprise that the so-called \"PC Police\" would be upset when painting an estimated 11.6 million people with such a broad and dark stroke with the only qualification that \"some, I assume, are good people .\" Sadly, <mark>Trump</mark>'s ignorant statements have not just been rewarded by his fellow presidential contenders but the voters as well. The <mark>Donald</mark> leading the latest Economist/YouGov poll at 15 percent, which seems to confirm a popular talking about the American right: conservatives lack empathy. Is this really how we talk about our fellow man in 2015? Calling strangers rapists for trying to make a better life for their family?

RELATED STORIES Philippines' top nickel ore producer sees flat shipments, better prices this year The Philippines is the biggest exporter to top metals consumer China of nickel ore, used to make stainless steel. A smattering of smaller mines are likely to be affected in coming months and new mines will probably face tough going in the future, but the review of the mining sector is not likely to result in a quick drop in shipments. \"The Chinese think the Philippines will continue exporting ore to China and only some small mines will be affected. They're not worried about the situation at the moment,\" said Peter Peng, analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing. The biggest Philippine producer, Nickel Asia Corp., which has already complied with international mining standards, accounted for close to 40% of Philippine nickel ore production last year, according to analyst <mark>David Wilson</mark> at Citi in London. Three other major miners also say they have approvals, while small-scale miners only accounted for about 11% of ore produced last year, he added. \"We therefore suspect that the impact of environmental license suspension may be more limited than initially feared, and believe the recent rally will run out of steam,\" he said in a note. Of the 40 operating mines, 21 have obtained their ISO 14001 certification, said Ronald S. Recidoro, Legal & Policy vice-president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines. POPULAR ANGER Benchmark nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange have rallied a fifth to eight-month highs since June 4 when incoming President Rodrigo R. Duterte warned mining companies to \"shape up\". What remains unknown is how tough the mining minister, Regina Paz \"Gina\" L. Lopez, a committed environmentalist, will be in enforcing environmental and social responsibility rules. Days after she assumed office on June 30, a review of all mines was launched and two small mines were suspended. Analyst Jim Lennon, a consultant for Macquarie, said politicians in the Philippines were responding to public anger at damaging practices in the small-scale mining sector. \"Small miners are stripping away the overgrowth and the forestry and mining down 5-10 meters (yards), but don't bother replacing the overburden and replanting,\" Lennon said. Philippine nickel ore exports to China were already down this year before the crackdown, due to low prices and as some mines ran out of ore. \"Exports are down 25% in the first half anyway, because of the price and reserve exhaustion, so if any of the mines were to be shut down, there's still plenty of capacity,\" Mr. Lennon said. \"So my feeling is that there will be more of an impact on new mines because I think there will be a much more extended environmental approval process .\" The Philippine government has halted permits to develop new mines since 2012 while it works out ways to get more revenue from the sector, but such efforts in Congress have stalled .--Reuters E-mail |", "articleID": "2016071415_00910319_W", "names": {"David Wilson": ["Q11320682", "Q167028", "Q16849502", "Q19594138", "Q21453228", "Q26329468", "Q2642471", "Q27683615", "Q28914261", "Q29033812", "Q29643806", "Q30122994", "Q3018168", "Q3019005", "Q3703375", "Q39071263", "Q39073912", "Q42841755", "Q5234991", "Q5241195", "Q5241198", "Q5241199", "Q5241202", "Q5241203", "Q5241205", "Q5241209", "Q57025576", "Q676969"]}}]
