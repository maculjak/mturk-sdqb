The player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, jumped out of a hotel room wearing only his underwear after being filmed with a woman who was not his partner. He had previously met Natalie Wood, 28, on two occasions after contacting her on social media and arranged to meet her for a third time last year. Wood, along with three men, allegedly hatched a plot to blackmail the sportsman by filming \"incriminating\" footage of him in bed with her. Bristol Crown Court has heard the plan was formed after Wood revealed her liaisons with the footballer to former Take Me Out contestant Tyrone Coleman, 34. <mark>Simon Jones</mark>, prosecuting, told jurors that messages between the defendants, and Wood and the player, had been examined by police as part of the investigation. In one voice message sent before the incident, Rowe told Tyrone Coleman: \"...been plotting this for too long to be taken out of the equation\". Coleman replied: \"[The footballer's] days are numbered. It is what it is fam. The dirty **** .\" Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to \"keep him enticed and draw him in\". Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should \"play it smooth--make him want this now\". She sent the player a number of \"provocative\" messages ahead of their meeting, <mark>Simon Jones</mark>, prosecuting, said. \"The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is--it is all a sting,\" Mr <mark>Jones</mark> told the jury. In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: \"Something I'm hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you? As well as it benefits all of us I know .\" READ MORE Lenny Henry tells audience: I am Justin Trudeau Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player--discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room--to Rowe. The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged \"general chit chat\" on social media before meeting at a hotel. He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived--sending him the room number in a message. On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed \"nervous\" and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were \"only going there for one thing\". \"All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room,\" he told jurors. \"One of the guys said something like:\" Is this what you are doing?'. It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged. \"I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was .\" The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived. His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it. Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai. The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, 37, who was charged with handling stolen goods. After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Wood's phone, stating that he had been in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\" and telling him to contact a number. \"I don't really want to expose you to the media but if you don't respond within 24 hours then you leave me no choice,\" it said. When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: \"Obviously it is blackmail .\" That's what they wanted to do--to get footage of me and take it to the papers. \"Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner .\" I had previously asked him if he did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I asking if he was single, \"she said .\" I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, it's not right. \"She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money .\" He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, \"Wood told the court .\" The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room. \"READ MORE Emiliano Sala's sister calls pair\" wicked' for accessing mortuary footage She said it did not go to plan as the footballer \"jumped out of the window\" before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.

(between 3 and 11 percent of americans older than 65 have dementia .) studies have found, norcross noted, that approximately one-third of doctors don't even have a personal physician, who might be on the lookout for deteriorating hearing, vision or motor coordination, or the cognitive impairment that precedes dementia. the effects of aging \"doctors are not immune to the effects of aging,\" norcross said, adding that the onset of dementia is often insidious and gradual. too often, he said, health problems become impossible to ignore after a catastrophic event, such as the death of a patient. \"doctors with cognitive and neurological problems almost never have insight into their problems,\" he said, and many deny that anything is wrong. while few experts would argue that age alone should control who can continue to practice, some studies suggest that doctors' skills tend to deteriorate over time. a 2006 report found that patient mortality in complex operations was higher among surgeons older than 60 than among their younger colleagues. to address the problem in a systematic way, a small but growing number of hospitals - including the university of virginia health system, stanford hospital and clinics, and driscoll children's hospital in corpus christi, texas - have recently adopted policies requiring doctors over a certain age - 70 at u-va. and driscoll, 75 at stanford - to undergo periodic physical and cognitive exams as a condition of renewing their privileges. diane pinakiewicz, former president of the national patient safety foundation, a boston-based information and advocacy group, calls the policies \"a fabulous idea\" that is long overdue. \"without a rule, it's left to someone's personal decision\" to self-monitor. new hampshire health-care consultant jonathan burroughs, who has worked with hospitals seeking to implement testing policies for older physicians, estimates that roughly 5 to 10 percent of institutions have adopted them and that interest is growing. \"colleagues have a code of silence,\" said burroughs, who spent 30 years as an emergency department physician. during his career, burroughs said he followed several elderly doctors around, quietly correcting their orders to prevent mistakes. such experiences, he said, are nearly universal in medicine. \"most medical staffs look the other way, thinking,\" there but for the grace of god .' this person has been a good doctor, and we're not going to betray them, \"burroughs said. but that kindness can backfire, he added, subjecting patients to potentially disastrous consequences such as serious injury or death, and the faltering physician to a malpractice suit or the loss of a medical license. john schorling, a professor of medicine who heads u-va .'s physician wellness program, said the policy adopted last year was prompted by\" general concerns \"about patient safety and is modeled on aviation industry practices .\" pilots have people's lives in their hands, and so do doctors, \"he said .\" fred flintstone' care but some hospital administrators dispute the need for such testing. fitness to practice, they maintain, is already paramount in decisions that hospitals make every two years or so to renew a physician's privileges. and that process, they say, has gotten more stringent in the past decade with the proliferation of performance data on doctors. \"in medicine, i think you need to look at people individually,\" said david mayer, 59, vice president of quality and safety at medstarhealth, the largest hospital network in the district and maryland. \"to just put a number there and say,\" you need to be looked at more closely' because of age is not justified. \"<mark>brian johnston</mark>, chairman of the emergency department at white memorial medical center in los angeles, agrees .\" it's just very hard to make a hard-and-fast rule based on age, \"said <mark>johnston</mark>, 74, who is still pulling regular shifts in the fast-paced specialty. testing everyone who hits a certain age is\" unnecessarily ham-handed. \"but marty makary, a johns hopkins surgeon and author of\" unaccountable: what hospitals won't tell you and how transparency can revolutionize health care, \"says that screening can weed out those who should no longer be practicing while giving\" those who are fully functional the freedom to practice without the stigma of ageism. \"although an older doctor can be a font of wisdom and experience, makary warns that too often patients receive what he calls\" fred flintstone care \"from doctors whose skills have not kept pace .\" some older surgeons are all over minimally invasive surgery, \"he said,\" but many have just ignored minimally invasive techniques. \"their patients, he said, may receive state-of-the-art care - for' 76. orthopedic surgeon ralph blasier agrees. in a 2009 review article entitled\" the problem of the aging surgeon, \"blasier wrote that\" essentially every treatment technique taught 25 years ago has been abandoned and replaced, \"including the treatment of traumatic fractures and joint diseases .\" all surgical specialties, \"he continued,\" have had similar turnover of treatment methods. \"blasier, 62, who practices in escanaba, mich., has cut back his practice in recent years. he no longer performs certain demanding operations, such as arthroscopic shoulder surgery, because he doesn't think he does them as well as he did at age 50, when he was at his peak. one reason blasier believes doctors are loath to retire is that they haven't planned for it. five years ago, he earned a law degree from wayne state university and is handling several legal cases, in addition to his reduced surgical practice. in a few years when he retires, he plans to practice law .\" if i screw up a legal case, \"he said,\" nobody dies. \"at stanford, weinacker, chief of the 1,800-member medical staff, said that reaction to the policy, which affects about 25 doctors, has been mixed. several doctors, she said, have decided to retire instead of undergoing testing .\" i think the main thing i stressed with people was that this policy is intended to be supportive, \"not punitive. anyone found to have problems will be referred to the pace program for a more complete evaluation. at u-va., schorling said that 28 of the 35 doctors older than 70 completed screening and passed easily. the other seven decided against participating and no longer have hospital privileges there, although they are free to practice elsewhere. still practicing at 101 rheumatologist ephraim engleman, who will turn 102 in march, said he plans to never quit. one of the nation's oldest practicing physicians, engleman drives from his san mateo home to the sprawling medical campus of the university of california at san francisco three days a week. there he sees about eight longtime patients per week and spends most of his time directing the rosalind russell medical research center for arthritis, an administrative post he has held since it was created in' 79 .\" i'm very much opposed to retirement, \"said engleman, an accomplished violinist who plays once a week with a chamber music group .\" as long as i'm able intellectually and physically, i'm going to continue. \"engleman, who graduated from medical school in' 37, loves being a doctor and said,\" i can do everything i ever did. \"his only impediment, he said, is severe spinal stenosis, which has left him stooped and dependent on a cane .\" i walk like an old man, \"he said."}, {"articleID": "2018041008_00086024_W", "names": {"Amar Shah": ["Q16223949", "Q58806795"], "Elizabeth Moss": ["Q54573547", "Q6152388"]}, "date": "2018-04-10", "url": "https://in.news.yahoo.com/why-fans-upset-latest-episode-080249344.html", "content": "Many 90s kids have known the struggle of picking the best episode of The Simpsons, the longest-running scripted series in TV history. Over a decade later, the fans are wiser. They stand evolved and have mixed feelings about some of the problematic depictions. The stealthy stereotypes and racist depictions of the character, Apu - the Indian owner and manager of the Springfield Kwik-E-Mart, prompted Hari Kondabalu an Indian-American fan of the classic comedy series to release a documentary titled The Problem with Apu. Hank Azaria, a non-Indian actor lent his voice replete with an Indian accent to the animated series. Azaria's performance as Apu was based on a guy who worked at the 7-11 in Los Angeles back in the late 1980s - the result was a caricature. In one of the interviews, Kondabalu asserted that Apu is predominantly \"a white person's perception of an Indian immigrant .\" He's not the only fan who is grappling with this conflict. Kondabalu argued that the stereotyping provoked bullying of and racism towards people of colour. The latest episode of the series, titled No Good Read Goes Unpunished finally addressed the criticisms around the character but not without being defensive. In the episode Marge decides to update a book she loved as a girl, The Princess in the Garden before introducing it to Lisa to make it more relevant to the times, to strip it off any traces of misogyny and racism and to make it \"politically correct'. #TheSimpsons completely toothless response to @ harikondabolu #TheProblemWithApu about the racist character Apu:\" Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect...What can you do? \"pic.twitter.com/Bj7qE2FXWN--Soham (@ soham_burger) April 9, 2018 The new version fails to fascinate Lisa .\" Well, what am I supposed to do? \"Marge inquires exasperated.

What can you do?\" \"- Lisa in the latest episode of The Simpsons She then glances at her nightstand, on which a framed photo of Apu is perched, emblazoned with the caption,\" Don't have a cow! \"Marge also indicates that there's no point to the book after the revision. The response was perceived as flippant, at best by Twitterati, who agree that The Simpsons jumped the shark long ago. The aforesaid documentary released last year had ignited a conversation on how Apu's depiction as a character fails to stand the test of time. The facile jab didn't go unnoticed by Kondabalu who jumped into the discussion online. Wow .\" Politically Incorrect? \"That's the takeaway from my movie & the discussion it sparked?

one governed by its own homeowners' association - recently gave the bird to one of the development's most outspoken chicken lovers, caroline vierow, who runs a facebook page called clucs, or chicken lovers united communityof stapleton. in early february, the stapleton neighborhood #7 hoa, which governs about 100 residences built by kb homes, rejected a request by vierow and her husband, dane, to build a fence and a chicken coop in their back yard. the association said that a coop would\" detract from the harmony of the association \"and went on to explain that\" the board feels that, while chickens are allowed by the city and county of denver under certain criteria...they do indeed attract predators, have a potential for the nuisance of smell, and do not fit into the overall feeling of the community of stapleton #7. in addition, the board feels that allowing a chicken coop could negatively affect the marketability of neighboring homeowners. \"the vierows were surprised .\" stapleton prides itself on being very sustainable and green, \"caroline says .\" there are a lot of people here who have chickens. the master community association doesn't prohibit chickens; they're fine with them. that's why we were so taken aback when the hoa came back with this. \"the association added that the vierows' back yard was also small, and pointed out that forest city, stapleton's master planner, is currently marketing a new housing development -

fact usually triumphs over fiction - except on tv news. the major networks have been obsessed with manti te'o's fantasy football story of a fictional girlfriend. but when 500,000 people showed up in washington to speak out for the unborn, it was barely a footnote. abc, cbs, and nbc devoted close to two-and-a-half hours (147 minutes and 43 seconds) to the te'o fiasco and just 17 seconds to the washington, d.c., march for life. that's 521 times more coverage for te'o and a girlfriend who never even existed. abc covered the story of the notre dame's linebacker for 63 minutes and 57 seconds, while nbc came close with 59 minutes and 15 seconds. cbs was rational by comparison with just 24 minutes and 31 seconds. the anchors reported on te'o with gluttony for more detail. abc's dan abrams made a convincing argument for less coverage on the january 23, \"good morning america .\" that argument clearly failed. \"and, hard to believe that we don't learn any new details. i mean, remember, this story has broken almost a week ago, and we've learned very little new since that happened .\" yet abc led all three networks with more than one hour of coverage. the anchors continued to talk, decorating the controversy with ornamental descriptions. nbc's willie geist called the te'o account \"so compelling\" and abc's george stephanopoulos described it as \"that bizarre love story .\" neither spared even a second for those marching to prevent another 55 million babies from dying in the next 40 years after roe v. wade. between the threads of the te'o story, one anchor, nbc's <mark>brian williams</mark> devoted 17 seconds to the 40th march for life on last friday, january 25, saying: \"back in this country, in washington today, thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators marched to the steps of the supreme court, protesting the landmark decision that legalized abortion. annual march for life, as it's called, this year, coincides with the 40th anniversary of the roe v. wade decision .\" the networks have a history of bias concerning the march for life. the lack of coverage of the march became even more impressive when half a million people attended. a spokesperson for the eternal word television network (ewtn), \"the largest religious media network in the world,\" confirmed that organizers interviewed on ewtn estimated 500,000 marchers. thoughtful, respectful comments that add useful, additional information or insights directly related to the stories lsn commenting is not for on-going debates or theological or other disputes between commenters. it is also not a place for hobby commenters to post numerous comments promoting their personal agendas. multiple comments from one person under a story are discouraged (suggested maximum of three). lifesitenews gives priority to pro-life, pro-family commenters since this is an alternative news service founded to give fair and accurate information on life, family and culture issues which are very poorly covered in most mainstream media. lifesitenews reserves the right to edit or remove comments that do not meet the standards noted above. 2,000 + youth learn the nuts and bolts of pro-life activism at students for life conference networks give 521 times more coverage to manti te'o than march for life morally straight? the transformation of the boy scouts of america doctor in canada's lone \"abortion-free' province found offering chemical abortions: report gvmt minister rona ambrose:' i believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare .' healing, not scarlet letters, promoted at national pro-life prayer service before march for life cuomo's extreme abortion bill creates a civil war with democrats, catholics (124) a post-abortive mother's response to the' i had an abortion' t-shirt (111)"}, {"articleID": "2014073018_00052101_W", "names": {"Jim Mcdonald": ["Q18379036", "Q27915165", "Q47545518", "Q6196786", "Q6196792"], "David Somers": ["Q15526573", "Q16196708", "Q43275382"], "Dan Wallace": ["Q17501740", "Q5214548"], "Henning Berg": ["Q123303", "Q343093"], "Tommy Wright": ["Q3531369", "Q7820025", "Q7820027", "Q7820028", "Q981825"]}, "date": "2014-07-30", "url": "http://dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/callum-davidson-tells-grieving-st-3935163", "content": "Watch hilarious video of Northern Irish mum shouting at her daughter when she doesn't know how long to go 80 miles at 80mph Rangers hero Shota Arveladze wins gruelling legal battle to evict tenants who fell \u00a3 42k behind on rent payments Serial pervert was caught in street sex act but still left free to rape and kill OAP Rosina Orlando Bloom throws PUNCH at Justin Bieber outside Ibiza restaurant Liam Neeson opens up about heart-wrenching moment wife Natasha Richardson's life support was turned off Coronation Street legend Charlie Lawson happy to bring <mark>Jim McDonald</mark> back -

The Saints No. 2 has been charged with preparing the team after <mark>Wright</mark> returned to Northern Ireland following the death of his mother May. <mark>Wright</mark> won't fly back to Scotland until hours before kick-off but Davidson has assured him it will be business as usual on the training ground in the run-up to the Europa League first-leg qualifier. Last season he stepped up to the plate when the Ulsterman underwent gall bladder surgery and was ordered to steer clear of McDiarmid Park during his recuperation. So Davidson has no fears about taking over before the Slovakian side pitch up in Perth. He said: \"It's a little bit different to when <mark>Tommy</mark> was in the hospital. The main thing at the moment is he's with his family, especially his dad .\" They have the funeral to get through and then he'll be back on Thursday. So it's not a problem. \"We have been in constant contact. <mark>Tommy</mark> was the same when he was in hospital - he wants to know everything that's going on .\" He has asked for videos of Spartak Trnava to be sent to him back home. So he'll be watching them, working out the setplays and stuff before speaking to the lads when he's back. \"We'll do a chunk of prep work before the game. We'll sit down with the players and go through some videos we have .\" The good thing about that is things will be fresh in their minds. \"After showing great character to see off Swiss side Luzern in the last round Saints are determined to keep the Euro adventure going. And Davidson believes they are so professional the absence of <mark>Wright</mark> won't be felt in training. He said:\" The boys take care of themselves anyway - you rarely see a bad training session. \"They know what's expected of them and what they expect from themselves. The fact the manager isn't here won't impact on things one bit .\" The boys will make sure their standards are kept high in training. They always do that. \"But Davidson admitted compiling a dossier on the Slovaks has been more challenging than the homework they did on Luzern. The former Scotland full-back said:\" Our scout Ewan Peacock was over watching their last European game so we have a report on them. \"We're also speaking to people who have played Spartak .\" It has been more difficult to get info on them than it was for Luzern but we'll get there. \"They'll be physical. They get the ball forward quickly and are strong at the back. So it's a different test to last week against Luzern .\" It's similar to the Minsk game last year when we lost on penalties after winning away. \"The one thing I would say from the game against the Swiss is we need to improve on our ball retention. We want to be better on the ball .\" If we can keep it tight at home and take our chances then we will have something to take to Slovakia. \"Not losing an away goal would be huge so we'll have that in mind .\" Davidson expects another bumper crowd at McDiarmid Park with fans able to pay at the gate and is thrilled the squad has a clean bill of health.
