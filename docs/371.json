[{"date": "2017-04-02", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/417882973.html", "content": "GLENDALE, ARIZ.--North Carolina's <mark>Roy Williams</mark> was the only coach in the Final Four that had been there before--and his program has an NCAA record 20 appearances in the national semifinals. That type of experience and tradition made the Tar Heels the clear favorite Saturday over Oregon, but it took them until late in the first half to wake up and play like a potential champion. Trailing by eight points in the first half, North Carolina was shooting just 25 percent from the field. The only reason it wasn't getting blown out was because of the play of Kennedy Meeks, who finished with 25 points and 14 rebounds. And Meeks' offensive rebound on a missed free throw in the closing seconds eventually helped the top-seeded Tar Heels barely escape with a 77-76 victory over No. 3 seed Oregon to advance to their second straight NCAA championship game. \"If it wasn't for Kennedy Meeks, we wouldn't have been in the basketball game,\" <mark>Williams</mark> said. \"It's a dream come true to get there. Now we've got to play better .\" Tyler Dorsey's three-pointer followed by a layup from <mark>Keith Smith</mark> cut it to 77-76 with seven seconds left in the game. Meeks missed two free throws with 5.8 seconds left, but Theo Pinson tapped the ball out to put his team on the line once again. David J. Phillip & #x 2022; Associated Press Oregon forward Jordan Bell fought for a rebound with North Carolina guard Stilman White during the first half. Joel Berry clanked the front end of a 1-and-1, but Meeks was there for the clutch carom to seal it. <mark>Williams</mark> will be vying for his third national title and first since 2009 when North Carolina (31-7) plays Gonzaga on Monday night. Jackson also had 22 points for the Tar Heels. \"We're moving on,\" said Jackson, who finished with 22 points. \"We'll get back in the gym tomorrow and probably work on a lot of free throws, but we're just happy to move on .\" Dorsey finished with 21 points and Dylan Ennis had 18 points for the Ducks (33-6), who were making their first Final Four appearance since 1939. That's when they won the inaugural crown. An all-West Coast final would've been intriguing. But Oregon was playing from behind after leading early. Meeks' dominance in the post kept his team within striking distance before a late surge helped the Tar Heels take a 39-36 lead into halftime. Meeks had 14 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first half, while the rest of his team shot just 8-for-28 from the floor. Dorsey had just four points on 0-for-4 shooting in the first half. All-American Dillon Brooks wasn't that much better with just six of his 10 points on 2-for-7 shooting and four of his team's 12 turnovers by halftime. The Ducks stayed in the game by winning the rebounding battle early. Even without 6-10 center <mark>Chris Boucher</mark> (knee injury) in the NCAA tournament, they were tough to keep off the glass because of double-double machine Jordan Bell. Bell finished with 13 points and 16 rebounds. But he needed help battling in the paint Saturday. The Tar Heels' size eventually gained them the edge on the boards. The top rebounding team in the nation finished with 19 second-chance points on 17 offensive rebounds Saturday. Meeks opened the second half scoring twice on offensive rebounds, including an emphatic putback dunk. But he went to the bench with three fouls at 14:44. The Ducks, though, failed to take advantage of his absence. They couldn't stop Jackson. Jackson scored eight straight points during one stretch. After a few minutes, Meeks returned and immediately made his presence felt. After a missed free throw, Pinson grabbed the offensive rebound and found Meeks for a layup to take a 66-56 lead. It was basically a two-man show Saturday, but North Carolina's run to a second straight NCAA title game wouldn't have been possible without sixth-man Luke Maye's jumper with 0.3 seconds left in a 75-73 win against Kentucky in the Elite Eight. That was a fitting way to advance since the Tar Heels suffered a heart-breaking loss in last year's national championship game on a buzzer-beating three from Villanova's <mark>Kris Jenkins</mark>.", "articleID": "2017040205_00471292_W", "names": {"Kris Jenkins": ["Q24005501", "Q6437191"], "Roy Williams": ["Q17414660", "Q18391329", "Q18706111", "Q21035306", "Q2170754", "Q30716994", "Q321623", "Q3445837", "Q3445839", "Q7373500", "Q7373502", "Q7373504", "Q7373505", "Q7373506"]}}, {"date": "2017-04-05", "url": "http://www.ktvq.com/story/35071088/bill-would-prohibit-enforcement-of-federal-ban-on-firearms-in-montana", "content": "Bill would prohibit enforcement of federal ban on firearms in Mo - KTVQ.com | Q2 | Continuous News Coverage | Billings, MT Bill would prohibit enforcement of federal ban on firearms in Mo - KTVQ.com | Q2 | Continuous News Coverage | Billings, MT Member Center: Bill would prohibit enforcement of federal ban on firearms in Montana Posted: By Freddy Monares - UM Legislative News Service HELENA - The House of Representatives gave preliminary approval Tuesday to a bill meant to preserve Montanans' right to bear arms by prohibiting the enforcement of any federal ban on firearms or ammunition. The House passed Senate Bill 99 on a 60-40 vote. It will be up for a final vote on Wednesday. The bill passed out of the Senate in February on a 30-20 vote before moving to the House. It would establish the \"Montana Federal Firearm, Magazine and Ammunition Ban Enforcement Prohibition Act .\" Rep. Seth Berglee, R-Joliet, is carrying the bill in the House for Sen. <mark>Cary Smith</mark>, R-Billings. \"We did add a couple of amendments to it to allow for federal assistance, as long as it is not for the primary purpose of prohibiting, restricting or requiring any of the federal bans,\" Berglee said. At the bill's first hearing in the House Patrick Audet, lobbyist for the School Administrators of Montana, opposed the bill and said it would allow firearms on school campuses. \"If an officer couldn't enforce that law, that would be a problem. We would be opposed to that,\" Audet said. Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association, said Audet is referring to a federal act called the \"Gun-Free School Zones Act .\" The act prohibits anyone from openly carrying a loaded firearm (one that's not properly stowed) within 1,000 feet from school grounds. Marbut supported SB 99 and said past legislation already exempts Montana from that law. \"The Legislature passed a statute, frankly that I wrote, that said because we have the right to keep and bear arms in Montana every law-abiding adult is deemed to be licensed by the state, pursuant to the federal\" Gun-Free School Zones Act, \"' Marbut said. Marbut said the only other ban for firearms on school grounds is a different one called the\" Gun-Free Schools Act, \"in which the federal government encourages each state to introduce their own laws for firearms on campus. He said since that ban would be considered a state law, a school resource officer's enforcement of the state's ban would not be affected by the bill.

Caracas-based Petroleos de Venezuela SA told investors that principal and interest payments related to its bond that matures this month will be available in investor accounts on April 12, the company said in an emailed statement. It added that it had already started transferring coupon payments for other bonds that mature in 2027 and 2037. The weeks leading up to the payment had seen volatile price swings in bond prices as investors worried a deteriorating political situation could influence the country's ability or willingness to repay its debt. The country's dollar bonds fell the most in two years on March 31 as an ongoing dispute between the government of President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition-controlled National Assembly worsened and resulted in street protests in Caracas. Those same bonds rallied the most in three months on Thursday after Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica said in a report that PDVSA officials agreed to continue paying their debt obligations during a high-level meeting with counter-parties at the finance ministry and central bank. Both Maduro and his economy czar Ramon Lobo said ahead of the payment that the country would continue to honor its foreign debt obligations. \"Do you think we would have been better off in default?,\" Maduro told a business group in Caracas on March 23. \"Let's think of the national interest, of our land. There continue to be insipid people who attack Venezuela from the inside and outside when we all must unite in a single effort to work .\" Investors will now be waiting for government data to see if PDVSA needed to use central bank reserves to make the payment.

(c FlaglerLive) Joseph Bova was off his meds. To say that of the accused killer of store clerk Zuheili Roman Rosado at a Palm Coast gas station in 2013 is not a metaphor, an exaggeration or a put-down. Today, when Bova appeared before Circuit Judge Dennis Craig for the first time in nine months, it was a fact: he had not been taking his psychotropic medication at the Flagler County jail. He had not been doing anything but remain on his bunk, sleeping. It showed. In his last appearance in July, he was trim, almost shaven, had a crew cut and was vivacious enough to keep his head up and speak briefly, politely and somewhat normally to the judge (Matthew Foxman was on the bench in Flagler then). His lawyer, Ray Warren, even said he could be ready for trial later in summer. He wasn't. When Bova walked into court this afternoon, he looked like a wild creature brought in from the wilderness: exploding hair, unkempt beard, baggy eyes he kept closed most of the time, head bent, back bent. He looked as if he would have shuffled even without leg shackles. And that was the better part of him today. When he spoke, it got worse. On several occasions, he threatened Craig that he would be killed in a matter of seconds, that four people in the building would die, that he was being held hostage and that the judge had only one choice: to let him go, or else. Craig was asking him simple questions, among them whether Bova himself felt competent to go to trial. Bova would not answer them. He'd repeat his threats, or make incomprehensible statements as he stood next to Warren. \"Sir I'm threatening your life,\" he told the judge at one point. \"As I understand he's not taking his medication in jail,\" Assistant State Attorney <mark>Mark Johnson</mark> told the judge. Warren has been trying for months to get Bova again declared incompetent to stand trial. The state had initially resisted, particularly last summer, when Bova acted more rationally, and after he had spent a stint in a state psychiatric facility. There, the question of his competence had revolved around Bova's authenticity. Prosecutors doubted that he was truly incompetent. Rather, that he purposefully acted strangely in order to prolong his stay at the psychiatric facility, or to delay his trial. All along, he'd make allegations that people who would try to help him would be harmed--not by him, but by someone, or something. Today, he threatened harm himself. When Craig opened his conversation by asking Bova how he was, Bova at first said he was \"pretty good, sir,\" before immediately correcting himself. \"Actually, not so good .\" He then spoke of an \"emergency going on,\" and \"some kind of game that's very important .\" He said he had to be let out to deal with the emergency. Craig asked Bova why he continues to refuse to talk to a doctor, as he has at the county jail. \"There's no need to talk to a doctor,\" Boval said. \"So you voluntarily decided not to talk to the doctor?\" the judge asked. Bova, whenever he wasn't speaking, would look down and to his left, as if suddenly oblivious to his surroundings. Even after the judge asked his questions, Bova would remain in that posture, as if he hadn't heard the question, or didn't want to answer. But he would then come out of that state, lift his head and answer, without quite making sense. He answered the judge's question by mouthing something about President Barack Obama and the courthouse, suggesting that he wasn't aware that there had been an election. \"Do you understand what the counsel is saying today about finding you incompetent?\" the judge asked. \"Oh, sir, that's just an irrelevant practice that's trying to delay things,\" he said. \"So you'd rather not be found incompetent?\" \"I'm looking for a bail immediately,\" Bova replied, \"or there's going to be a serious problem .\" The judge repeated his question about competency. Long silence. Then: \"Sir there's going to be a death to at last four people in this building,\" he said, if the judge didn't let him out. When Craig asked him if he at least understood what he was asking him, Bova repeated that he was being held hostage. Asked again, he told the judge: \"You have seven seconds to respond the way you're supposed to, sir .\" \"All right, let me ask you again,\" a patient Craig said, \"do you think this issue of competency or incompetency--\"\"There' a death toll to at least four more of your council friends if you do not respond responsibly the way you're supposed to,\" Bova replied. A sheriff's deputy stood two feet behind him, three others stood in a corner, closer to the judge, though they did not look any more alarmed than the judge. The room was full of people waiting their turn in an afternoon of pre-trials, jaws closer to the ground than usual for a court audience. He refused to answer questions, calling them \"irrelevant .\" He then got rude, questioning the judge for not responding to his own questions. But at that point, the judge said he'd agree to declare him incompetent for now. What that means is that for the first time in over a year, Bova will return to a psychiatric hospital, where he may be forced to take medication, even if it takes injections against his will. The local jail could not do so without doctors' orders, nor would it want to expose itself to liability. In one instance, he was Baker Acted from the jail, thus ensuring that he would be medicated, at least temporarily. The hospital is required to send a report to the judge every six months. Based on those reports, the case will be reopened, and competency again considered.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla ., reforming the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. On Wednesday, Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) unveiled a Web video, calling on <mark>Nelson</mark> to back Rubio's \"VA Accountability First Act .\" <mark>Nelson</mark> has supported similar legislation in the past. \"How many more veterans will die waiting for care at the Department of Veterans Affairs?\" the narrator of the ad asks. \"How many more will be neglected by the people hired to serve them? How many more will suffer before the Senate acts?\" CVA Executive Director Mark Lucas weighed in on why his group was running the new ad. \"Senator <mark>Nelson</mark> has supported strong VA accountability measures in the past, and there should be nothing stopping him from doing so now,\" Lucas said. \"The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 will help Secretary Shulkin get rid of the bad VA employees who drive a toxic culture and fail to give our veterans the care they need. Veterans shouldn't have to suffer at the hands of incompetent or negligent VA employees. We urge the Senate to prioritize sending the VA Accountability First Act of 2017 to President Trump's desk .\" CVA is running similar ads across the nation, urging swing state Democrats who are expected to face competitive races next year, including <mark>Nelson</mark>, to support the legislation. Other swing state Democrats targeted include U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana. Rubio teamed up with U.S. Rep. <mark>Phil Roe</mark>, R-Tenn ., the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, to bring out the <mark>bill</mark> at the start of March. This is not a new subject for Rubio who had been pushing for reforming the VA, often teaming with then U.S. Rep. <mark>Jeff Miller</mark>, R-Fla ., who chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee, on the issue. With both Rubio and <mark>Miller</mark> leading the charge, Congress passed a reform measure in 2014 after reports emerged about veterans dying after being placed on altered waiting lists while seeking medical treatment from VA facilities, including those in the Phoenix, Arizona area. In the aftermath of these reports, few VA employees lost their jobs after the scandal broke though then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned his post under fire. According to his office, Rubio's new proposal \"would provide improved protections for whistleblowers; empower the VA secretary to reduce an employee's federal pension if they are convicted of a felony that influenced their job at VA; allow the VA secretary to recoup a bonus provided to an employee who engaged in misconduct or poor performance prior to receiving the bonus, or recoup any relocation expenses that were authorized for a VA employee only through the employee's ill-gotten means, such as fraud, waste or malfeasance .\" \"For far too long, incompetent and uncaring employees at the VA have been allowed to fail at their jobs but still keep them,\" Rubio said when he brought out the proposal last month. \"In the past, we've passed measures to institute accountability but lacked a president and VA secretary who would actually implement them and fire VA employees who are failing our veterans. Now it's time to finally provide our veterans with the quality, efficient health care they have earned and deserve, instead of protecting the big labor unions seeking to keep the status quo of incompetence and malfeasance .\" The VA Accountability First Act will give the VA secretary increased flexibility to remove, demote, or suspend VA employees who fail to take care of our veterans, \"Rubio added .\" I am pleased President Trump has made this issue a priority, and I look forward to working with Secretary Shulkin to hold VA employees at all levels accountable for their performance and ensure our veterans are no longer ignored or mistreated. \"", "articleID": "2017041214_00673657_W", "names": {"Bill Nelson": ["Q22639331", "Q3272899", "Q358437", "Q4910326"], "Jeff Miller": ["Q30981158", "Q43459095", "Q6174508", "Q6174513", "Q6822669", "Q746834", "Q970478"], "Phil Roe": ["Q1665842", "Q7182346"]}}, {"date": "2017-04-12", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/republicans-almost-lost-ks-because-no-one-likes-their-agenda.html", "content": "A worse way. Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images Last night, a pro-choice Democrat--who proudly aligned himself with a self-avowed socialist--almost won the House district where Koch Industries is headquartered. Back in November, Kansas's fourth district backed <mark>Donald Trump</mark> by 27 points, and then-GOP congressman (now, CIA Director) Mike Pompeo by 31. Five months later, Republican Ron Estes needed a visit from Ted Cruz, a robocall from the president, and an infusion of national money to secure a seven-point victory over the aforementioned Democrat, <mark>James Thompson</mark>, a Wichita civil rights lawyer who'd never held public office. That 24-point swing wasn't enough to shake the red off Kansas. But if Democrats can swing every congressional district by half that sum, they'll take back the House in 2018. Naturally, Republicans are eager to paint last night's vote as an anomaly--one that says less about their party's national liabilities than its local ones. Kansas's GOP governor Sam Brownback boasts a woeful 27 percent approval rating, thanks, in large part, to gaping holes in the state's budget. Ron Estes was Brownback's state treasurer. In other words: Estes wasn't just running as a member of an unpopular governor's cabinet, but as the one most closely tied to Brownback's biggest failure. If anything, the fact that the treasurer of a state with wrenching budget problems won at all is a testament to the Republican Party's vitality! This is fine! America is already great again! There are a couple problems with that story. To name the most obvious: The past three months have been replete with evidence that the Democratic base is highly mobilized. You can see it in the record-setting marches, town hall protests, massive traffic enjoyed by leftwing Facebook pages, the tight special election race in Georgia's sixth district, and in the $150,000 that the liberal blog, Daily Kos, convinced its readers to pony up for <mark>James Thompson</mark>'s long-shot campaign. But okay: Let's ignore all that. Let's stipulate that last night was all about Brownback. That would certainly offer vulnerable House Republicans short-term comfort. But in the long run, a repudiation of Brownback is just as--if not more threatening--to the Republican Party than a repudiation of Trump. Sam Brownback isn't unpopular for idiosyncratic, personal reasons. The governor didn't decimate his state's finances by spending public funds on sex workers; he did it by implementing the conservative movement's blueprint for utopia. Some readers may be familiar with the legend of the \"red state model,\" but for those who aren't, here are the Cliff Notes: The 2010 tea-party wave delivered Brownback to the Sunflower State's governor's mansion and Republican majorities to both houses of its legislature. Together, they passed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and repealed all income taxes on more than 100,000 businesses. They tightened welfare requirements, privatized the delivery of Medicaid, cut $200 million from the education budget, eliminated four state agencies and 2,000 government employees. In 2012, Brownback helped replace the few remaining moderate Republicans in the legislature with conservative true believers. The following January, after signing the largest tax cut in Kansas history, Brownback told the Wall Street Journal, \"My focus is to create a red-state model that allows the Republican ticket to say,\" See, we've got a different way, and it works. \"' The GOP's national leadership agreed: Voters should look to Kansas to see the Republican vision for the nation's future .\" This is exactly the sort of thing we [Republicans] want to do here, in Washington, but can't, at least for now, \"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of Brownback's Kansas. And the supply-side nostrum undergirding the governor's economic model--that massive tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves, via heightened economic growth (provided that you kick the undeserving poor out of their welfare hammocks)--is the same one on which all of <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>'s celebrated budgets are based. Of course, the GOP's\" different way \"didn't work. Instead of providing national Republicans with a winning advertisement for fiscal conservatism, it provided Kansas's government with giant revenue shortfalls, its economy with weaker job growth than neighboring states, and Brownback himself with one of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in America. For decades now, Republicans have been asking voters to trade pieces of their social safety net for stronger economic growth. Kansas took them up on that offer. It allowed its government to throw more than a thousand disabled Kansans off of Medicaid, cut millions from the state's university system, and, in some of its districts, shorten the K-through-12 school year. Here was their reward. No state economy has done worse over the last 5 years than right-wing paradise Kansas. https: //t.co/rWPjwqo17r pic.twitter.com/3AYsgQHMqZ--Bruce Bartlett (@ BruceBartlett) October 26, 2016 To say that Kansas didn't swing against the GOP because of Trump--but only because of Brownback--is to say that red America isn't souring on one particular Republican, but only on their party's entire economic philosophy. Last year, the Republican Party nominated a man who campaigned on a promise to deliver universal health-care, preserve Social Security and Medicare, and intervene in the free market to protect American jobs. Last month, Republicans in the Kansas legislature passed a bill to expand Medicaid in their state. President Trump has never been popular. But his approval rating began sliding in early March, right after <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> unveiled his plan to finance a large tax cut for the rich by throwing millions of low-income people off of their health insurance--an idea that enjoyed the backing of 17 percent of the electorate. Turns out Tea Party voters want more government healthcare spending, yet support <mark>Ryan</mark>'s healthcare bill.
