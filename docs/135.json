Conforto, a rookie who did not face <mark>Young</mark> during his relief outing in the 14-inning opener, pulled an 87 mph pitch 395 feet into the right field upper deck. Wilmer Flores singled, ending an 0-for-10 Series start, advanced on a wild pitch and was sacrificed to third by Mets starter Steven Matz. Curtis Granderson hit a 254-foot fly ball to right. Rios caught it and took a casual step toward Kansas City's dugout, apparently thinking it was the final out of the inning. In the middle of his second step, he threw to the plate, but not in time to get Flores coming home from third. Kansas City asked umpires to check whether Flores left third base early. After a video review of 2 minutes, 22 seconds, the safe call on the field was allowed to stand .--8:50 p.m. Toronto's Josh Donaldson, speaking at the Hank Aaron Award news conference, was asked how he came up with his \"BringerOfRain\" Twitter handle. \"It was actually a series called\" Spartacus: Blood and Sand, \"he said .\" And the main character's name, Spartacus, and he becomes a gladiator. To make a long story short, he's fighting this guy, his name is Theokoles. He's a legend in the ring. The story is he's been stabbed a thousand times. I mean, it's crazy. To say the least, Spartacus ends up defeating him and killing him, and their country was in a drought at the time. And after he was able to defeat him, the rain had been brought. So he was called Spartacus, \"Bringer of Rain .' I thought it was pretty neat, so I stole it .\" --8:30 p.m. Edinson Volquez remains scheduled to start Game 5 for the Royals following his father's death, pending a conversation with manager Ned Yost. The pitcher was in the dugout for Saturday evening's Game 4 at Citi Field. \"I've got to sit down and talk to Edi. But we're still planning on him pitching tomorrow,\" Yost said before the game. \"He'll be here tonight, yeah. He should be here anytime .\" Volquez started the Series opener Tuesday night, hours after his father died. Volquez said he learned about his father's death when he stepped off the mound after allowing three runs over six innings. He then flew home to the Dominican Republic. \"These are huge games. Edi's been with this team all year long. He's worked so hard to get to this point,\" Yost said. \"And it was like <mark>Chris Young</mark> when his dad passed away. <mark>Chris</mark> just knew how proud his dad was of him and that his dad would want him to carry on. His dad would want him to be on that mound and helping his team win. And I imagine that Edi's dad would want the same thing .\" Volquez's father, 63-year-old <mark>Daniel</mark> Volquez, died of heart failure .--8:27 p.m. Toronto's Josh Donaldson won the American League's Hank Aaron Award and Washington's Bryce Harper was voted the NL honor. The award, established in 1999, is given to the most outstanding offensive performer in each league as determined by fans and a panel of' Hall of Famers selected by Aaron. Donaldson hit .297 with 122 runs, 41 doubles, 41 homers and 123 RBIs as the Blue Jays reached the playoffs for the first time since winning the 1993 title. Harper batted .330 with 118 runs, 38 doubles, 42 homers and 99 RBIs .--8:17 p.m. Well, plate umpire <mark>Jim Wolf</mark> came out firing. Known for a good arm--his brother is big league pitcher Randy Wolf--he tried to fire a strike when Royals starter <mark>Chris Young</mark> took the mound to begin the bottom of the first inning. Instead, Wolf tossed it right past the 6-foot-10 righty. Wolf wound up again and his second throw was right on the money. <mark>Young</mark> and Wolf seemed to smile, enjoying the moment .--8:04 p.m. Starting pitchers Steven Matz and <mark>Chris Young</mark> are ready to throw. So is plate umpire <mark>Jim Wolf</mark>. Wolf is known around baseball for tossing sharp strikes back to the pitcher after foul balls. It makes sense--his brother is major league pitcher Randy Wolf. This is Wolf's first year working the World Series, and this is his first plate job. A former pitcher in college, the right-hander was set. \"If my elbow cracks on my first throw, I'm good,\" he said. \"I'm ready. I'm here, I got to try it out .\" --6:45 p.m. Ruben Tejada thinks Chase Utley's late slide that broke his right leg was dirty. Speaking about the play for the first time since Utley ended Tejada's season in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets shortstop said he's no longer upset over it. Using a blue cane adorned with a Mets logo giving to him by the team's owners, Tejada hung out with teammates in the dugout before Game 4 of the World Series. He says he's come to terms with what happened, even though he never responded to the message Utley sent him through captain <mark>David Wright</mark>. Tejada may never respond to Utley. But he's not angry. \"I'm really happy we're here and he's home,\" Tejada said. Tejada said he needs to be in a walking boot for two more weeks, but vows he'll be ready for spring training .--6:40 p.m.. If the scouting report on <mark>David Wright</mark> was to go after him with hard stuff, <mark>Wright</mark> made the Royals pay for that approach in Game 3. The New York Mets' captain hit a two-run homer in the first inning on a 96 mph fastball from Yordano Ventura. According to Major League Baseball's PITCH f/x computer, that was the second home run on a pitch of 96 mph or greater that <mark>Wright</mark> hit since it began tracking data in 2007. The other was against Atlanta closer Craig Kimbrel in 2013. <mark>Wright</mark> added a two-run single on a 97 mph fastball from reliever Kelvin Herrera in the sixth .--6:30 p.m. Noah Syndergaard's high-and-tight fastball to Alcides Escobar was still a hot topic before Game 4. The rookie's first pitch Friday night for the Mets was a 97 mph heater just off the inside corner and above the head of a ducking Escobar. The ball sailed all the way to the backstop, and the Kansas City shortstop went down to the dirt on his rear end. Royals players shouted angrily at Syndergaard from the dugout. After the game, the <mark>young</mark> right-hander made it clear the pitch indeed had a purpose--to make Escobar and the rest of the Royals uncomfortable in the batter's box. Syndergaard had alluded Thursday to having \"a few tricks\" up his sleeve for the aggressive Escobar leading off the game. \"I didn't expect him to throw a strike, but I didn't expect him to throw it under his chin, either,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"But we've got a few tricks up our sleeves, too .\" The 6-foot-6, 240-pound Syndergaard said he certainly wasn't trying to hit Escobar. \"If they have a problem with me throwing inside, then they can meet me 60 feet, 6 inches away. I've got no problem with that,\" he said. Yost said throwing near an opponent's head is too dangerous, even if the intent is not to hit him. \"You can end a player's career by not intentionally hitting them in the head,\" the manager said. Yost views the chest as the dividing line these days for what's acceptable when pitching inside. \"You've seen us at times with <mark>Daniel Murphy</mark> pitch in on him, but it's never been up and in,\" Yost said. \"It was an acceptable thing to be able to move guys away, up top. And we've kind of gotten away from that now .\" Mets manager Terry Collins thought Syndergaard's purpose pitch set a tone. \"Hey, look, we're in this World Series, too, and we're going to get after it,\" Collins said, adding it showed Syndergaard is \"not afraid of anybody .\" Collins called pitching inside \"a lost art\" and acknowledged \"guys take a huge offense to it .\" \"But I still think it's got to be part of the game,\" Collins said."}, {"articleID": "2013022714_00054404_W", "names": {"Mary Walsh": ["Q3296255", "Q58120228", "Q6780910", "Q6780911", "Q6780914"]}, "date": "2013-02-27", "url": "http://cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2013/02/26/nl-rnc-rcmp-synthetic-marijuana-227.html?cmp=rss", "content": "new n.l. police say synthetic weed illegal police in newfoundland say they would investigate, test samples of suspicious product last updated: feb 27, 2013 10:24 am nt police in newfoundland and labrador agree that synthetic marijuana is illegal, and if there was suspicion of it being sold over the counter in local stores, they would launch an investigation. cbc news bought herbal incense from two local stores - <mark>mary</mark> janes smoke shop in downtown st. john's and the chad smoke shop 420 in mount pearl. the product was sold under brand names like fusion warped, fusion fission, zap \"r, and kick ass white rabbit. the zap' r herbal incense blend has this label on the back of the package.

He is a native of Kendallville. Outside the White House, no one knew the name of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee until minutes before Judge Brett Kavanaugh stepped into the East Room. And yet on the most important question of all--the judicial philosophy of the nominee, whomever the president had chosen--the event was mercifully free of suspense. From the outset, we all knew that to be considered by Trump, any prospective justice would have to be a judicial conservative, understanding that courts exist to interpret our Constitution and laws without venturing to set national policy. In his 2016 campaign, the president again and again promised to appoint justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia. And now, for the second time, he has delivered exactly that. Over 12 years as a federal appeals court judge, Kava-naugh's opinions reflect a clear understanding of the judicial role under the Constitution. This is a judge who has firmly defended the separation of powers as designed by the framers; consistently adhered to the Constitution and laws as written; and left political issues to the executive and legislative branches, where they belong. He has authored more than 300 opinions for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Not one of them displays an impulse to overreach, grandstand or achieve any objective beyond a fair decision in the case at hand. At the appeals level, one measure of a judge's influence is how often his or her reasoning is later adopted by the Supreme Court. This has happened at least 11 times with opinions by Kavanaugh. In fact, some of those opinions were dissents that the high court found more persuasive than the majority view of Kavanaugh's circuit court colleagues. And whatever side the judge was on, his position rested on the clearest of principles. As he said on the night of his nomination, \"A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law ....A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent .\" As one of the founding directors of the Federalist Society, I of course agree with him because that philosophy is faithful to the vision of the framers. This does not mean I can predict how a Justice Kavanaugh would rule in any given case. Indeed, two of the court's most conservative members, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, do not always come down on the same side, even when applying fundamental constitutional principles. It does mean that Kavanaugh would not use his judicial powers to reach a desired result or to create rights not found in the law or traditions of our country. Should Kavanaugh be confirmed by the Senate, his modest, Constitution-based approach to judging would be the prevailing one on the Supreme Court, a turn of events no one on the political left was expecting just two years ago. For decades, liberal activists have depended on federal courts to further agendas that have little or nothing to do with constitutional law, and that would go nowhere if pursued by democratic means. These endless judicial power plays have brought deep divisions to the country. Now, so very suddenly, the winds have changed and the era of judicial supremacy is coming to a close. This explains the spreading panic in progressive circles over an obviously well qualified nominee. Lacking serious objections, all that Senate Democrats will have against Kavanaugh are menacing caricatures and hysterical warnings--tactics likely to work as well as they did against Justice Neil Gorsuch. As the nomination advances, it will be little noted that Trump's model justice, Scalia, was confirmed by a unanimous vote, as was the departing Justice <mark>Anthony Kennedy</mark>. That's a reminder of a time when obvious merit made for a straight path to confirmation. We're now in a different day, when Senate Democrats are reduced to vowing, as Minority Leader Charles Schumer has put it, to resisting the nominee \"with everything I've got .\" The need for such bluster, however, only draws attention to what Kavanaugh's got--which is, by every measure, the ability, temperament and character we should all expect in a Supreme Court justice."}, {"articleID": "2010021906_00077159_W", "names": {"Sir John": ["Q28124344", "Q45996744"]}, "date": "2010-02-19", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/stories/021910/fea_564847494.shtml", "content": "one almost feels sorry for director joe johnston, who parlayed his work as an art director on the original \"star wars\" trilogy into increased budgets and respect as a director of family-oriented movies. the wolfman': hollywood horror classic reduced to shaggy dog story in remake by william kerns | a-j entertainment editor story last updated at 2/19/2010 - 12:10 am one almost feels sorry for director joe johnston, who parlayed his work as an art director on the original \"star wars\" trilogy into increased budgets and respect as a director of family-oriented movies. his attempt to remake george waggner's 1941 \"wolf man\" is little more than an ineffective overdose of cgi effects, gore and body parts, none of which are frightening. the shame is that johnston had so skillfully avoided r-rated products to this point. he made studios money with 1995's \"jumanji\" and \"jurassic park iii\" in 2001. and his best efforts are 1991's \"the rocketeer\" and the critically acclaimed \"october sky\" in 1999. all shine when compared to this new horror film. but then, who could blame johnston for jumping at the offer, especially with universal pictures ready to hand him a $100 million budget? unfortunately, \"the wolfman\" appears to have eaten up a half decade of his life, with little positive to show for it. indeed, the film is never clever or scary. those hoping to see a nightmarish \"wolfman\" most likely will just leave bored. to johnston's credit, even the studio's revolving release dates between 2007 and 2010 did not stop him from at least attempting to stress atmosphere and mood over pacing and blood. his fog machines never lost power, giving one the impression that things have been wrong for quite some time at talbot hall. mere candlelight is strong enough to reveal <mark>sir john</mark> talbot (anthony hopkins) taking no notice of cobwebs hanging from the staircase. the family has issues. that much becomes clear even before benicio del toro's lawrence talbot reveals affection for his late brother's wife, and recalls how his father committed him to life inside an asylum for a year as a child. a return to that asylum provides medicinal torture, only serving to make one look forward to martin scorsese's \"shutter island .\" more than once, hopkins welcomes del toro home as a \"prodigal son,\" but this is hardly preparation for the ridiculous departure taken by the screenwriters in the film's final conflict. production design and danny elfman's music score are proof that johnston at least put some thought into homage as much as horror. opening subtlety is lost quickly. there is no mystery, in fact, not when hopkins spends years locking himself behind bars in the family crypt during years of full moons. performances are disappointing overall. the villagers' combination of fear and superstition is well acted, but hopkins mails in his own performance and del toro cannot drum up enough believable passion even during his most important transformation. emily blunt is forgettable as the woman who attracts the love of two brothers. faring only somewhat better is hugo weaving as the scotland yard officer who actually asks, \"do you have any silver bullets?\" during a foot pursuit. photo credit: frank connor / uni / ap (l to r) lawrence talbot (benicio del toro) is taunted by <mark>sir john</mark> talbot (anthony hopkins) in the action-horror inspired by the classic universal film that launched a legacy of horror,?

Discussing Venezuela, the U.S. official said militaries in Latin America often \"handled\" transitions from bad governments, but insisted he was not advocating \"regime change .\" \"If the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he's got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there,\" Tillerson said, referring to 55-year-old Maduro, who has a close relationship with Cuba's communist government.

REUTERS/Henry Romero Many opposition leaders would love for Maduro to seek exile abroad. The former bus driver and union leader is widely disliked in Venezuela due to a brutal economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition, disease and mass emigration. But even some anti-government activists fear Washington's heavy-handed approach will only foster unity between the Socialist Party and the armed forces, as they would be loathe to seem to be taking orders from Washington. The U.S. comments will likely also cause unease in capitals of Latin America, where memories are rife of U.S. backing for right-wing dictators during the Cold War. That could hamper Tillerson's ability to reach a consensus on Venezuela during his trip. Senior military leaders have consistently stood by Maduro, whom critics accuse of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and wrecking its economy. But discontent among the rank-and-file, especially at their own economic penuries, is evident. There have been some small uprisings against Maduro from within the security forces. A National Guard captain led an attack on a barracks but was later arrested, and a police helicopter pilot lobbed grenades at government buildings but was tracked down and killed last month. Venezuela's opposition leaders have long urged the military to take action to force Maduro to follow the constitution. He maintains the United States and opposition parties are part of an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him and get their hands on the OPEC nation's oil wealth. Trump has himself suggested possible military intervention in Venezuela, though that was widely rejected in Latin America. Trump has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government, accusing it of rights abuses and corruption. Venezuelan officials say Tillerson is particularly bitter towards them because he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp when late leader <mark>Hugo Chavez</mark> nationalized one of its oil projects in the South American nation a decade ago.

Yet for all the vitriol, <mark>Brown</mark> may not be the purest critic. Obamacare is an offshoot of Romneycare, which <mark>Brown</mark> supported as a Republican state lawmaker in Massachusetts. That gives <mark>Brown</mark> the same problem Mitt Romney had while running for president in 2012: explaining why he likes and still defends a health reform law packed with mandates in Massachusetts while declaring its central elements unfit for the nation. <mark>Brown</mark> insisted in an interview that although Obamacare is\" the biggest issue in New Hampshire \"he is not taking health care cues from Romney .\" He's not told me anything, \"he said .\" I haven't talked to anybody about it. I understand the issues and do my own research. \"Yet <mark>Brown</mark> is not reticent about enlisting Romney to make his case, including a fundraising appeal highlighting the very topic that confounded Romney's own candidacy .\" The only way to get rid of Obamacare once and for all is to get rid of the Obamacare Democrats who forced it upon the American people in the first place...starting with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, \"Romney wrote on <mark>Brown</mark>'s behalf. No candidate's political identity is more intertwined with Obamacare than <mark>Scott Brown</mark>'s. His ongoing praise for Romneycare and condemnation of Obamacare is the conundrum of his unusual bid to unseat Democrat Shaheen and become the first person to represent two states in the Senate since 1879. Also on POLITICO: Massachusetts ditches RomneyCare health exchange) Opposition to President Barack Obama's health law worked for <mark>Brown</mark> - once. It propelled him from the backbenches of the Massachusetts State Senate to Washington in 2010. Less than three years later, he was voted out. It was arguably easier to attack the federal version of the law when Massachusetts already had a state-based program to cover its own people. It may be harder to finesse as <mark>Brown</mark> transplants himself to New Hampshire, where enrollment in Obamacare exceeded goals. More than 40,000 people signed up, including 31,000 with subsidies, and the GOP-led state Senate recently joined Democrats to expand Medicaid, covering more low-income people in the state by embracing a key piece of the federal health law. Shaheen, like many of the vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in November, has been reticent about Obamacare. But she said in an interview outside the Senate chamber this week that\" successes \"are emerging .\" I think people are beginning to see the changes the health care law has made, \"she said, while again pledging to keep addressing its flaws. CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare) There are, of course, plenty of voters in New Hampshire who oppose the president's health law fiercely, and <mark>Brown</mark> barreled into the state promising to be their champion. One health insurer dominates the exchange, he notes, and there's been a particular outcry here from people who can't see the doctor they are used to, or go to the nearest hospital without incurring extra costs. And there were those politically toxic canceled health plans. <mark>Brown</mark> hammers on those points on his tour, and he spends most of his stump speech slamming the law and the ills he says it has wrought on New Hampshire. He makes passing mentions of high energy costs and emphasizes his\" long and strong ties \"to New Hampshire. But he repeatedly returns to the harm of Obamacare - and he lays the blame in Shaheen's lap .\" She's the deciding vote on Obamacare, along with all the other Democrats that rammed it through Congress, \"<mark>Brown</mark> said on his tour stop .\" Since when does the federal government tell us what to do and how to do it? That's not what we believe in here, that's not what I believe in. \") Shaheen has been talking about small businesses, jobs and veterans more than the Affordable Care Act. Her campaign notes her support for the health law but emphasizes her efforts to\" improve \"it, a staple for embattled Democrats. Lately though, she's beginning to describe more bright spots, including robust enrollment numbers. She also said as many as five insurers are thinking about joining New Hampshire's exchange next year, undercutting <mark>Brown</mark>'s argument about a lack of competition. She also pounced on <mark>Brown</mark>'s role in passing Massachusetts's health care law, accusing him of having\" changed his mind \"on policies he supported as a state senator .\" I don't know where <mark>Scott Brown</mark>'s been, \"she said .\" There are fixes that we need to make but the answer is not to repeal the law. \"For his part, <mark>Brown</mark> says he's not conflicted about his health record .\" I have no challenge. I'm very clear. I know what I did. I know how I voted, \"he said in the interview .\" We addressed a situation in Massachusetts that everybody worked on together...That's not what the federal plan did. And we didn't raise taxes, and we didn't cut Medicare. \"Polls show Shaheen leading by a few points, but it's early and lots of voters are undecided. Americans for Prosperity recently announced a\" six-figure \"ad buy here, hammering Shaheen on Obamacare and helping <mark>Brown</mark>.
