(ap photo/michael dwyer) - red sox manager terry francona was upset with one of the umpires when he charged out of the dugout and had a beef with two of them by the time he returned. francona's outburst after tim wakefield was called for a balk in the second inning got him a quick trip to the clubhouse, where he watched his slumping club lose 9-2 to the minnesota twins. he could be looking at a suspension. \"i got thrown out because i came out. and since i was already thrown out i figured i could get an explanation,\" francona said. francona was ejected for storming out to argue the call, which he proceeded to do for several minutes after plate umpire <mark>angel hernandez</mark> tossed him. crew chief <mark>joe west</mark> kept francona away from <mark>hernandez</mark> and was bumped a few times while francona fumed about the decision, which cost the red sox a run and the third out of the inning. francona was more critical of <mark>west</mark> than <mark>hernandez</mark> after the game. \"that was me and <mark>angel</mark>. <mark>joe</mark> didn't have anything to do with it. i didn't really appreciate what he did,\" francona said. \"he was grabbing me. i didn't appreciate that. i thought it was wrong. i thought he was out of line .\" francona threw his gum to the infield turf, getting a boisterous cheer from the fenway park fans who didn't know they were in for another long night just a day after boston lost 11-0 to the los angeles angels. trevor plouffe homered in the first inning and <mark>scott baker</mark> pitched eight strong innings for the twins, who capitalized on several boston blunders. minnesota scored twice on balks and took advantage of a pair of errors by the red sox, who have allowed 21 runs in their last two games. <mark>baker</mark> (2-2) allowed seven hits, struck out eight and walked one for the twins, who have won three straight for just the second time this season. j.d. drew homered in the second and adrian gonzalez went deep in the fourth, but that was all the offense for boston, which has lost three straight. the homers and francona's furor were about the only highlights for the home fans. wakefield (0-1) allowed eight runs, six earned, and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings. \"i had a little trouble today,\" wakefield said. \"obviously i walked four guys and couldn't find the strike zone and when i did, one ball was hit out of the park and the other one was a double .\" minnesota got a little help from the red sox, who fell to 3-5 on an 11-game homestand. the twins scored three in the second after loading the bases with no outs. wakefield nearly got out of it by getting drew butera to fly out and striking out alexi casilla, but denard span got a grounder past first baseman gonzalez and two runs scored. ben revere, who reached on a single, then came in from third when wakefield was called for a balk while trying to pick off span. boston got span in a rundown and tagged him, but the out was waved off when <mark>hernandez</mark> made the balk call. francona was ejected moments after leaving the dugout. he continued to argue for several minutes after <mark>hernandez</mark> tossed him and his arms tangled a few times with <mark>west</mark>. gonzalez's long drive in the fourth struck one of the giant signs above the seats on the green monster and cut minnesota's lead to 4-2. but boston unraveled again defensively in the fifth. danny valencia doubled to left with the bases loaded, driving in two more runs for the twins. wakefield was replaced by alfredo aceves, who inherited runners on second and third. aceves struck out revere and got butera to hit a grounder to shortstop jed lowrie, who misplayed the ball. the error allowed two more runs and the twins led 8-2. the twins got another run in the sixth on two more mistakes by the red sox. plouffe, who reached on a fielder's choice, stole second and went to third when lowrie missed the throw from home. plouffe then scored when aceves was called for a balk before he could get off the next pitch. \"yeah, it was about as much of a balk as you're going to,\" francona said. \"i wanted to run back out and tell him he got it right .\" notes: <mark>baker</mark> struck out leadoff batter jacoby ellsbury on his first three pitches ....twins manager ron gardenhire said lhp francisco liriano's scheduled start monday will depend on how he feels saturday. liriano was sick friday and stayed at the team's hotel ....francona said before the game he might go to the heat-celtics playoff game after the twins and red sox play saturday afternoon -

cancer. ballesteros fainted in a madrid airport while waiting to board a flight to germany on oct. 6, 2008, and was subsequently diagnosed with the brain tumor. he underwent four separate operations, including a 6? - hour procedure to remove the tumor and reduce swelling around the brain. after leaving the hospital, his treatment continued with chemotherapy. ballesteros looked thin and pale while making several public appearances in 2009 after being given what he referred to as the \"mulligan of my life .\" he rarely was seen in public since march 2010, when he fell off a golf cart and hit his head on the ground. his few appearances or public statements were usually in connection with his seve ballesteros foundation to fight cancer. he wanted but was unable to take part in a champions exhibition at st. andrews in the british open. such was his stature, even out of the public eye, that european players celebrated his most recent birthday - the saturday of the masters - as if it was a national holiday. for such greatness, his career was relatively short because of back injuries. ballesteros won a record 50 times on the european tour, his first as a 19-year-old in the dutch open, his last when he was 38 at the 1995 peugeot open in his native spain. that also was his last year playing in the ryder cup, where he had a 20-12-5 record in eight appearances. he was captain in 1997 when europe won at valderrama. ballesteros was the reason the ryder cup was expanded in 1979 to include continental europe, and it finally beat the united states in 1985 to begin more than two decades of dominance. while others have played in more matches and won more points, no player better represents the spirit and desire of europe than ballesteros. he announced his retirement in a tearful press conference at carnoustie before the 2007 british open. ballesteros had returned to augusta national that year to play the masters one last time, but shot 86-80 to finish last. after turning 50, he tried one champions tour event, but again came in last. his back was ailing, his eyes were no longer as lively, and his best game had left him years earlier. \"i don't have the desire,\" ballesteros said. that desire was as big a part of his game as any shot he manufactured from the trees, the sand - just about anywhere. born april 9, 1957 in the tiny town of pedrena, spain, he learned golf with only one club - a 3-iron - that forced him to create shots most players could never imagine. ballesteros first gained major notoriety at 19 in the final round of the british open at royal birkdale, where he threaded a shot through the bunkers and onto the green at the 18th hole, finishing second to jack nicklaus. \"he invented shots around the green,\" nicklaus said in the weeks before ballesteros was inducted into the world golf hall of fame in 1999. \"you don't find many big hitters like him with that kind of imagination and touch around the green. he's been a big inspiration to golf in continental europe, more than anyone has .\" ballesteros went on to win the order of merit on the european tour that year, the first of six such titles. two years later, he won the first time he teed it up in america, a one-shot victory at the greater greensboro open. partly because of his humble roots, partly because of his spanish blood, ballesteros always played as though he had something to prove. even after some called him \"car park champion\" for his shot at lytham when he won the 1979 british open, the spaniard showed that was no fluke when he arrived at augusta national the next year. he obliterated the field in the 1980 masters, much like tiger woods did in 1997. applying his genius to a course built for imagination, ballesteros took a seven-shot lead into the final round and led by 10 at one point until he started spraying tee shots and won by four. even so, at 23 he was the youngest masters champion until woods won at age 21. ballesteros won the masters again in 1983, and he was equally dominant in golf's oldest championship. he won the british open in 1984 at st. andrews over <mark>tom watson</mark>, then won again at lytham in 1988 by closing with a 65 - the best score of the tournament - to beat nick faldo. his career was marked by nasty disputes with european tour officials and pga tour officials. he quit the european tour in 1981 in a disagreement over appearance money, the only year he missed the ryder cup. he became angry with pga tour commissioner deane beman in 1985 for not playing the required 15 events for membership. despite his five majors and 87 titles around the world, ballesteros forever will be linked to the ryder cup. he developed an \"us against them\" attitude that became infectious with what had been an inferior european team. he made his teammates believe. pga national, his ball beneath the lip of a bunker, some 245 yards from the green, when he lashed a 3-wood to the fringe and escape with a halve against fuzzy zoeller. the americans narrowly won, but the ryder cup was never the same after that year - and perhaps after that shot. \"his desire to beat the americans was paramount, and probably the reason they beat us,\" <mark>watson</mark> said. \"the ryder cup became the focus of world golf, and seve was right there as the leader .\" jose maria olazabal to become the most formidable partnership in ryder cup history, producing an 11-2-2 record. in his final ryder cup, at oak hill in 1995, he was playing a singles match against <mark>tom lehman</mark> when ballesteros drove wildly to the right. a tv commentator said his only two choices were to pitch back to the fairway or play a big hook around a massive tree. ballesteros studied his options, then hit over the green to the front of the green. such was the unpredictable nature of ballesteros. there have not been many like him, if any at all. \"seve is a genius, one of the few geniuses in the game,\" ben crenshaw once said. \"the thing is, seve is never in trouble. he's in the trees quite a lot, but that's not trouble for him. that's normal .\" ballesteros and wife carmen divorced in 2004. they had three children. the spaniard stayed active in golf after he stopped playing regularly, mainly through golf course design. thank you for joining our conversation on newsok.com. we encourage your discussion but ask that you stay within the bounds of our commenting and posting policy. please help by flagging comments that violate these guidelines. posts that contain obscene or vulgar language will be immediately flagged and not posted. hyatt? rewards program earn 10,000 gold passport points when you stay 5 nights. join today. class 3a girls state golf tournament photos from thursday's competition at the class 3a state golf tournament at dornick hills in ardmore. prep golf: 2011 class 3a girls state tournament okc thunder vs. memphis grizzlies playoff photos game 2: may 3, 2011 okc thunder vs. memphis grizzlies photos: view photos from the thunder's western conference semifinal second playoff game against the grizzlies inside the oklahoma city arena. the thunder defeated memphis 111-102 to even the series 101. okc thunder vs. memphis grizzlies: may 1, 2011 thunder practice: preparing to hit the road to memphis may 5 after evening things at one game a piece, kevin durant and his teammates know things will only get more difficult as the series shifts to memphis for the next two games. press row: the thunder's key vs. memphis", "articleID": "2011050708_00067965_W", "names": {"Tom Lehman": ["Q26922239", "Q949710"], "Tom Watson": ["Q263802", "Q532111", "Q7002019", "Q7818002"]}}, {"date": "2011-05-10", "url": "http://recordpub.com/news/article/5031906", "content": "more people showed up for a kent state university graduation ceremony than expected, forcing hundreds to watch saturday's commencement from remote locations. university officials said 73 graduates and 500 people in total could not fit in the memorial athletic and convocation center and instead were led to two buildings nearby to watch the keynote address on projectors. every graduate could still walk across the stage, ksu spokeswoman emily vincent said. this was the first time students couldn't fit in the building, officials said. \"i don't think there was one happy person in the room,\" said kayla wilson, an exercise physiology graduate and one of 400 people -

a cyclical sector - and invested in assets that were non-cyclical such as costcutter,\" he said. \"now we are going to the banks saying\" give us money to buy cheap assets' but they are very cautious on loan to value rates, offering 50 per cent instead of 80 per cent, for example. \"but this is the wrong way round. because assets are cheap the risk is lower - the banks should be lending more, not less. the logic on lending needs to be more disciplined through the cycles. we will see more foreign banks coming into the market unless our own lenders become more active .\" bibby said his financial services business, which accounts for a largest chunk of the? 1.2bn-turnover empire, grew 20 per cent last year with the bad debt profile \"the best it's been for 17 years\". he also revealed the company had explored the option of buying a bank to expand into the sector but walked away from the deal due to the level of capital required against any deposits. he warned corporates that lending margins would remain high due to the capital adequacy ratios now being enforced on banks and said they should plan for the worst and look to pay down debt in the face of an uncertain refinancing market. bibby added that a two-tier lending system - where many small companies were unable to meet the criteria of a good track record and a strong balance sheet - were not being helped by the centralisation of credit decision making in the banks. he called for a return to local decision making, giving relationship managers in the region more say in their ability to finance companies, and aid the process of assessing risk and lending more into the market. <mark>angela knight</mark>, chief executive of the british bankers' association said the industry had \"collectively stepped up to the table for change\" through a reformed culture, better management and the raising of extra capital. \"we have made these changes very publicly and very noisily,\" she said, before adding that there \"was more to come\". but she also told the audience \"we won't build the right future if we dwell on the past\" .", "articleID": "2011051208_00062097_W", "names": {"Angela Knight": ["Q4762477", "Q532835"]}}, {"date": "2011-05-12", "url": "http://dunstabletoday.co.uk/sport/football/local-football/penalty_wish_works_for_zed_1_2668977", "content": "thu may 12 09:04:49 bst 2011 a wish to the heavens came true for zdenek kroca on tuesday night when <mark>mark tyler</mark> pulled off a dramatic penalty save against wrexham to help propel the hatters into the blue square bet premier play-off final, writes <mark>mark wood</mark>. luton may have won the tie 5-1 on aggregate but tuesday night's game was anything but plain sailing. leading 3-0 from the first leg, town were behind after just eight minutes when andy mangan netted before winning a penalty 12 minutes later that could have turned the tie on its head. but <mark>tyler</mark> came to luton's rescue, denying <mark>gareth taylor</mark> from the spot, with kroca revealing: \"i just wished a bit of luck for us .\" in the fa trophy kevin pilkington saved the penalty but their player had a tap in from the rebound and i just wished a little bit of luck for us. \"<mark>tyler</mark> made a great save and after that moment we played well .\" the czech defender admitted luton had started poorly and <mark>tyler</mark>'s save was the turning point. he said: \"it's hard because we knew we were three goals up and they had nothing to lose and scored an early goal .\" the start of the game wasn't what we wanted. \"we were a little bit nervous and under pressure .\" then from the penalty they had a great chance to extend their lead. \"thanks to tyles who saved a penalty and kept us in the match .\" if they were two-up it would be much more difficult for us. \"kroca then weighed in with a 29th-minute equaliser on the night to all but kill off the red dragons. he said:\" i'm happy that i scored and helped the team to be a little bit more confident. \"i think the keeper made the wrong decision. he took a step forward and i just tried to hit the target and scored over him .\" we calmed down after this goal and it lifted our confidence -
