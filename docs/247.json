Subscribe to our daily newsletter Sign UpSarah Tysoe with her son George Tysoe, right, and aviation historian Jonny McNee The family of a British war pilot have visited the spot where a Spitfire aircraft crash-landed in a field in Ireland. Second World War pilot Lieutenant Gordon Hayter Proctor bailed out of the plane moments before it plummeted into the field in Co Monaghan. The Spitfire crashed because of massive engine failure during a flight across Northern Ireland on September 20 1942. The pilot's niece Sarah Tysoe travelled from England on Thursday after local archaeologists uncovered parts of the Spitfire last year which remained buried in the field since WWII. The aircraft's engine are among some of the parts exhibited at Monaghan County Museum. This summer, Monaghan County Museum hosts a fascinating new exhibition: The Monaghan Spitfire--Life on the Border with a World at War. Opening on 28th June 2018 and includes a real Spitfire and an anticraft gun outside Monaghan County Museum #MyMonaghan pic.twitter.com/eNNn31roqs <mark>Liam Bradley</mark>, the museum creator, and aviation historian Jonny McNee were instrumental in locating and recovering parts of the RAF Spitfire. Mr <mark>Bradley</mark> said: \"The Spitfire suffered massive engine failure and the pilot bailed out. Advertising\" As the engine is so front heavy it flew on for a few minutes but once it lost power it dipped down almost at an 80-degree angle at 400 miles an hour. \"Most of the plane disintegrated on impact but the engine was buried some three metres below the surface. The pilot parachuted out and landed a few miles across the border in Co Tyrone. Mr McNee said:\" The Spitfire crash is part of the local history. Advertising \"Everybody heard about it, lots of people went to the area and stole a bit of the plane before the Irish Army arrived. Sarah Tysoe views the crank shaft of the Spitfire plane (Brian Lawless/PA)\" Proctor was flying with a meteorological flight that were based at RAF Aldergrove (Belfast). He would go up and take the temperature, humidity and air pressure. \"He did that two or three times a day and feed information back to the base.\" The first thing he did when he landed was bury his parachute as he didn't know if he was in the North or South. \"The locals approached him, politely, with pitchforks. But they welcomed him and he had a bath and a meal and was able to ring his base.\" Some hours later he was back flying. He was an exceptional pilot. \"However, the pilot went missing in Burma in October 1944 and was never found. Ms Tysoe described the visit as\" surreal \".\" It's amazing to actually see the spot, it's indescribable, \"she said.

overhauling the $2.5 trillion healthcare system sparked what promises to be a long and bitter debate over president barack obama's top domestic priority. the senate will vote on saturday night on whether to move to debate on the legislation--the first key procedural hurdle for the senate plan and one that requires 60 votes from the 100-member body. \"the finish line is in sight,\" <mark>reid</mark> said. \"i'm confident we'll cross it soon.\" whether democrats succeed depends on <mark>reid</mark>'s ability to keep his party's caucus intact. there is no room for error--democrats control exactly 60 votes, and republicans so far are united in opposition. <mark>reid</mark> dodged questions about whether he had the votes to move forward, telling reporters, \"we'll find out.\" if the senate agrees to take up the bill, the debate would begin on november 30, after next week's us thanksgiving holiday. it would last at least three weeks, making it unlikely obama can sign a final bill by the end of the year. any differences between a senate bill and the house of representatives version passed on november 7 would have to be reconciled before a final bill can be voted on again in both houses and sent to obama to sign. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated <mark>reid</mark>'s bill would cost $849 billion over 10 years--below obama's $900 billion target--reduce the budget deficit by $130 billion in the same period and extend insurance coverage to 31 million more people. the rosy report card from budget analysts could ease doubts about the bill among wavering moderate democrats, but republicans were not impressed. \"we've been warning the american people of the democrats\" plans to raise premiums, raise taxes, and slash medicare in order to fund more government, \"republican leader mitch mcconnell said. cheaper than house the senate bill is less expensive than a more than $1 trillion healthcare measure passed in the house, which would have covered at least 5 million more uninsured. like the house bill, the senate measure would require all americans to buy insurance and would set up exchanges where they could choose among various options. it also would offer subsidies to help low-income workers pay for the coverage. the senate bill includes a government-run insurance option that lets states choose whether to participate, and would halt industry practices like denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. some business trade groups were unhappy about the proposal, including america's health insurance plans, which represents the insurance industry, and the national federation of independent business, which represents small businesses.\" the new healthcare taxes and fees will raise the cost of coverage for individuals, families, and employers, \"said karen ignagni, president of america's health insurance plans. healthcare investors were mostly unconcerned about the senate bill as most provisions were expected, but a surprise proposal for a 5% tax on cosmetic treatments hurt companies such as allergan inc and medicis pharmaceutical corp. republicans criticised tax increases in the bill to help pay for the expanded insurance coverage, including the new tax on elective cosmetic surgery they dubbed a\" botox tax. \"the bill would also raise the medicare payroll tax on high-income workers, which is used to finance the government health program for the elderly, and impose a tax on high-cost\" cadillac \"insurance plans. mcconnell noted some of the bill's deficit reduction was possible because many of its provisions would not kick in until 2014, a year later than in the house bill.\" that's a little bit like being asked to pay your mortgage four years before you \"re allowed to move into your house,\" he said. three democratic senators--<mark>ben nelson</mark>, blanche lincoln and mary landrieu--are uncommitted on saturday's vote, although <mark>nelson</mark> and landrieu said they were encouraged by <mark>reid</mark>'s approach. <mark>nelson</mark> played down the vote's significance. \"it's a simple vote--to go forward with debate or not to go forward with debate,\" he said.

halves dividend, new CEO says could raise capital LONDON A man walks past the head office of Standard Chartered bank in the City of London February 27, 2015. Reuters/Eddie Keogh/Files LONDON Standard Chartered (STAN. L) halved its dividend and said it would raise capital from investors if needed, as new chief Executive <mark>Bill Winters</mark> outlined his thoughts on reviving a bank hit by a 44 percent slump in first-half profit. Shares in the Asia-focused lender rose 4.5 percent to 994.9 pence on Wednesday as investors welcomed <mark>Winters</mark>' move to set a target to double return on equity to a minimum of 10 percent. That helped offset disappointment over the cut to the dividend for the first half of the year to 14.4 cents a share from 28.8 cents a year ago. The bank said it had \"rebased\" the payout to reflect its \"current earnings expectation and outlook\" . As a result of the cut, StanChart said its common tier 1 equity position, a key measure of capital strength, had risen 80 basis points to 11.5 percent, six months ahead of target. <mark>Winters</mark>, who became CEO in June, did not rule out raising capital in future. \"If we decide we need capital for the long-term benefit of the group, we will raise capital,\" he said. The bank said its pretax profit in the first six months of the year fell to $1.82 billion, down 44 percent from a year ago. StanChart has suffered a troubled three years, hurt by problems including fines from U.S. regulators for misconduct, strained relations with top shareholders, plunging commodities prices and a weakened trading environment. On his first day in charge, <mark>Winters</mark> told investors the bank needed to strengthen its finances and simplify operations to increase shareholder returns. The lender has struggled to shake off concerns it will need to raise additional capital to bolster its balance sheet, especially if Asian economies that have traditionally served as the biggest drivers for its revenue growth continue to falter. The lender is aiming for cost savings of $1.8 billion by the end of 2018. Some analysts have said <mark>Winters</mark> needs to raise at least $5 billion from a rights issue and a dividend cut to strengthen the balance sheet and generate cash to grow lending and kick-start revenue growth. <mark>Winters</mark> has already shaken up the bank's management structure, streamlining its eight geographical regions into four units that will report directly to him.

Tyson Fury proclaimed himself\" the greatest heavyweight of all time \"and is making a beeline for Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder in an effort to become top dog in the division once again. Fury established himself as the number one in boxing's blue riband weight class in November 2015 when he wrenched the WBA, IBF and WBO crowns from the long-reigning Wladimir Klitschko in a stunning upset. Well-publicised personal issues and an anti-doping case have kept Fury out of the ring since then but he resumes his professional career next Saturday against little-known Albanian Sefer Seferi at the Manchester Arena. The 29-year-old (25-0, 18KOs) remains the lineal heavyweight champion although Joshua has risen to prominence in his British rival's absence and holds his old belts while Wilder is the WBC titlist. Fury, though, is supremely confident in his own abilities to the extent that he believes there is no man alive who is able to defeat him, and that he can handle Joshua and Wilder with ease. He said:\" There's been plenty of come forward aggressors throwing big bombs, there's been plenty of boxers on the back foot, but when has there ever been a 6ft 9in switch-hitter with the confidence of <mark>Muhammad Ali</mark> and Floyd Mayweather rolled into one? \"There has never, ever, ever been anybody like me. I'm unbeaten, I'm fast, I'm brash, I'm young, I'm good looking, I can dance, I've even got white teeth. What more can I have as a fighter, as a boxer, as a sportsman, as a showman?\" I am the greatest heavyweight of all time, I'm not even going to be modest. I already beat the legendary Wladimir Klitschko and I did it easy, it was an easy fight. \"So put me in the ring with these bums and I'll tell you how to put them down: easy peasy lemon squeezy!\" I am the best that there's going to be and I don't believe there's a man born yet that can beat me. \"Nobody has seen what I can do yet because I've not had an opponent take me to that level that I need to go to. The better the opponent you put in front of me, the better I become.\" Seferi has spent the majority of his career at cruiserweight although he has only lost once in 24 contests in the paid ranks and never before been stopped. Ahead of his highly-anticipated comeback, Fury insists he feels better than ever following his lengthy lay-off. He said: \"You're going to see the best Tyson Fury there's ever been. I know a lot of people talk a good game when they've been (inactive for a long period), they always say they've done everything correctly.\" But when I say I've never, ever, ever been better or stronger or fitter or faster, I mean it. I've sparred hundreds and hundreds of rounds in the gym, I'm doing very, very well. \"Fury intends to box up to four more times in 2018 and thinks he could be challenging for world honours before the year is out. He added:\" It's 100 per cent possible this year. Don't rule it out that I don't take over the world this year and win a world title back. \"0 Read and react"}, {"articleID": "2015042623_00001739_W", "names": {"Jim Prentice": ["Q19877246", "Q364303"]}, "date": "2015-04-24", "url": "http://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2015/04/24/premier-jim-prentice-says-alberta-is-not-an-ndp-province/", "content": "Alberta NDP leader Notley says <mark>Prentice</mark>, Wildrose leader aren't that...Alberta premier tips hat to NDP Leader Rachel Notley's debating...NDP: Paramedics asked to pay out of pocket for medical equipment NDP: Broad consensus emerging from debate: NDP's Rachel Notley shines Alberta Party: Gordon Dirks conveniently forgets his role in overpriced...Wildrose: Jean presents clear vision for low taxes and balanced budget in...CALGARY - Premier <mark>Jim Prentice</mark> is dismissing the possibility of the political left surging to power in the May 5 election, saying Alberta is \"not an NDP province.\" The Progressive Conservative leader had his guns firmly trained on NDP Leader Rachel Notley on Friday, one day after a televised leaders debate that many political pundits say she won. <mark>Prentice</mark> said he likes Notley and considers her a \"skilled\" debater, but there are questions about how her party could afford its election promises. \"This is not an NDP province,\" <mark>Prentice</mark> said after touring a Calgary bakery. \"I don't believe that the voters of Alberta want to see an NDP coalition or an NDP government. I think they take pride in our province as the economic engine of this country.\" The election was supposed to be a coronation for <mark>Prentice</mark> when he called it a year earlier than required, with the opposition parties in disarray. But opinion polls have suggested there is a tight three-way race among the Tories, the NDP and the Opposition Wildrose under leader Brian Jean, and some of the most recent surveys put the NDP in front. The Tories have been in power in Alberta since 1971. The NDP has never held more than 16 seats. The debate tussle between <mark>Prentice</mark> and Notley reached a climax in an exchange over corporate taxes, with <mark>Prentice</mark> mocking Notley with the quip \"I know math is difficult.\" The hashtag \"#mathishard\" instantly became popular on Twitter, with many users labelling the remark as patriarchal and even sexist. <mark>Prentice</mark> said he wasn't trying to be mean-spirited and was referring to a math error by the NDP earlier in the campaign. \"I did not mean any disrespect to Rachel Notley and I'm sure she knows that.\" Asked if she considered <mark>Prentice</mark>'s comments sexist or condescending, Notley said: \"Not at all.\" Doug Griffiths, a former PC cabinet minister who isn't running in this election, said the math comment is a disappointing distraction. \"If <mark>Jim</mark> had turned and said that to Brian Jean, I don't think anyone would have said anything,\" Griffiths said. \"But he said it to Rachel and it sounded patronizing and belittling...I know <mark>Jim</mark> and I don't think he intended it that way at all.\" Griffiths said there was no doubt that Notley \"did exceptionally well.\" \"<mark>Jim</mark> really needed to tie and I think he was a very close second.\" Duane Bratt, political scientist at Mount Royal University, said the math comment shows <mark>Prentice</mark> is on the razor's edge as far as his image goes. \"It ties into the reputation that <mark>Prentice</mark> has of this arrogant elitist mansplaining to Rachel how arithmetic works.\" While Notley and <mark>Prentice</mark> duked it out, the premier often turned his back to Jean. <mark>Prentice</mark> shrugged off suggestions he was dismissive, citing his frustration with how specific Jean was being about proposed Wildrose spending cuts. Jean said he had no concerns with it. \"I'm not going to comment on the professionalism of other people in that particular debate,\" he told reporters at an event in Edmonton. \"I'll let people decide for themselves if they see what took place if that's the person they want for their premier, then that's the person they want for their premier.\" Notley urged Albertans Friday not to look to the Wildrose as an alternative to the Tories. She said the two parties have plenty of things in common and the Wildrose is quickly becoming a non-factor. 504 - 7th Street South Lethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7 (403) 328-4536 Print Advertising: (403) 328-4410 National Advertising: (403) 380-7585 Online Advertising: (403) 380-7585"}, {"articleID": "2014020501_00037762_W", "names": {"Alex Jones": ["Q16235485", "Q19559933", "Q20666729", "Q26330355", "Q2641401", "Q319121", "Q47113851", "Q4717247", "Q4717250", "Q4717251", "Q4717252", "Q4717253", "Q4717255", "Q50365540", "Q5665987"], "James O'Keefe": ["Q6140497", "Q6140500"]}, "date": "2014-02-04", "url": "http://www.prisonplanet.com/soros-corporate-group-predicts-terrorism-at-winter-olympics.html", "content": "Internationalist group believes threat may not come from Muslim North Caucasus region February 4, 2014 The International Crisis Group (IGC) is predicting a terrorist attack in Sochi during the Winter Olympics.
