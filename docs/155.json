over as head golf professional at richmond pines country club on june 2, stands on the tee box at canyon gates country club in las vegas. naveen reddy has traveled internationally teaching golf to many different types of people, and he has brought his expertise to richmond county. reddy has been the head golf professional coach at richmond pines country club since june 2. before coming to richmond pines, reddy was teaching golf in las vegas for a year-and-a-half. \"i was the director of instruction for my own golf academy, where i taught golf to mainly physicians at different hospitals,\" reddy said. las vegas is just one of the many stops on reddy's trek across the world to provide his golfing knowledge and instruction. he has traveled to over 50 countries teaching golf, given more than 30,000 golf lessons and performed in over 300 golf shows. in addition, reddy was the head golf pro on several cruise ships including those owned by carnival cruise lines, celebrity cruise lines, holland america cruises and p & o cruises. \"i've been really blessed to be doing what i'm passionate about,\" reddy said. \"most people that are club pros, you aren't just the teacher of golf, you are like the general manager. but i have always enjoyed teaching because that was the fun part. doing the paper work and working on the computer wasn't that cool. i feel my experience in teaching is second to none because i have given so many lessons .\" benny bowles, owner of several golf courses in the state, took over the lease at richmond pines and persuaded reddy to leave the bright lights of las vegas behind to become the head golf pro at richmond pines. according to reddy, bowles gave him his first big break when he hired reddy as the head pro at woodbridge golf club in kings mountain from 2002 to 2004. \"he told me that i got a course in rockingham that no one is teaching golf, and if you don't teach golf, then there aren't going to be any new golfers,\" reddy said. \"he told me i need your skills and to come down here and teach the community how to play golf. that is what will drive new customers, and he really wants me to make golf exciting .\" the people that play golf are already playing it. he wanted to bring a fresh face, a new angle and for me to get the word out about golf to richmond county. \"reddy has started the process by scheduling four junior golf clinics this summer, as well as, men's and women's golf clinics .\" i'm doing all these clinics for the kids and for older people because that's something that hasn't been done around here, \"reddy said .\" what i'm trying to do is reach out to the community and get everyone involved. i want to bring everyone back to the country club. \"reddy added there are changes being made to the golf course including restoring the greens and remodeling the clubhouse .\" at one time, richmond pines was a thriving country club, was the hottest spot in the whole county and the membership was at 400, \"he said .\" throughout the years, it has gotten neglected, not had that much excitement and the membership is down to 120. i want to revive the country club by bringing excitement back and i've

battle\" the single biggest threat to facebook's business model might be the stroke of a federal bureaucrat's pen. so, with its roadshow underway and hopes for a giant ipo on may 18, the social media giant has been sending friend requests all over washington. the prime objective? keep the government from imposing stricter privacy laws that could restrict how facebook collects information about users-and what it does with all that data. \"there's nothing cute about [facebook's] lobbying operation,\" writes politico's michelle quinn. \"its d.c. shop has been built for battle .\" so, what would your strategy be if you had an almost unlimited budget, an insane valuation, and a wildly popular but controversial product? here are the five keys to how facebook hopes to keep the government off its back: 1. recruit heavy hitters. facebook's team members were well-known in political circles long before they joined the social network's lobbying network. joel kaplan, was a member of president george w. bush's staff. the point person in its dealings with the u.s. house of representatives was an aide to speaker of the house john boehner. erskine bowles, a former white house chief of staff under president clinton, and <mark>don graham</mark>, the chairman of the washington post, are on its board of directors. and its chief operating officer, cheryl sandberg, was chief of staff to the secretary of the treasury under clinton. of course, facebook isn't alone in playing the known-name game. in february, politico, facebook is the first pre-ipo tech company to have its own political action committee. moreover, its key people have spread the wealth, so to speak, by donating to the campaigns of president obama, likely gop nominee mitt romney, and congressman ron paul. 3. become indispensable. the same people facebook lobbies in washington are often among its users. it's virtually impossible to imagine running a political campaign now without making facebook a central part of your online strategy. \"it has hosted congressional leaders and their aides at its washington office and its menlo park, calif., headquarters,\" quinn reported. \"it hosted so-called young guns from house gop leadership as well as president barack obama, and streamed the events live on its site .\" 4. get in front of key issues...when the ftc insisted on a 20-year oversight deal to settle charges that facebook had engaged in \"unfair and deceptive\" practices last year, ceo mark zuckerberg trumpeted the consent decree as \"a framework for how companies should approach privacy,\" and evidence of \"a clear and formal long-term commitment\" to privacy. that's typical of how the company works, representative mary bono mack, a republican from california, told politico. \"they are responsive, engaged, and big thinkers when it comes to internet policy .\" 5 ....but let others be the lightning rods. get on the same page show and tell by sharing your screen instantly at join.me.
