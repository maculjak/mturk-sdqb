$130.7 million for stormwater management and $27.3 million for solid waste, according to data obtained by the ajc. the solid waste division was merged on paper but was never truly consolidated with the water system, according to the water system's former director, robert brice. and though the departments were purportedly merged, county documents consistently refer to the $27.3 million for solid waste as \"loans\" from the water system. cobb paid back part of that \"debt\" with the water system's own money, then sidestepped bond restrictions by absolving itself of paying back nearly $18 million of the $27 million loan. bond experts say most of the county's actions ran afoul of bond restrictions that were agreed to by the county. \"i find it disturbing what seems to have transpired,\" said emory university finance professor j.b. kurish, a municipal bonds expert. \"it kind of astounds me, quite honestly.\" most of the questionable activity occurred from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, while <mark>bill byrne</mark> headed the county commission and during current county manager david hankerson's tenure. reached for comment by phone, <mark>byrne</mark> denied any wrongdoing. hankerson declined an interview request. brice, who headed cobb's water system from 1994 to 2007, said the funding moves were inappropriate. water and sewer customers were expecting to pay only for their water and the treatment of used water - \"not for purposes other than the customers that we served,\" brice said. bond terms look violated what cobb could do with the water system's money was constrained by the fact that it had issued bonds earlier. when cobb did that, it had to make promises to investors in the bonds. municipal bonds are issued by governments to borrow large amounts for a specific reason. when revenue bonds are issued, the municipality agrees to a legal contract called the bond resolution. that's a written set of stipulations on how the government will handle its finances and repay those who invest in the bonds. the bond resolution is the investors' \"collateral,\" said georgia state university professor bart hildreth, a municipal bond expert. three municipal bond experts who reviewed cobb's bond resolutions at the ajc's request, including kurish and hildreth, said consolidating the solid waste and stormwater management divisions deviated from the water system's bond restrictions. their reasoning: the bond documents narrowly define cobb's water system as including only water and sewer services - not solid waste and stormwater. and the water system's money couldn't be spent on expenses not related to the system. there is another issue: solid waste was never actually consolidated into the water system, brice said. \"on paper, it appeared that solid waste was a part of the water system,\" brice said. but, the two departments did not commingle their finances or staff and continued to operate out of different buildings. the only connection between the two departments, brice said, was the water system \"loans\" to solid waste that occurred between 1998 and 2003. two of the bond experts said the loans ran counter to what was allowed in the bond restrictions. the bond documents state that the water system's money is \"supposed to be dedicated toward the [water] system,\" kurish said. hildreth said he did not think that a loan would violate the bond restrictions as long as it was paid back. what did deviate from the restrictions, he said, was the county commission's decision in april 2009 to absolve itself of paying back the majority of the loan debt. it's difficult to say whether cobb's financial decisions will come back to haunt the county. most of the bonds that were outstanding at the time have since been paid off, so the county is in no real danger of defaulting on them, experts say. but the three main bond rating agencies - whose ratings determine how much interest cobb pays when it borrows money - could look into the issues and lower the water system's aaa rating, experts say. that could increase the county's interest rate and thereby the cost of borrowing to the water system, though the experts said it would be difficult to say how much. the three agencies that rate municipal bonds - moody's, standard & poor's and fitch - either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries for this story. \"one of the things that rating agencies consider in their ratings is not simply the financial flows, but they also engage in an evaluation of the quality of management,\" kurish said. \"and it would seem to me that there has been in the past - in the very least - some questions about proper disclosure and proper management of finances in cobb county.\" \"borrowing from yourself' when the loans began, the solid waste division was sinking. it needed money to pay for the closing of several landfills and operating the compost facility, which had cost the county tens of millions of dollars, county documents show. chairman <mark>byrne</mark> told brice the county needed to\" solve the problem \"of solid waste's finances, according to brice. hankerson and virgil moon, finance director at the time, later approached brice to work out the details, brice said. moon, now the director of cobb's support services agency, declined an interview request. brice said <mark>byrne</mark> assured him that the loans would be paid back with 5 percent interest. but by the time <mark>byrne</mark> left office in 2002, none of the money had been returned. the loans continued until 2003 when <mark>byrne</mark>'s successor as chairman, sam olens, says he stopped the practice.\" i was aghast at what had occurred, \"olens said. cobb did not put the terms of the loan in writing, nor did it have a repayment plan, brice said. the ajc requested both from cobb, which produced nothing. olens said that until he took over as chairman there was never any intent to pay back the debt. <mark>byrne</mark>, asked whether the loan was going to be paid back, did not answer directly.\" you're borrowing money from yourself, \"<mark>byrne</mark> said.\" where would the money come from to pay back the water system? \"in 2005, the loan money started getting paid back. but cobb made the repayments with the water system's own money. county policy allowed it to transfer a certain percentage of water system money to the county's general fund each year. so, beginning in 2005, after that money was moved to the general fund, the county began returning some of it to the water system. cobb paid back $9.4 million of the debt, without interest, before writing off the remaining $17.9 million last year. olens says that two of the three bond rating agencies told cobb to write off the loans.\" the credit rating agencies went up to me and said, \"why are you doing that? wipe it off. just don't do it again,'\" olens said. asked why he supported writing off the loan debt, now-chairman <mark>lee</mark> said: \"because that was what was recommended to me by staff.\" the use of water system money for other purposes has taken a toll on the water system - and its customers. \"any time you have anticipated income that you don't get, you have to make it up somewhere else,\" brice said. \"we made it up through rate [increases].\" in the mid-1990s, the water system had planned to be out of debt by 2008 and pay for major projects with its surplus money, brice said. larry and kathy turner have turned their riverfront property into a place to call home. drew brees has joined an eclectic group of past winners for sports illustrated's top award. santa claus strikes a pose as he reveals his north pole fashion secrets. we congratulate these atlantans for losing more than a 100 pounds each on their weight loss journeys. the newest panda cub is a month old and zoo atlanta staff are pleased with its development. christmas tree takes special meaning for pipeline explosion survivors teen accused in stomping of girl sues for right to education in jail after tires flattened by pursuing police, driver remained in car and drank beer"}, {"articleID": "2009020712_00095555_W", "names": {"Anthony Adams": ["Q16105262", "Q4771968", "Q4771970", "Q4772792", "Q52733230"], "Ron Smith": ["Q15429434", "Q16151519", "Q16214918", "Q20640642", "Q20732311", "Q21598352", "Q28455021", "Q30069157", "Q3441453", "Q7364400", "Q7364401", "Q7364402", "Q7364403", "Q7364404", "Q7364405", "Q7364406", "Q7364407", "Q7364409"]}, "date": "2009-02-07", "url": "http://sanjosestate.scout.com/a.z?s=199&p=2&c=822577", "content": "dt tommie harris (jonathan daniel/getty) special to bearreport.com posted dec 18, 2008 the chicago bears were supposed to have one of the best defenses in the nfl, which is why several defenders received big-money contract extensions. however, that doesn't look to be money well spent, as the d is having another forgettable year. get the inside slant from the nfl experts at scout.com. assuming the bears don't make the playoffs, and it's almost a lock that they won't, they have a much bigger problem on the horizon than their absence in the postseason. first things first. here's how the bears can be eliminated from the playoff picture before monday night's 7:30 kickoff at soldier field in their 176th regular-season meeting with the packers: it would take victories by the vikings, who are 3.5-point favorites at home over the falcons on sunday; the cowboys, who are 4-point favorites at home saturday night against the ravens; the bucs, who are 4-point favorites at home against the chargers; and the eagles, who are 3.5-point favorites on the road against the redskins. in that scenario, the vikings would clinch the nfc north at 10-5, since the worst they could do is finish with the same 10-6 record as the bears, who would lose in a tiebreaker. the cowboys and bucs would also move to 10-5, meaning they could do no worse than finish with the same record as the bears, who would also lose to dallas and tampa bay in tiebreakers. but the situation that must be addressed as soon as this season ends is the state of the defense, which, despite all the money that's been lavished on it, is getting worse instead of better. the bears defense is currently 17th in total yards allowed, tied for 15th in points allowed, 28th in passing yards allowed and 25th in sack percentage - not the numbers of an up-and-coming group. in the same categories last season, the bears finished 28th, 16th, 27th and sixth. back in 2006, when the bears went to super bowl xli, they were no. 5 in total yards allowed, no. 3 in points allowed, no. 11 in passing yards allowed, and no. 16 in sacks - with almost all of the same players. but they're not getting better. they're just getting older. most of the starters on defense have already gotten much wealthier, but they obviously haven't been more productive and in many cases their performance is sliding. brian urlacher had 185 tackles in 2006, 158 in 2007 and is on pace for 114 this year. he had five interceptions and five sacks last season. he's got two picks and no sacks this season. tommie harris had 48 tackles in' 06, 43 in '07 and is on pace for 30 this season. if he has chronic knee problems at 25, his future doesn't look very bright. oh, by the way, <mark>anthony adams</mark> has played in just seven games this season and started only twice, but he has the same number of tackles (26) as harris, who has started 11 games and played in 12. doug pensinger/getty images does anyone think cornerbacks charles tillman are getting better? vasher's performance and his health have deteriorated so badly that no one would be surprised if he were cut before next season. vasher had eight interceptions in his pro bowl year of 2005, when he was known as \"the interceptor.\" the next season he had three picks, and in the past two seasons, he's had a total of two as he missed 12 games in '07 with a groin injury and eight games this season with hand injuries. he ended both seasons on injured reserve. what was a youthful, promising and improving defense two years ago has turned into an aging, underachieving and declining group in need of a facelift. and that's supposed to be the strength of this team. danieal manning returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown against the saints, he became the first bear to do so since <mark>ron smith</mark> went 94 yards for a td on dec. 17, 1972 at oakland. manning leads the nfl with a 29.5-yard kickoff-return average, although he didn't become the bears' primary kick returner until five games ago. \"we're winning, that's the most important thing,\" manning said. \"when i go out there, my goal is to give the offense good field position. other than that, touchdowns and everything after that are just bonuses. hopefully i can get more bonuses.\" ...sometimes it seems the rivalry with the packers is more important to the fans than the players, but defensive end adewale ogunleye said he hates the packers, too. \"the fans won't like you if you don't, so i hate the packers,\" ogunleye said. \"i want all the bears fans to know i hate the packers. it's a big rivalry, and after losing the way we did up there (37-3), it makes it even more of a heated battle. i can't wait. i really, really want to try to settle the score and at least go 1-1 against the packers.\" ...as one of the bigger success stories to come out of the arena football league, wide receiver rashied davis was disappointed to hear the league will suspend operations for the coming season after 22 years in business."}, {"articleID": "2010071515_00151360_W", "names": {"Mel Gibson": ["Q3854066", "Q42229"], "John Porter": ["Q21933529", "Q26898988", "Q3181414", "Q3182331", "Q55395742", "Q57438483", "Q6054159", "Q6253196", "Q6253204"], "Viggo Mortensen": ["Q12343940", "Q171363"], "Bill Maher": ["Q17183175", "Q25189369", "Q2903288", "Q489", "Q56529291"], "Michael Moore": ["Q10430120", "Q174908", "Q1752903", "Q1928646", "Q20054072", "Q21166729", "Q333446", "Q40220120", "Q47468073", "Q59154912", "Q5992831", "Q6832887", "Q6832890", "Q6832891", "Q6832892"], "Michael Moriarty": ["Q22279295", "Q30121954", "Q531869", "Q6832909"], "Margaret Somerville": ["Q3846888", "Q43393573", "Q962122"], "David Warren": ["Q10264453", "Q21453181", "Q22252736", "Q39944482", "Q42887525", "Q4476202", "Q5240847", "Q540582"]}, "date": "2010-06-03", "url": "http://steynian.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/steynite-412nd/", "content": "there has been a terrible development in the case of rifqa bary. according to rifqa, \"any way you look at it, the crunch is coming. i do not have the illusion it will be painless, for the nanny state is utterly unprepared for, and was anyway ill-equipped to handle, popular rebellion.\" commies + jihadis = kill the jews! death to israel! are off-kilter when it comes to stuff we like, people we hate, and \"news\" . nonetheless, this elf smells boatloads of bs in the coverage of the gaza fauxtilla. when it comes to the paleostinian talent for staging news-events -

except it's canada. just imagine. . if only blazing catfur had been on the streets of gaza, where he could receive the proper jihad-style smiting, maybe even a crucifixion, where free speech and diversity don't get in the way of straight-forward attitude adjustment on infidels. \"keep it peaceful?\" then again, it would seem that the thumbsuckers of the toronto pd tricycle division are well on their way to bringing that dystopian diversistan into existence, where the rules run only one way, and where assault means a conservative infidel possibly resisting the assault on him by one of the bully-classes. ali mallah? you or your parents were welcomed here to partake of our peace and civil society that canada (part of western christian civilization). actions like yours give the impression of immense ungratefulness, anti-western and anti-canadian and anti-freedom attitudes. you can take the barbarian out of barberia, as they say...as for canada being infiltrated by hate? mallah is pro-terror, a former vp of the ontario ndp, and a honcho in the bolshie cupe union. oh, and catfur? you may be a hobbit, but you got more cojones than a busload of malicious mallahs and their hizbie & hamas bullies. i wish i were in toronto with you, to stand beside you. trudeau, successive liberal regimes expose canada to chinese, russian spies ~ item: chinese intelligence activity in other countries: \"former chinese spies have reported that china has more than 1000 spies in canada, more than in any other country outside china. the canadian government fears that the chinese have stolen considerable business and industrial secrets from the country\" commies on the brain here at binks-hq. . i've been reading on mao, che, alger hiss, whittaker chambers, the venona spy intercepts, and spy works in canada. what occurs to me is that the jihad infiltration of the west can fruitfully be thought of as cold war 2.0 - people of an anti-western faith, committed unto death, misusing and reshaping language to hide and redefine their activities of infiltration, subversion, and influence. from the 1930s onwards, soviet agents infiltrated western governments, either to steal information, place sleeper agents, or agents of influence to change the policy of western governments towards soviet goals, or against the best interests of the west. only some of those agents were ever caught or self-revealed in canada, the united states, or england in the spy scandals of the 1940s to 80s. alger hiss, kim philby, igor gouzenko, and many other names haunt our history. the jihad - violent, subversive, and otherwise - is much with us, and has infiltrated parliament, universities, and major canadian cities. we have canadian money funding terrorism, and terror-plots in canada. we have sharia-zones with polygamy (on the government dime), child-brides for sale, and where radical mosques teach the death of canadian society and the victory of muhammed and his religion over the world. in the soviet infiltration, most canadians didn't pay attention - aside from igor gouzenko in 1945, or the brief spy-frenzy which followed. we never had a proper reckoning like the u.s hiss-chambers case, or the rosenburg trials (yes, they were both guilty). the left is still after those scary neo-nazis. . no such bugaboo as a neo-commie. now, most people are looking the other way at jihad, aided and abetted by the cowardly or politically correct media, and our puzzled and compromised elites. no more coddling of the radicals, or government hand-outs, or treating suspect muslims as quaint multicultural artifact. the nice muslims were the people who came here before the 80s. their kids and grandkids and the new immigrants cannot be assumed to love canada as she is, but only as she will be when raped, burka-ed, and made to submit to muhammed. as for communism, china is still spying our pants off. of kilts & bagpipes. not sure about haggises, but there ye go, aye? so let's not go go on and on about turbans, kaffiyehs, kirpans, niqabs, yarmulkes, and all the multi-culti / religious permitted dress in western societies. the attempted banning of the kilt is clearly a strike at scots, and manly men (of whatever hue). manly men wear kilts. sexy chicks wear kilt-like dresses. scots history is an indispensable part of the development of responsible government versus the absolutism of kings - or, we might say in this age, the absolutism of petty bureaucrats and powerful busy-bodies. a instakilt-towel, but teh binks-dad has the full modern-style gear. i'd love to buy something similar one day, or a great-kilt (think liam neeson in rob roy, not <mark>mel gibson</mark> in those kilt-ette hollywood silly things he invented for braveheart. . aside from the fact that wallace was a lowland knight = chainmail, not kilts). heck, i even like hands off the kilt, and don't touch my sporran! the worst part? one of the kilt-banners - the jackson missouri high school principal - is one mr. rick mcclard. the alberta school superintendent (westwinds school district) doug bennet compared kilt-wearing to students sporting flip-flops or short-shorts to school. duhr. why not (politely) let raymond high principal mark beazer, principal [mark.beazer @ westwind.ab.ca] and superintendent doug bennet [doug.bennett @ westwind.ab.ca] know what you think? maybe next time someone should argue that authentic \"traditional scottish garb\" includes a targe (shield), dirk (wicked long-knife), sgain dubh (boot-knife), and \"vast sums of money, corporations and dc politicians form one immense incestuous mass of goo that laps the banks of the potomac and poisons the body politic. rich people never have to take responsibility-in this life.\" ~ sad to say it, but there's barrels of blame to go around for everybody on the bp oil disaster in the gulf of mexico. obama? lotsa oil-money donations to his crooked campaign. . and there's always that award he handed out. his non-handling of the situation? the oil company? not planning for the inevitable fail? epic fail! democrats? created no-go oil zones cover the u.s. offshore, so that (a) china has more drilling rights off cuba and mexico that the u.s. does, and (b) oil companies are drilling bigger and deeper and more potentially disastrously to exploit the areas they are allowed to drill in. oh, and all that jet-setting to copenhagen and hawaii and all? rep. <mark>john porter</mark> (r-nevada): \"speaker pelosi's private jet costs $50,000 to fly from san fransisco to dc and burns 11,000 gallons of jet fuel. the rest of us are suffering from higher cost of living and lower quality of life.\" never mind gore's mega-mansion, giant jets, and all those smug twits in coal or oil-powered electric cars (at one remove, of course) feeling smug about their toxic-battery enviro-horrible cars. repubs? oh, the kick-backs, look the other way, the intimate entanglement of the political class with the corporate class, and all the rest. bush kissing that saudi guy and walking hand in hand - yeah, we get it. enviroids? see democrats above, plus their desire to cripple and punish oil companies as evil incarnate. safe and easy to fix alternative sites not a mile underwater? gosh, no. enviroid-fail like ddt, global warming, and so many other environmental idiocies, the consequences of the enviro-theories mean death, pollution, and worse in the real-world. they proclaim themselves the righteous crusaders, yet are as dirty and compromised as everybody else - and all to often, steam along on the government dime. so: we have a world-class hard-to-fix environmental mess because of. . well, everybody, especially the ones point fingers at everybody else. obama has failed - yet again - a real-world crisis; the democrats and enviros made the rules that made such an incident almost inevitable, no matter how careful the drillers and amazing the technology. solution? stop banning drilling in alaska, the offshore, and in the tens of thousands of other places better and easier to clean up than a mile underwater in the gulf of mexico. plus, build new refinery & storage capacity for the u.s. now. stop using the piping furbish fuchsia plover mugwort as an excuse to forbid legitimate development; stop hating the u.s. as the greatest engine of progress and change and generosity the world has ever known; stop raping the environment indeed - have reasonable safeguards and all that, but not the current insane situation invented by the democrats, benefitted from by all, and preached over by the enviroids. the side-benefit will be that american sovereignty will be protected, and the islamic world domination project known as saudi wahabbism will no longer be funded by the target-nation. oil independence has been talked about for years, but is not in the interests of the america-last crowd, nor the up with islam bunch (including obama) currently running dc and america. imagine iran threatens nuking the persian gulf oilfields - there's the end of the world as we know it. time to do something about it before we're left wondering why we didn't do something about it while there was still time. ~ one area in which some muslims seem a bit embarrassed is the marriage of 6-year old aisha to 56-year old muhammed. of course, he heroically didn't sex her up vaginally until she was 9-years old. gotcha. here's a thought experiment. the 56 year-old prophetess aisha marries a 6-year old boy, but doesn't make him have sex with her until he's 9. yup, it's eww-factor 10! horny granny has the hots for a grade 1 kid, but restrains herself until the lad's in grade 4. that is: if muhammed violates natural justice (and the common practice of mankind) by advocating paedophilia against girls, why should we believe him on any other topic? what other \"great religious leader\" of the past ever taught the same? after all (again, simply following the nearly-universal custom of humanity and natural justice), if male-female sexual union is (first) for the procreation of children, then for pleasure and couple-bonding - that has little to do with poor young exploited aisha. a child of her time, aisha probably did not sexually mature until 12-13 years old, and thus could neither get pregnant, nor experience meaningful sexual pleasure (or vaginal lubrication) via an old man. this is the figure who inspires a billion people, and the perhaps 300 + million of jihadi / sharia supremacists as \"the perfect man' who is a model for all muslim believers. hence the child-brides and bought and sold women and polygamy of some muslims: it's all from muhammed's own bad example. aside from aisha, muslim history indicates that muhammed had over 66 different women and wives and concubines, like any ancient potentate or modern cult leader. all because\" allah told me so \". really? a horndog blaming god for his lusts is really a bit rich. imagine if christianity taught that joseph married a 6-year old mary, or that jesus had sex with that 12-year old he raised from death, instead of healing her and giving her back the fullness of life which was only then beginning to flower in her, and unfold over the next 5-8 years - grown-up faith, adulthood, family and children and husband, according to her wishes and those of her family, and god's will and purpose for her. that's the pattern of adam and eve, of both male and female being made in the image of god, and in christ, being truly free and equal:\" and a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife \", says jesus,\" and the two shall become one flesh. \"- that's a christian doctrine based on the inherent equality and dignity of man and woman - that's not what muhammed lived and told others was the way to act. a six-year old or nine-year old maybe many things, but a wife is not one of them. when we throw away christian anthropology, we have the polymorphic couplings of sexologists, or various\" customs \"or\" breaking of taboos \"- i.e. the time-tested, god-given foundations of western society in the family. the divorce & contraception culture has touched and changed us all, and done more damage to individuals and families and societies than we can even recognize. sorry to beat on this drum, but since islam is the leading religious threat to the west (with liberalized christianity in second place), it bears pondering, according to the light of reason and revelation. it's not a forbidden topic, because god is truth, and in him is no darkness - we don't have to perform verbal or faith-based acrobatics to justify the creepy behaviour of muhammed, because he was a sinner like all the rest of us, however much he said that\" god told him to \". ~ these days, our dreams and wonderings may be seen in movies. the post-apocalyptic side of our soul has had two interesting contributions recently: the road (starring <mark>viggo mortensen</mark>), and the book of eli (the denzel). what is it about that question of the end of the world, surviving, and the collapse of all we know and trust which is so compelling? do these dreams foreshadow the future, or remember the impoverished ages of the past, or the hints of the end seen in a century of war and death camps and famines? both? the truth is, of course, that our western technological comforts and certainties are a house of straw. disaster, war, terrorism, an asteroid, a few nukes is all that it would take to knock us back several hundred years. there's a greedy-for-doom side of the enviropocalypse crowd, as if they would call down doom on us for our enviro-sins. the spiritual impulse in man is innate to us, however it may get bent, misplaced, or wrong-headed. visions of flooding, super-storms, scenes to rival the depictions of end things in the bible seem to almost delight a certain kind of mind - making the greenpeacers much of a kin with end-times evangelicals. a mere 73 000 years ago, the indonesia toba super-volcanic eruption did kill off all but the toughest and luckiest humans, by hiding the sun and killing off a lot of animals and plants. some scientists guess that a mere 5 000 of our african ancestors survived the big smokey, to repopulate the earth to the point we're at today. life is fragile, fleeting, and although westerners are blessed with the richest, safest, healthiest civilization in the history of ever, to take that for granted - or to forget that others already live on this same planet with us in sometimes semi-apocalyptic circumstances - is to forget our mere luck, and our massive opportunities and responsibilities. in any case, death comes to most of us give or take a century - we all have to live well and die well, and ponder whether this world is it, or the beginning of a greater life. <mark>viggo mortensen</mark> is one of the great actors of our time, propelled to stardom by his portrayal of the king-to-be aragorn in the gruelling trilogy of the lord of the rings. while the road isn't mad max exciting, it's an intimate tale of a father and son wandering in the burnt aftermath of world-wide disaster, seeking to stay alive and stay human.\" from rushdie to van gogh to the motoons, law enforcement has guarded the thugs and harrassed those who draw attention to the thuggery. this is pc policing: there are identity groups who merit the solicitude of the constabulary, and there are the rest of you who don't. \"kathy shaidle -

According to reports, the proposals are a mix of the two previous suggestions - both of which were rejected by Cabinet sub-committees tasked with investigating them. The so-called facilitated customs arrangement will use tech to keep the Irish border open but will still leave the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of Europe, it has been claimed. Downing Street is said to be confident the new plan - designed to free the UK to strike its own trade deals while still exchanging goods with the EU - offers the\" best of both worlds \"and has business support. But Mr <mark>Davis</mark> told Mrs <mark>May</mark> in his letter that Brussels would not countenance a plan that would allow the UK to police the EU border, according to the Daily Telegraph. A source told the paper:\" This plan would be like <mark>Donald Trump</mark> allowing us to keep an eye on his borders for him, it will never happen. \"We need to have this row in the party now so that we have time to negotiate something bespoke with heads of state before it's too late\" . The source added: \"It provides unfair advantage to British companies.\" Meanwhile, the Sun reports that Mr <mark>Davis</mark> fears the customs plan would be too great a softening of the Government's Brexit red lines and wants to harden the Prime Minister's stance. \"It's a choice about strategy. Do you be extremely reasonable and adjust, or do you face down the EU?\" a pro-Brexit figure told the paper. \"They will come to us eventually, we just need to hold our nerve.\" FACILITATED CUSTOMS PLAN The facilitated customs arrangement would see the UK collecting the correct level of tariff at the border regardless of whether goods are bound for the UK or the EU - a marked difference from the previous plan. Technology would allow the Government to determine in advance where 96% of the goods are headed - while tariffs on the remaining 4% of goods will have to be rejigged later, as per the old plan. A Number 10 source told the Times: \"This is a serious proposal that addresses the legitimate concerns of the EU as well as the new for the UK to be able to sign free trade deals.\" It takes the best bits of both models and ensures a friction-free border in Northern Ireland while at the same time allowing businesses to benefit. \"\"REALLY FOOLISH' But eurosceptic MPs have already raised concerns about the plan - in particular suggestions it could involve keeping the UK in a single market on goods.

Another messy morning in winter-weary Northeast Another messy, snowy morning in winter-weary Northeast; many in South still waiting for power Health plans don't cover weight loss surgery 1 percent of eligible patients get weight loss surgery; majority of health plans don't cover Huge thermal plant opens as solar industry grows World's largest thermal solar power plant rises in Mojave Desert, but it comes with a cost Christensen leads US sweep in slopestyle skiing Clean sweep for Team USA as Joss Christensen leads US trifecta in men's slopestyle skiing Associated Press WILLISTON, S.C. (AP) - Ben Ziegler frowned grimly as he used borrowed equipment to cut firewood for his home on the third day without power to keep his family of five warm, including his 14-month-old daughter. \"I got tired of this about five minutes after the lights went out,\" the 33-year-old U.S. Army veteran said at a firewood stand near his Evans, Ga., neighborhood. Despite their weariness, Ziegler and thousands of others in east Georgia and western and southern South Carolina may be without power for several more days. The nasty winter storm that blew through the South and eventually barreled up the East Coast dumped a tree-splitting, utility-pole-snapping inch of ice on the area and many, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, compared the damage to the aftermath of a hurricane. \"I didn't know this was going to be in the same realm as Hugo,\" Haley, who toured damaged areas Friday, said of the hurricane that struck in 1989. \"To look at these neighborhoods and see the trees down and on houses - to see all of the devastation that's happened to this community - is terrible.\" The same system dumped more than a foot or two of snow on parts of several states and was blamed for more than two dozen deaths, closed schools, snarled air traffic, caused countless crashed and delayed thousands of flower deliveries on Valentine's Day. The longest-lasting effect, however, was power. About 1.2 million utility customers from the South to Northeast lost power at some point during from the South through the Northeast. That dramatically dropped to about 465,000 outages by Friday morning, mostly in South Carolina and Georgia. The numbers did keep dropping, but life without electricity after a third day was becoming a hassle. With roads finally thawed out, many in the hardest hit areas were able to finally leave their homes. But there weren't too many places to go. Few stores were open because they didn't have power either. Dollar General stores across the region let people shop by flashlight, but were only taking cash because they had no way of scanning credit cards. Intersections became risky games of chicken because traffic lights were out and deputies were elsewhere trying to help clear trees and limbs off roads and checking on older people and the sick. Losing power in a rural area often means losing water, too. Many residents are on wells with pumps that need electricity to operate. Some people had buckets out to catch the melting ice so they could use the water to flush their toilets. Tedda and Stan Howard were ready to wait a long time to get their power back from Aiken Electric Cooperative. During the day, they cut down broken branches and repaired fences so their goats wouldn't escape from their 56 acres near Williston. At night, they huddle around the propane heater and played chess by candlelight. They had a neighbor who had power and offered them a warm shower. \"That ought to be enough. Hopefully they'll have it back on by the weekend,\" Tedda Howard said. That seemed doubtful. Power lines were sagging to the ground or snapped in more than a dozen places on the two-lane highway by their home. One coastal South Carolina electric cooperative lost 50 poles in the ice storm, compared to 21 in the last hurricane, officials said. \"With a hurricane, the storm blows through, does its damage and it's gone. An ice storm is like a hurricane followed by a series of mini-hurricanes. You restore power to an area, but then the ice comes back and the same area goes down again,\" said Bob Paulling, CEO of Mid-Carolina Electric Cooperative in Lexington. Rural areas were hit the hardest and their geography means it will be much more difficult to get power restored, said <mark>Mark Quinn</mark>, spokesman for the South Carolina co-ops. In urban areas, one fix of a power line often turns electric back on for thousands of customers. \"Not only do you have less customers per line, but the terrain is also much tougher,\" <mark>Quinn</mark> said. \"We're exposed more than any other utility.\" But for most folks, being without power was more of an annoyance. People told about learning that their tablet computer wouldn't recharge with their car charger or were upset their DVR was missing recording their favorite shows. Ziegler says he lives in the South in part so he doesn't have to deal with winter weather that has been particularly harsh this season all over the country. Two storms in two weeks have been too much. The frown returned when he was told the Farmer's Almanac predicted one final Southern winter storm for the end of the month. \"One storm was too much,\" Ziegler said. \"I'm ready to wear my shorts again.\" ___ Associated Press writers Seanna Adcox in Aiken, S.C., Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Meg Kinnard in Columbia contributed to this report.

(the lake is more than 30 metres deep in places .) then matt fairbrass stepped in. president of lost airmen in muskoka project, a group dedicated to finding missing aircraft, fairbrass and his friends learned some years ago that a family of trappers living beside the lake had actually seen the crash and the two planes plunging into the water. backed by eyewitness accounts and military maps of the crash site, the group started searching. \"i spent hours, hundreds of hours, looking for it,\" says fairbrass, who used side-scan sonar. \"it's like a golf ball in middle of a football field. blink and you miss it.\" fairbrass and his friends, al bacon and don ruud, narrowed the potential sites down to three then called in the opp. the provincial police underwater search and recovery unit found the plane last fall. \"it was so good to see that the plane had been located,\" said fairbrass. \"these men made a sacrifice...this is the least we can do for them.\" it's not yet clear if any remains of the two pilots have been recovered. <mark>campbell</mark>, from west sussex in england, came to canada in 1940 as part of the successful empire air training scheme to train pilots from the commonwealth countries and other allies for the conflict."}, {"articleID": "2016122113_00099951_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2016-12-21", "url": "http://canadafreepress.com/article/its-climate-regulations-that-threaten-us", "content": "Our nation is not threatened by manmade climate change. It is threatened by regulations implemented in the name of protecting us from dangerous manmade climate and weather It's climate regulations that threaten us Comments | Print Friendly | Subscribe | Email Us In President-Elect <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s Contract with the American Voter, a \"100-day action plan to Make America Great Again,\" Mr. <mark>Trump</mark> outlines several measures he says he will undertake to create jobs and spur economic growth. While much of his proposed agenda will help to improve the economy while also leaving reasonable environmental protections in place, I believe there are two additional environment-related policy changes that he could take to jump-start the economy. In a September 21, 2015, appearance on Hugh Hewitt's radio show, Mr. <mark>Trump</mark> said, \"I'm not a believer in man-made global warming. I mean, Obama thinks it's the number-one problem in the world today. I think it's very low on the list ....We have much bigger problems.\" If these comments accurately reflect <mark>Trump</mark>'s views, a first important step he could take to undo the damage done by the Obama administration's vainglorious attempt to control climate and weather would be to reverse the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) determination that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a pollutant endangering public and environmental health. This \"endangerment finding\" came about in response to EPA following a narrow 5-4 Supreme Court decision in the 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA. In that case, a majority of the justices ruled that, if EPA determines carbon-dioxide emissions are causing global warming--and global warming may reasonably be expected to endanger public health or welfare--then EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant. In fact, the justices ruled, EPA would be required to regulate carbon dioxide under such a finding, unless it can provide a reasonable basis for not choosing to regulate this vitally important, plant-fertilizing gas. Relying on unsubstantiated projections produced by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, EPA did determine that CO2 emissions from cars and industry do threaten human welfare. That led directly to the agency's decision to limit those emissions. For instance, the endangerment finding was the basis for ratcheting up automobile fuel-economy standards to 54.5 mpg by 2025. That could soon mean consumers no longer have the right or ability to choose the vehicles they drive--based on safety, passenger or cargo considerations, for example--by either forcing all but the smallest cars off the roads or, at the very least, making larger cars and trucks too expensive for all but the relatively wealthy to drive. Additionally, the endangerment finding serves as the foundation for various Obama administration regulations requiring utilities, oil and gas producers, and other entities to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. If these draconian rules are not overturned by the <mark>Trump</mark> Administration, Americans will pay much more for energy and their energy supplies will be less reliable. Mr. <mark>Trump</mark> cannot undo the endangerment finding with the stroke of a pen. To reverse it, he must instead charge EPA to demonstrate, through independent, validated research, that carbon-dioxide emissions are \"toxic\" (which they are not at any levels that might occur in Earth's atmosphere)--or that global warming is causing measurable amounts of sea-level rise, increased hurricane numbers or intensity, the spread of diseases, or other harms directly attributable to carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States.
