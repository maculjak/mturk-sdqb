swedish cyborgs who use incredibly advanced technology to \"assimilate\" others into their collective so as to make themselves more perfect. they move from planet to planet, incorporating the inhabitants and their technology into the <mark>borg</mark> collective and stripping planets of all resources. although repeated assertions have been made that they bear an uncanny resemblance to microsoft, any such comparison is angrily rejected by the <mark>borg</mark>. incorporation into the <mark>borg</mark> turns a person into a robotic being, a rigid, soulless automaton devoid of character, individuality, or emotion, rather like keanu reeves or hillary clinton. despite being so advanced, whenever the <mark>borg</mark> walk they stagger around in a stiff and clumsy fashion, like al gore after six beers. in their spare time, the <mark>borg</mark> run a taxi service for the emperor of morley to get a bit of pin money. origins of the <mark>borg</mark> \"your resistance just makes us harder .\" ~ the <mark>borg</mark> on being perverted the <mark>borg</mark> were created when a bdsm club catering exclusively to leatherclad homosexual men entered a spatiotemporal rift presumably caused by a fisting paradox and was jettisoned into a protoplasmic soup of inanimate nanotech on the far side of the galaxy. this mysterious primordial ocean of liquid nanotech then came to life devouring the intruders. but the gay psyche was too strong and came to dominate the nanotech, upon which the <mark>borg</mark> arose out of the protoplasma with only one goal: assimilate! borgification \"in soviet russia, you assimilate <mark>borg</mark>!\" ~ luc-picard on borgification <mark>borg</mark> nanoprobes in action. the process of being assimilated is called borgification. the <mark>borg</mark> remove useless parts of the organic being (such as that little thingy that hangs down in the back of your throat) and the body is upgraded with the installation of cybernetic components, for instance, microchips, fiber optics, lithium power cells, lasers, lots and lots of wires and cables and hoses, inkjet printers, servo motors, toasters, and a robotic little thingy to hang down the back of your throat. during the process the individual is forced to watch \"barney and friends meets teletubbies\" on a windows computer for three days straight to break down any remaining traces of soul or consciousness. the resulting borgified human is a soulless drone without any individuality, a mere cog in a vast, unfeeling machine of destruction. on the plus side, you now have the ability to store up to 200 hours of music on your built-in 30 gb hard drive. there is talk of a huge 1tb hard drive for some <mark>borg</mark>, but these are unlikely to be implemented soon, as google have used up most of the universe's available disk space. species of the collective every time you exploit that joke, the <mark>borg</mark> assimilates a kitten! thousands of species from millions of worlds contribute to the <mark>borg</mark> collective, including humans, romulans, cardassians, sporks and vulcans. however, not all <mark>borg</mark> member species are humanoid. among the non-humanoid <mark>borg</mark> are the cute little kitten pictured here. <mark>borg</mark> vessels may also include borgified pets such as goldfish, parrots and turtles, or livestock such as cows and llamas. after all, there's no particular reason the species you assimilate has to be intelligent if you're just going to subsume it into a hive-mind anyway. the lack of prehensile appendages can quickly be fixed by attaching a spare human arm or two. however, the problem with assimilating too many species without opposable thumbs is that unless you've got a lot of extra human appendages laying around, the collective quickly ends up short-handed. after the destruction of the <mark>borg</mark> queen's vessel, the <mark>borg</mark> where forced to influence alies, like the ottoman empire in the 19th century. enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> consist of pretty much anybody who isn't <mark>borg</mark>. in no particular order: the federation. the <mark>borg</mark> launched an attack on earth to assimilate its population. they were only stopped when skynet and dr. who's cybermen launched copyright-infringement lawsuits against them. the klingons. the <mark>borg</mark> have decided to simply exterminate the klingons rather than assimilate them, because it's really a pain in the ass to get metal components to stick onto those funky foreheads. the fjord. the fjord are a race which split off from the main <mark>borg</mark> collective thousands of years ago. they are exactly the same as the <mark>borg</mark>, except they speak with a norwegian accent. to this day, the fjord and the <mark>borg</mark> remain bitter enemies, forever divided over the issue of whether or not to speak with a norwegian accent. the fjord also smell vaguely of smoked salmon, which is another reason the <mark>borg</mark> don't like them. rust kittens. the war between the <mark>borg</mark> and the planet of cute little defenseless kittens lasted about 23 seconds, after which the kittens accepted the unconditional surrender of the <mark>borg</mark> and told them to get off their planet. \"that piece of metal no-one cut off'. the piece of metal hath claimed many a <mark>borg</mark> life. their senses dont pick it up as an active threat, anyone who meets it dies before they can tell the others, and its alway catching the excess tubing coming out of their heads. species 8472. for no reason at all, those guys can anal the <mark>borg</mark> in less than half a second. rabbids can't be assimilated into the <mark>borg</mark>. but. they. can. dance! computer viruses, which make the <mark>borg</mark> freeze, reboot, delete files and play nsfw movies at inappropriate times. the kazon. of only one reason; the <mark>borg</mark> wants to be perfect, and the kazon are so stupid that even one assimillated kazon would ruin all the work they've done for eternity, plus drones need to be bald, and its a known fact that kazon hair is indestructible. why else do you think the kazon have the shittiest hairdos in the galaxy? cybermen. they are angry that the <mark>borg</mark> stole their shtick. technically they cant be angry, but you get the picture. jehovah's witnesses. they just won't leave the borgs alone. fighting the <mark>borg</mark> sophia is coming for you. after the destruction of the <mark>borg</mark> queen's vessel, the <mark>borg</mark> where forced to influence alies, like the ottoman empire in the 19th century. the <mark>borg</mark> are virtually unstoppable killing machines. however, here are a few tips to help survive a <mark>borg</mark> attack. get the all invincible crew of voyager to kill them for you. if you can, run, although the <mark>borg</mark> ships are capable of moving at incredible speeds. install a sexually transmitted computer virus into data and make him rape the <mark>borg</mark>. use photon torpedoes. and quantum torpedoes. and transphasic torpedoes. and chroniton torpedoes. use your phasers, rapidly shifting frequencies to stay ahead of the <mark>borg</mark>'s ability to shift their shields. the <mark>borg</mark> can rapidly adapt to your phaser fire. use unconventional means of attack such as spreading nasty rumors behind their backs to all their friends. wait...they don't have any friends. never mind. shoot them with holographic bullets from your holographic tommy gun point and laugh at their ugly face. if the <mark>borg</mark> nevertheless invade your ship, try to fit in. if the <mark>borg</mark> think you're already one of them, you won't be assimilated. dance\" the robot \". try covering yourself with aluminum foil. pull some tubing from their heads. hit them with a blunt object. they won't expect it. shine a laser pointer at their scanners. throw worf at them. ridges facing front of course. make kirk do them. put your finger on their chest, say\" you've got something on your shirt \", and when they look down, hit and run. correct their pronunciation of the word\" futile \". magnets. lots and lots of magnets. make them go to sleep. the common cold. get them to see an optical illusion. interpreting the pointless seems efficient against borgs. see philosophy. break off an extended part of their mechanical body. masturbate assimilate them. rickroll them. since they are notoriously slow-moving, just walk away. cover your eyes. the <mark>borg</mark> are notorious for thinking if you can't see them, they can't see you. just download vista into their hard drive. history the <mark>borg</mark> tried other methods of assimilation, but then the writers all wen on strike. violence was more fun anyway. <mark>borg</mark> started their career performing in low-class sundsvall pubs in exchange for beer. sideshow's real parents died in 1982 and for some reason bequeathed sideshow with a music studio in nearby france. the band then decided on a name (<mark>borg</mark>) and cut their first demo tape. the instruments were shoddily played, and the music was crap. <mark>borg</mark> sent their demo tape to all the major, minor, and produced-out-of-basement labels. somehow, their demo tape landed in the hands of <mark>kevin smith</mark>, a visionary filmmaker whose first project was 1984's footloose, an epic story of love and heartbreak in the caribbean starring ross gellar. <mark>kevin</mark> was intrigued by the raw, emotionless music and decided to include <mark>borg</mark> on the movie's soundtrack. following the release of footloose, <mark>borg</mark> skyrocketed to popularity and got their first top-40 hit with\" i wannabe assimilated \". the following year, <mark>borg</mark> produced their first album, the inimitable first contact. the tone and style of their new album was much more mainstream and accessible. the album soon went triple diamond. following the release of the album, in 1985,\" resistance is futile (give me all your love) \"hit #1 and stayed there for all 52 weeks. america, europe, and the world was in love with <mark>borg</mark>. unbeknownst to <mark>borg</mark>, an alien of blood curdling terror was watching them from its imperial starcruiser of force. the alien chose to infest the minds of <mark>borg</mark> and turn their bodies into evil, morphing, visceriods. the visceroids then mega-morphed into the current <mark>borg</mark> with the help of <mark>john kerry</mark>, the ent. the <mark>borg</mark> is currently planting mind seeds into usa's high council. the <mark>borg</mark> has been seen on vacation sailing its 38 ft schooner on lake

jacket four local educators - including a two-time baltimore mayoral candidate - are listed among endorsers of a black empowerment handbook that federal authorities say was written and distributed by the leader of a violent prison gang to spread its message. the most prominent is andrey l. bundley, who garnered 33 percent of the votes in a 2003 mayoral primary, ran again in 2007 and now oversees alternative education for the baltimore school system. he is quoted on the book's back cover as giving \"kudos\" to <mark>eric brown</mark>, an alleged leader of the black guerrilla family and the book's author. bundley wrote that <mark>brown</mark> \"availed his leadership capacity in jamaa [the organization] to guide his comrades towards truth, justice, freedom and equality .\" the black book - empowering black families and communities is self-published by <mark>brown</mark>. it outlines principles to bring about a revolution in the black community and, according to court documents, is being distributed throughout the state. an online order form offers a discount for inmates. bundley said he met <mark>brown</mark>, a 40-year-old from baltimore incarcerated since 1992 on drug charges, while doing gang outreach work in the state's prison system. he said he was impressed with <mark>brown</mark>'s work helping soon-to-be-released felons of various gang affiliations with self-improvement as they prepared for life in the outside world. those lessons were eventually compiled in the black book, bundley said, and his quotes apply only to the self-improvement work he witnessed personally. he said he was in no way condoning the violence with which the gang has been associated. school officials questioned bundley this week after learning of his quotes in the book. bundley's own book is cited in the black book among works by such notable figures as marcus garvey, according to a copy obtained by the baltimore sun. . \"i've seen [rival gangs] come together in one room and work on the lessons in the black book to get themselves together,\" bundley told the baltimore sun. \"i know <mark>eric brown</mark> was a major player inside the prison doing that work. the quote on the back of the book is only about the work that i witnessed: no more, no less .\" michael sarbanes, a city school system spokesman, said there is no evidence that the book has been used in the public schools. a copy of the book was obtained by the baltimore sun. \"the discussion or distribution of the book is in no way affiliated with city schools,\" he said. \"dr. bundley's job is making disengaged youth meet with success, and the book is not part of that important work .\" federal prosecutors say <mark>brown</mark> was actively working to expand the black guerrilla family's reach outside prison. he was one of 24 people indicted last month in federal court on drug and weapons charges, accused of running a violent criminal enterprise that involved murder, extortion, armed robbery and drug trafficking. drug enforcement administration spokesman edward marcinko said investigators have no evidence to indicate that bundley or any of the other educators are involved with the gang's criminal activities. confidential informants told authorities that the book - written by <mark>brown</mark> under the pen name \"la eusi jamaa,\" swahili for \"the black family\" - is a ploy to make the gang appear to be a legitimate organization. in addition to bundley, educators quoted on the book jacket include bridget alston-smith, whose nonprofit partners in progress works with at-risk children at three city schools. partners in progress hired a key bgf member and convicted murderer, rainbow <mark>lee williams</mark>, to help de-escalate gang conflicts at an alternative school. like bundley, alston-smith said her quote in the book reflected only the self-improvement efforts she witnessed while doing outreach in prisons. \"it was so enlightening to see them grow,\" she said, noting that the messages of the black book appealed even to white inmates. \"i thought it was a great curriculum,\" she said. \"now i'm hearing gang manifesto. i'm like,\" what?' \"two professors from anne arundel community college, tyrone powers and leslie parker blyther, are also quoted endorsing the book, though neither could be reached for comment friday to confirm the authenticity of the remarks. fbi counterterrorism agent and maryland state trooper, directs the school's homeland security and criminal justice institute. he also hosts a weekly radio show on 1010 wolb am where he is sharply critical of baltimore's leadership and promotes black empowerment. documents show he and alston-smith as president and treasurer of a corporation called children first movement inc. powers and bundley were classmates at southwestern high school and have advocated for inner-city children. an introduction to the book says its purpose is to\" make people aware of the vision of comrade <mark>george jackson</mark>, \"who founded bgf in 1966. <mark>brown</mark> writes emphatically that the group is an\" organization that has become a movement \"and not a gang. gangs are a\" backdrop to the chaos that we face in our neighborhoods ....the gang mentality has destroyed so much and given so little to our people. \"the book details financial empowerment, such as homeownership, managing

history crept closer for the ottumwa boys track team. the sun set on des moines roosevelt's 10-year run. metro magic! bulldog claim conference crown the sun set on des moines roosevelt's 10-year run. it was a feel-good evening for all bulldog track fans on monday night. ottumwa claimed its first ciml metro crown ever for longtime head coach jim nickerson at the conference meet held in ottumwa. the bulldogs' scintillating performance covered eight first-place finishes and a new meet record in the 4x400. ottumwa's historic win snapped des moines roosevelt's 10-meet metro win streak of first-place finishes in the overall team standings. the celebration started with a water shower that left nickerson's shirt drenched. the good times continued with one final victory lap around the oval by bulldog tracksters. \"i may stay wet all night. they can dump water on me anytime if they win,\" said nickerson. \"i don't know what to say. i'm so proud of these guys. it's a dream come true - ciml metro title .\" nickerson has been head coach at ottumwa since 1989 - 21 seasons - and first competed in the metro conference meet in 1999. the bulldogs took part in the southeast 7 league meet prior to that date. \"we're just glad that we can finally gave nickerson that conference championship. he's been waiting for this a lot longer than we've been alive,\" said ottumwa senior clint utter. ottumwa took first place with 146 team points. des moines roosevelt was a surprise second with 128. utter and fellow senior <mark>alex kelly</mark> are two of the best runners in ohs history and a fierce tandem that boast some of the state's best times. utter nipped <mark>kelly</mark> in a heated photo finish at the tape in the 200 dash for first place. utter clocked out at 21.97, <mark>kelly</mark> at 22.05. \"we didn't really care who won, we just wanted to get the points,\" said <mark>kelly</mark>. <mark>kelly</mark> tied a metro meet record with a 6-6 first-place leap in the high jump. he won the 400 dash in 49.04 and anchored ottumwa's first-place 4x400 relay. ottumwa shattered the old metro mark by almost four seconds with a stunning run of 3:22.46. ottumwa holds the second-quickest time in state in its marquee event. ottumwa held the old league meet's best time with a 3:26.36 in 2007. that's when three fourths of the ready-to-roll relay were just sophomores. \"state title\" has been

news player profiles retired leg-spinner stuart macgill thinks australia should play to their strengths by using four pacemen and a spinning all-rounder in the upcoming ashes cricket series in england. \"i feel really, really bad for suggesting this but i have always been a loud advocate for picking your best bowlers,\" macgill, a long-time understudy to shane warne as australia's top spin bowling option, told the australian associated press on tuesday. \"the bowling side have to get 20 wickets, full stop .\" macgill said marcus north should be selected at number six to add depth to the batting and bowling, with his part-time orthodox spin supporting the quicks. he said australia's pace bowling depth had rarely been better and needed to be given a chance to work as a unit, a departure from the usual tendency to play a specialist spin bowler in most conditions. \"our bowling stocks in terms of quicks, seamers and swing bowlers at the moment are possibly depth-wise the best of all time,\" said macgill, who took 208 wickets in 44 tests. \"i can't think of another time when we had that depth and that variety available to us .\" that being the case i think it is really fortunate for australia that we have north because what he allows us to do is to maybe play another four bowlers on top of him. \"north made his test debut in australia's recent two-one series win in south africa, when he scored a century and took two wickets in two tests. macgill said north should retain his place as a genuine all-rounder for the ashes opener at cardiff, giving selectors the space to include fast bowlers brett lee, <mark>stuart clark</mark>, <mark>mitchell johnson</mark> and peter siddle in the starting xi. if selectors wanted to stick with a recognised spinner, macgill said nathan hauritz had an edge over bryce mcgain. australia has struggled to find a long-term spin bowling replacement since warne retired as the leading wicket-taker in test cricket after helping reclaim the ashes in 2007 and macgill succumbed to injuries and quit the international arena in 2008. australia will announce their ashes squad next week. the top-ranked australians were upset two-one
