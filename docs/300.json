"content": "by joseph szczesny, journal register news service the general motors corp. assembly plant in orion township appears to have won the contest to build a new small car, beating out gm plants in wisconsin and tennessee. a person briefed on the decision told the associated press that the announcement the car will be built at a retooled midsize car factory in orion will come today. gm officials insisted a final decision hasn't been made. \"we have to notify our employees first,\" said gm spokeswoman katie mcbride. u.s. rep. <mark>mike rogers</mark>, a republican whose district includes portions of northern oakland county, called the report of orion's selection \"a credit to michigan's workers and management.\" their record of quality and accomplishment won them this opportunity, \"<mark>rogers</mark> said.\" it is the job of all of us in elected office, especially michigan's congressional delegation, to make sure that there are more opportunities to bring jobs to michigan. \"oakland county executive l. brooks patterson was waiting for the formal announcement by gm.\" i told them if it was good news to call me at 9 a.m. if it was bad news never to speak to me again, \"patterson said. the decision will protect 1,200 jobs at the factory, which otherwise would have shut for good. it's also expected to help protect jobs at the gm metal fabricating plant on the north side of pontiac. gm officials indicated they were concerned about the political backlash in tennessee and wisconsin from the decision.\" other communications need to occur before we can say anything about this issue, \"said another gm official. a consultant familiar with the competition between the three states said officials from wisconsin had offered $70 million in tax credits. it appears michigan's offer was larger and\" that might tip the scales, \"the consultant said in a private e-mail to the oakland press in pontiac. gov. jennifer granholm has not released details of michigan's offer, pending gm's announcement, but local officials were very optimistic. meanwhile, the governor's office has scheduled a separate press conference in birmingham to announce that general electric corp. now plans to build a new technology center in michigan aimed at developing clean energy. the center, which is likely to be located in southeast michigan, could bring as many as 1,200 new jobs to the state.\" there is still a very positive feeling in the air, \"said orion township supervisor matthew gibb, after a meeting thursday with representatives from the michigan economic development corp. gibb said orion had offered a 100 percent tax abatement over the next 25 years to secure the small car project. orion township agreed to expand and extend the rebate after gm pointed out that wisconsin offered a 100 percent tax abatement.\" we had to consider what the others were offering, \"gibb said. the orion project also is expected to bring new work to gm's metal fabricating plant in pontiac, which is also threatened with permanent shutdown. cash-strapped pontiac also offered gm a 100 percent tax credit for the metal fabricating plant. gm ceo fritz henderson said last week the chosen plant would be re-equipped not only to build a new small subcompact gm was planning to import from china but another vehicle as well, starting in late 2011 or early 2012. the new plant will not only build a small subcompact car, but also will be equipped to build other models, he said. the fact gm spent $600 million re-tooling the spring hill plant just last year was thought to have given the spring hill plant something of an edge in the competition. if tennessee loses the competition, the state's political establishment is certain to argue that the state is being punished for opposing gm's original request for government aid back in december. the janesville plant in wisconsin is nearly 100 years old and henderson had expressly ruled out building any kind of new plant. orion has its own energy source from a nearby landfill and reputation for building quality vehicles, having scored well on a j.d. power initial quality survey released earlier this week, gm insiders noted. meanwhile, gm has confirmed plans to close its assembly and stamping plants in shreveport, la., no later than june 2012. the announcement follows gm's disclosure that gm is shifting production of the gmc sierra hybrid pickup truck from canada to a factory in mexico rather than in the u.s. the silao, mexico, plant will take over assembly of the truck from the oshawa, ontario, facility that closed last month, according to gm. the shreveport plant might close even sooner depending on market demand for gm vehicles, according to shocked uaw officials. gm also is moving ahead with another round of buyouts and offers of early retirements among its salaried employees in the united states. new plans call for the elimination of about 4,000 additional salaried jobs by oct. 1. some involuntary cuts could be required if gm doesn't get enough volunteers to accept the buyouts, said gm spokesman <mark>tom wilkinson</mark>. gm had 29,650 jobs at the start of 2009 and in february gm said it planned to reduce the number of salaried employees to 26,000. the new buyouts are intended to trim the total to 23,500. gm plans to trim the number of executive positions by about 35 percent this year, to about 850, <mark>wilkinson</mark> said. the following are comments from the readers. in no way do they represent the view of macombdaily.com. we encourage your feedback and dialog and

"Syria Former Isis hostage says airstrikes on Syria are a trap French journalist Nicolas H\u00e9nin, who was held by Mohammed Emwazi, begs international community not to bomb Islamic State Wednesday 2 December 2015 11.36 ESTLast modified on Wednesday 2 December 2015 12.42 ESTShare on WhatsApp A French journalist held hostage by Islamic State for 10 months, has made an impassioned plea against bombing Syria, saying it was a trap that would only benefit Isis. Nicolas H\u00e9nin, previously held hostage by Mohammed Emwazi, implored the international community to seek a political solution. Engaging with Syrians, not bombing them, was the surest way to bring about the collapse of Isis, he said. In a five-minute video said to have been recorded in the past few days in Paris and posted on YouTube by the Syria Campaign, H\u00e9nin said: \"Strikes on Isis are a trap. The winner of this war will not be the parties that have the newest, most expensive, most sophisticated weaponry, but the party that manages to have the people on its side.\" In his message, apparently timed to coincide with Wednesday's UK parliament debate on joining Syria airstrikes, he said: \"At the moment, with the bombings, we are more likely pushing the people into the hands of Isis. What we have to do, and this is really key, we have to engage the local people.\" As soon as the people have hope in the political solution, then Islamic State will just collapse. It will have no ground any more. It will collapse. \"H\u00e9nin was released along with other French hostages in April 2014. He had been held captive alongside <mark>James Foley</mark>, Steven Sotloff, <mark>David Haines</mark> and Alan Henning, who were all murdered by Emwazi.\" Mohammed Emwazi was one of my captors. He is the one who murdered my friends, \"said H\u00e9nin.\" I can't prevent myself from thinking for the six murders that he committed, face to camera, murders of westerners, how many Syrians did he kill, and who cares for them? \"Related: Mohammed Emwazi killed my friend, but his own death won't affect the war | Sulome Anderson He said the jihadis lived in a parallel world and a\" different matrix \". They believed in a\" mad prophecy \"that there would be a global confrontation between a coalition of\" 80 armies against an army of Muslims coming from all over the world \"and were\" a bit out of their mind \". H\u00e9nin said:\" Why are we making so many mistakes? Why are people so much misunderstanding the region? We are just fuelling our enemies, and fuelling the misery, the disaster for the local people. \"He said the radicalisation was the result of passivity by the international community, who failed to assist Syrian democrats\" as they were yelling for their freedom, and the Syrians were living in total despair \". He said:\" For every single Syrian killed since the beginning of this conflict by Islamic State, between seven and 10 have been killed by the Syrian regime. We have to understand that these two parallel disasters for the Syrian people, they depend one on the other, and one cannot fight one without fighting the other. \"H\u00e9nin said the summer refugee crisis had been a propaganda blow to Isis. Images of refugees fleeing the Muslim\" dreamland \"and being welcomed in the lands of\" unbelievers \"had given a lie to their message of western hatred towards Muslims, he said.\" And that is why they probably tried to manipulate the public during the Paris attack, to make us close our borders, and maybe, even more importantly, to close our minds. \"There was an easy way to make Islamic State\" lose ground at high speed \"he said.\" It would be for the international community to take the decision that all the Syrian regions that are held by the opposition are no-fly zones; no-fly zones for everybody. Not the coalition, not the Russians, not the regime. Nobody. So, actually to provide security to the people would be devastating for Isis and this is what the international community should focus on, \"he said."}, {"articleID": "2019082212_00261851_W", "names": {"John Fleck": ["Q1333606", "Q572076"]}, "date": "2019-08-22", "url": "http://thelancasterandmorecambecitizen.co.uk/sport/national/17854416.blades-boss-wilder-backs-morrison-premier-league-role/", "content": "Blades boss Wilder backs Morrison for Premier League role By Press Association 2019 Ravel Morrison 0 comment Ravel Morrison is ready to make his first Premier League appearance in five years, according to Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder. The former Manchester United trainee is back in the English top flight after signing a 12-month deal with the Blades this summer, following spells in Italy, Mexico and Sweden. Morrison has yet to appear for Wilder's team in the opening two matches this season, not even making the bench, but did play in a behind-closed-doors game against his former club United this week. The 26-year-old forward, who can also play in midfield, will hope to be involved against Leicester at Bramall Lane on Saturday but if he is not then he will likely make his debut against Blackburn in the Carabao Cup on August 27. \"He's ready. He's been in both squads without playing but we played a behind-closed-doors game against Manchester United in the week and he played 90 minutes in that,\" said Wilder. \"It was a great exercise for us against about \u00a3 200million worth of talent. When we talked about playing a behind-closed-doors against Manchester United and then all of a sudden some unbelievably talented footballers came walking over towards our boys, it was a bit like\" wow, this is a proper game!' \"It was a good exercise for our boys against world-class players and we certainly appreciate the opportunity going over to Manchester United and them putting the game on for us.\" But Rav has a big part to play, he knows that. We talk about picking the side and it's a difficult selection process for myself and picking the subs as well. There's a lot of competition to even get on the bench and we need that. \"Wilder also revealed forward Callum Robinson will be fit for the weekend after coming off injured against Crystal Palace on Sunday. However, the news was not so good regarding midfielder <mark>John Fleck</mark>.\" We've a doubt about <mark>John Fleck</mark> but Callum has trained all week, \"he said.\" Those two both had to come off with injuries but we'll give <mark>John</mark> that time to recover. \"The Blades have made a solid start to life back in the Premier League, building on their opening-day draw at Bournemouth by defeating Palace 1-0. Ahead of Leicester's visit to Bramall Lane, Wilder insists his squad are not getting ahead of themselves.\" They won't get carried away, it's as simple as that, \"he said.\" They haven't done for three years so they certainly won't after two games in a different league. \"I've always kept my feet on the ground, I've never got ahead of myself. I think it's a dangerous game to do that whether you're a player, manager or a coach.\" At the moment I'm in the Premier League but I want to stay in here for a number of years and that's got to be our attitude. That's an attitude that's driven myself on personally and I look at our players and I see a lot of similarities in their approach as well. \"The drive from the staff and the message that comes across all the time is a consistent one so that's why I can confidently say that they'll never get ahead of themselves because it's not a trait that my team has.\" 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2009051110_00040688_W", "names": {"Brad Pitt": ["Q35332", "Q373912"]}, "date": "2009-05-11", "url": "http://dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1254986", "content": "melbourne: angelina jolie has sparked fears among the crewmembers of her new movie the actress, whose relationship with partner <mark>brad pitt</mark> is suggested to be on the rocks, has reportedly been shutting herself away in her trailer most days. a source says jolie's behaviour has fuelled speculation that she may have starting cutting herself again, a habit the actress has admitted to in the past. \"angie's been crying in her trailer most days and is barely eating. she keeps forgetting her lines and she's been shaking and staring into space,\" the daily telegraph quoted a movie insider as telling britain's now magazine. \"in fact, it's been so bad that some crew members have suspected she's using drugs, although that's out of the question. but the ones who know her realize it could be something much, much worse if she's self-harming. walk hand-in-hand on a deserted beach and get cosy with nature (and each other). your search for the ultimate luxury honeymoon destination ends right here their high-powered professional lives may lead you to believe their personal ones are on the back-burner. dna met achievers who have both worlds equally poised."}, {"articleID": "2018060312_00051694_W", "names": {"Ron Adams": ["Q18683794", "Q26899613", "Q7363452"], "Stephen Curry": ["Q352159", "Q43981708", "Q5573861"]}, "date": "2018-06-03", "url": "https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/03/warriors-try-to-solve-their-lebron-james-problem-in-game-2/", "content": "OAKLAND--For a decade now, the conventional wisdom on slowing down LeBron James and his teams came down to one basic tenet: Let him be a scorer, or let him be a passer, but don't let him be both. LeBron seems to have evolved past that in these playoffs. \"In the past that may have been true, but I think that every year it is different,\" Warriors assistant coach <mark>Ron Adams</mark> said of the scorer vs. passer idea. \"He's a different athlete right now, so the concerns about his offense, there are things he's doing better than in the past.\" \"There were parts of my game you could disrespect earlier in my career. You can't do that now,\" LeBron said more directly. The ability of No. 23 to control and change the game is the biggest challenge for Golden State heading into Game 2 Sunday at Oracle Arena. LeBron carved up the Warriors defense like a surgeon in Game 1. He was a scorer with the 51 points, but he was a passer too with eight assists--and he should have had a lot more, the Cavaliers shot 3-of-17 from three on passes from LeBron. It's not how the Cavaliers attacked the Warriors--using a high pick to force a switch that puts <mark>Stephen Curry</mark> or Kevon Looney on LeBron--that caused Golden State trouble. \"It's the fourth year, every year they've done the same thing,\" Shaun Livingston said. Rather, it was the Warriors execution of their defensive principles they think got them in trouble. It could have been a hangover from dealing with the simpler Rockets' attack. \"When you get switched onto LeBron, he's different from (James) Harden. He's going to look to pass early in a possession,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"They're running a lot of sets, really good sets where they isolate him. But then you've got (Kyle) Korver on a pindown or you've got (Kevin) Love off of a curl.\" So there's more going on around that isolated player, for the most part, with Cleveland. And LeBron obviously is such a great passer, he's going to try to pick you apart. \"\"He puts great stress on the defense,\" <mark>Adams</mark> said of LeBron. \"But we have our formulas we try to follow. He's gonna score, but we can do a better job than we did the first game....\" You're always going to make mistakes, you can't be perfect offensively or defensively. With mistakes, the question is how will you cover them up? Is your ball pressure good enough to, perhaps, take away the real penetrating part of passing that sets an offense up? \"In Game 1 it was not. The Warriors' communication also was not as sharp as it needed to be.\" I think in the first game we didn't communicate well, \"Looney said.\" We left (Kevin Durant) out there on an island on some of those screens without communicating. It is our job, and me as a big, to let him know when the screens are coming, and just be louder on the backside. \"Draymond (Green) talked to us, Andre (Iguodala) talked to us just about communicating. Our defense is a lot better when we're communicating and we're rotating and we're activated. LeBron is gonna make shots, he's a great scorer and been on a tear these whole playoffs, we've got to make it tough for him, make him work for each bucket, change the defense on him--he's such a smart player if you give him the same diet he's going to pick it apart, so just give him different looks and pray for the best.\" The Warriors want to make LeBron a jump shooter on Sunday night. Which sounds good, except in Game 1 LeBron was knocking down his jumpers (7-of-14). Still, that is better than the alternative. \"Once he gets into the paint, the defense breaks down and that's when you get into scramble mode, and I think where they are strongest,\" Livingston said. \"Guys are able to get involved and get their offense going.\" The Warriors also want to be more physical with LeBron in Game 2 (again, easier said than done). The bottom line is to not let LeBron get comfortable. \"I didn't think we made him work hard enough, though,\" Kerr said of Game 1. \"I thought everything was smooth sailing for him. It's one thing to have a philosophy where you're going to say, hey, we're going to make this guy beat us and shut everybody else down. You can have that philosophy in general. Lot of teams have done it with superstars in the past, whether you're talking about Kobe or Michael (Jordan) or LeBron or whoever.\" But it only works if you actually make the guy have to really use a lot of energy. That's not necessarily our strategy. Of course we're trying to keep other guys down, but we've got to make them work harder in general. I thought our defense was subpar the other night. \"If it's subpar again on Sunday night, the Warriors could be heading to Cleveland in a tie series."}, {"articleID": "2014051014_00040232_W", "names": {"Mark Henry": ["Q310073", "Q38915344", "Q6768003", "Q6768004"], "Brock Lesnar": ["Q220556", "Q25421397"], "Rob Van Dam": ["Q3360580", "Q44628"]}, "date": "2014-05-10", "url": "http://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe-smackdown/2014/5/10/5702626/wwe-smackdown-results-recap-reactions-may-9-2014-fight-on-friday-night", "content": "Share Share with Professional Wrestling friends WWE? Friday Night SmackDown hit the SyFy airwaves last night (May 9, 2014) from Buffalo, New York, with a taped show featuring continued fallout from Extreme Rules this past Sunday night in New Jersey as well as initial hype to the upcoming here for full results and the live blog from the show if you missed it. Let's get to reacting to the show. We fight on Friday night! Sometimes pro wrestling doesn't need angles to be fun. Sometimes the story doesn't even really matter and you get swept up in a match between two guys you didn't expect to sweep you up and you end up entertaining. Not that you weren't expecting it or anything, but did the idea of a Sheamus vs. Dean Ambrose program make anyone light up with glee? No; no it didn't. It's clear now, however, that it should have. William Regal once said of Ambrose \"he is everyone's best opponent for the next 10 years\" and this match may have proved our favorite Man's Man correct. Sheamus is in the process of becoming a heel WWE hopes will compete with Randy Orton at the top to carry the summer. I'm not sure how he'll do it with the U.S. title weighing him down, but perhaps a unification program with Bad News Barrett can help catapult him there. Either way, this was just a fun match that featured zero interference and a clean ending. Ambrose put up a hell of a fight against a guy you can call a HOSS, needing two Brogue Kicks to put him away, and this felt like a meaningful title match on what appeared to be a meaningless episode of SmackDown. More of this, please. Segment grade: A - __________________________________ Strength beyond strength At some point in the past eight months or so, <mark>Mark Henry</mark> became the really big guy slightly less bigger guys toss around so they can look impressive. And while I mourn for the loss of the Hall of Pain, seemingly forevermore, I celebrate the fact that hot young acts like Roman Reigns can be made to look like hot young stars. I mean look at that Samoan drop. That is one strong man relocating about 450 L-B-S (what up). This match also highlighted an attribute we've been needing to see from Reigns but weren't sure he would possess: his ability to sell injury to the point that he's vulnerable but not so much that he ever looks weak because of it. That's an incredibly difficult balancing act, but as you can see in the video above, he's already shockingly proficient at it. There are very big things in store for this man, beyond matches against big men like <mark>Henry</mark>. He is the push that makes you move On Cageside Live reviewing Raw this week, I boldly proclaimed Seth Rollins to be the next Shawn Michaels. Watching this match only solidified that viewpoint. Seriously, watch this match and pay close attention to everything Rollins does. Like Michaels, he's always in the right position. Like Michaels, his timing is impeccable. Like Michaels, his movement is flawless. And, like Michaels, he can be in the ring with a guy like Batista as the smaller man but never make you feel like he shouldn't be there. He's always believable and because of that, he'll always be credible. He'll need booking help later when he's on his own but tell me you wouldn't want to work a feud with that guy. He bumps like crazy, he's business, and, what's more, he elevates. How much better did Batista look in this match than he has since coming back? Who else has been able to make Batista look this good? Daniel Bryan, and that's the end of the list. Until last night when Seth Rollins actually made it one. All the best to all the rest: I think we may fast be approaching a point where Rusev isn't winning squash matches over jobbers but committing hate crimes against black wrestlers. We'll know if that's a joke or not if WWE trots JTG out as the next victim. Bray Wyatt's promos have started making a lot more sense and thankfully someone told the creative team that it's better to get to the point quickly because it doesn't matter how smooth your tongue is, if you're rambling on for 30 minutes, I'm checking out at 10. The beauty of pro wrestling is in the details. When Luke Harper tagged in to the main event match to stand opposite John Cena, he stopped with a crooked grin and leaned down next to Bray Wyatt to get some tactical advice on how to handle the situation. I surely liked this more than you, but it adds a wrinkle to the otherwise boring \"overwhelming monster charges Cena and gets overwhelmed himself\" booking. Here's my hope for future booking with Cesaro: He realizes that Paul Heyman is in this for himself and he needed a way to stay on television to continue harping on about <mark>Brock Lesnar</mark> breaking Undertaker's streak at WrestleMania. This is also why he's stuck in a mid-card program with the likes of <mark>Rob Van Dam</mark>, and he turns on Heyman just in time for <mark>Lesnar</mark> to come back to set up a match between the two at SummerSlam. Because wouldn't Cesaro vs. <mark>Lesnar</mark> be the best damn match at this point? And wouldn't that we a great explanation for how awful Cesaro has been booked since winning the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal and aligning with Heyman? And wouldn't it be a great way to re-introduce <mark>Lesnar</mark> leading to a match that would undoubtedly rule? The sooner Bad News Barrett moves away from Big E the better. As mentioned previously, let's hope for a Barrett-Sheamus program on the European tour where they unify the titles. Say, that's a good match for Payback. Why were Emma and Santino Marella so shocked and appalled at Fandango and Layla kissing? If I have to watch even one more Los Matadores vs. 3MB match I might just complain even more on the Internet. This was a pretty damn good episode of SmackDown. Overall grade: B That's it from me, Cagesiders.

Addressing a public gathering at Fatehpur (Jhelum), the minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government would provide all basic facilities to the masses as per the party's election manifesto. Lamenting over the attitude of previous governments, he said the common people were deprived of basic health and education facilities in the country while the children of former rulers used to study abroad and get medical treatment there. The schoolchildren in Pakistan, he said, did not have chairs to sit in classrooms with no English teachers, but those of the former rulers were studying in London. The rich even went abroad for treatment of minor diseases, he added. The minister said the farmers and common people of Jhelum and Domeli, which had historical significance, were struggling for their basic rights. Provision of clean drinking water and employment opportunities were their due rights like those of the main cities. The previous governments instead of giving priority to the basic issues, spent huge amounts on unnecessary projects like Orange Train and Metro Bus services, he added. Fawad said the people of Jhelum contributed billions of rupees to the national exchequer each year but the city was not getting its due right in development and welfare projects. He said funds of Rs 1,500 billion had been given to Balochistan in the past but there was not even a single well-equipped hospital in the province. Its people had to go to cities of other provinces to get treatment, he added. The minister said the attitude of opposition parties was not serious as they walked out of the parliament over the government's demand of accountability into corrupt practices committed during the last 10 years. \"They (opposition) claim that democracy is in danger when we stress for accountability into corruption of billions of rupees,\" he added. The government, he said, would, however, ensure accountability into embezzlement of billions of rupees--the money that actually belonged to the people of the country. \"Those having bikes before starting their political career are now owners of precious vehicles and they will be held accountable,\" he added. The minister said Prime Minister <mark>Imran Khan</mark> had always talked to strengthen the local government system in the country so that the public money could be spent for the welfare of common people and on improving the infrastructure at the grassroots level. Fawad said the government was committed to introduce such a local government system where the public funds would be utilized for the welfare and betterment of the masses. It was the government's responsibility to take steps for the uplift of remote areas, which was only possible through a vibrant local government system, he added. Member of the National Assembly Chaudhry Farrukh Altaf, members of the Punjab Assembly Raja Yawar Kamal and Sameera Javed, and notables of the area, including Raja Muhammad Munawer, were also present on the occasion. They briefed the minister about the issues being faced by the people of the area. The minister assured to resolve the problems on priority basis as the government would spend each and every penny from the public exchequer on the welfare of people.

cole hamels has reached another level in his spring training preparations. early in his career, hamels used the spring to build arm strength and establish his fastball and changeup. it worked through 2008, when he earned world series most valuable player honors. but after a subpar 2009 season, hamels reemphasized his offseason conditioning program and entered spring training '10 in excellent shape. he no longer needed to emphasize building arm strength, which allowed him to work on improving his cutter and curveball. this spring is a little different than last. hamels is in excellent shape again, but instead of developing his cutter and changeup, he is trying to fine-tune them. \"it's a lot nicer learning how to pitch and knowing how to pitch,\" hamels said after tossing two innings on saturday in a 5-4 victory over the new york yankees in both clubs' grapefruit league opener at george m. steinbrenner field. \"that's kind of what it takes to get to that next level--knowing how to attack certain hitters. that's something that, when you have those pitches and have them down, you can do a lot.\" if i can throw all four right now and work it all the way through spring, i should have them perfected by the season. that's something i don't think i've done as much in past seasons. it was just trying to establish a fastball and changeup, and then the other pitches kind of came. i think i was a little too late sometimes in the first part of the season. that's what i'm trying to take away, is being in season form and ready to go from the first game on. \"hamels allowed one hit, one unearned run and one walk over two innings on saturday. he struck out two and hit a batter.\" it was good, \"hamels said.\" just being able to get out there and do the up-down [between innings], that's something that is really hard to simulate. getting the hitters in there, the game rolling, sitting down and getting back up to have to ramp it up again, that's the part you have to get used to. it's fun. any time games start, it's a lot better than the practices. \"hamels is trying to work more on his cutter, which he essentially started throwing from scratch last spring.\" unfortunately, they weren't working too well [on saturday], \"hamels said.\" they were going down in the dirt. \"tickets but hamels expects the pitch to be a weapon again this season.\" i know how to pitch with it, and i think that's going to help, knowing when to throw it to certain hitters, \"hamels said,\" and also, trying to move it to both sides of the plate. i didn't really do it too much last year because it was something new. but watching cliff [lee] and \"doc' [halladay], those guys can go both to sides of the plate, and it's definitely helped them out, so that's something i'm definitely trying to establish.\" teammates and coaches have remarked on hamels' condition this spring. they seem particularly impressed, even after he looked so good last spring. \"i took the same approach i had last year in getting into the best shape i could,\" hamels said. \"that's what i've been able to do.\" hamels went just 12-11 last season, despite posting a 3.06 era. he seems primed for a big year in a rotation that could include a few big years. hamels has come a long way since he struck out derek jeter, <mark>alex rodriguez</mark> and <mark>tony clark</mark> in a hyped spring training appearance in 2004. \"then, i didn't know what the heck i was doing, so good things happened,\" hamels said with a smile. \"now, i'm just coming in and just trying to get my work in ....i guess you could say i'm more intelligent, in better shape [since facing the yankees in 2004].\" that was pretty much deer in the headlights, not knowing where you are or what you're doing and letting your talent take over. here, i know i have certain things i need to accomplish--goals for spring training--and i'm just trying to get into shape, because everything matters during the season, not in spring training. \"todd zolecki is a reporter for mlb.com. this story was not subject to the approval of major league baseball or its clubs .? 2001 - mlb advanced media, l.p. all
