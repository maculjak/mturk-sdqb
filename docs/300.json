Stalking and harassment affects millions of people in the UK and can have a devastating impact on victims, in some cases forcing them to change their daily routines and behaviours. Bedfordshire Police's investigations relating to stalking and harassment can sometimes be linked to some of the most serious crimes the force deals with, but it is keen to help residents spot the signs and ensure any suspicious activity is reported at an early stage. Stalking can be defined as persistent and unwanted attention causing a victim to feel pestered and harassed, and can affect people of all ages, ethnic origins and genders. Figures suggest 80 per cent of stalking victims are women, while one fifth (20 per cent) are men. In more than 80 per cent of cases, the victims are stalked by someone they know - whether it be a former partner, work colleague, family member or acquaintance. In addition, the threat posed by advances in technology has allowed for stalking to translate from the real world into cyberspace. As well as physical stalking behaviours such as following and watching victims, the crime now also takes place in the virtual world, with offenders targeting victims through persistent calls, disturbing emails and text messages and social media abuse, sometimes referred to as \"trolling'. Detective Superintendent <mark>Jon Gilbert</mark>, leading Bedfordshire Police's Cybercrime team, said:\" Stalking has become a cyber-enabled crime, allowing offenders to seek out their victims using social media and various technological means. \"Many of us now live our lives through Facebook and Twitter, but for those who have been a victim of trolling or persistent messaging, these social networks are a platform for distressing and often terrifying harassment .\" My message to stalkers - whether you are acting in real life or online - is that if you follow this threatening course of conduct, beware that this issue will be reported to us and we will take action against you. \"Bedfordshire Police will be posting information and advice relating to stalking throughout this week, using its Facebook page www.facebook.com/bedspolice and Twitter account @ BedsPolice. To follow all the tweets surrounding the initiative, follow the hashtag #NSAW 2015. The posts will feature facts and tips to encourage victims to come forward and report crimes, as well as personal safety messages for all Bedfordshire residents to help them spot the signs of stalking. If you think you are being stalked, seek advice from Bedfordshire Police or report an incident by calling 101.

The Hammers' once promising campaign has tailed off, with a run of just one win in 11 Barclays Premier League games seeing the club slip from Champions League contention to mid-table. Their latest disappointing result came at Manchester City on Sunday as they went down to an insipid 2-0 defeat. With Europe now not realistic and relegation not an issue, the Hammers would now seem to have little to play for but <mark>Jenkinson</mark> insists the remaining five games are not meaningless. The 23-year-old, who has enjoyed a successful season-long loan from Arsenal and could make the switch permanently, said: \"People in our dressing room are fired up. If you came in the changing room after the game you'd see that .\" People aren't resting on their laurels, people ain't happy finishing mid-table. We want to kick on. We have got something to prove now because we have been on a bad run of games and we want to put that right. We owe that to ourselves and the fans. \"West Ham were never in the game at the Etihad Stadium, losing after a bizarre own goal from <mark>James Collins</mark> and a swift counter-attack strike from Sergio Aguero before half-time. Enner Valencia and <mark>Kevin Nolan</mark> did have late chances after City lost momentum following injury to <mark>David Silva</mark> but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest. <mark>Jenkinson</mark> felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season. He said:\" I wouldn't want to blame it on luck but a few things haven't gone our way lately and we have conceded some late goals. \"I think this was a different story - we made a couple of mistakes and got punished .\" Of course we have got to work on our performances but if you look at the last 10 games, our performances haven't been bad at all. \"We have had some really good performances but teams have scored late goals against us and we have ended up getting a point instead of three. It has been a bit frustrating .\" I just think early on in the season we were finishing everything. Everything we got was going in the back of net and at important times of the game. \"We have gone ahead in recent games but never killed the games off and have ended up conceding cheaply towards the end of the game. Of course that is a real kick in the teeth .\" It is not nice blaming things on luck - you make your own luck - but that has been the story of our last couple of months. \"", "articleID": "2015042120_00025113_W", "names": {"Carl Jenkinson": ["Q29497", "Q53755281"], "David Silva": ["Q161069", "Q2513023", "Q27580161", "Q5239792", "Q58454602"], "James Collins": ["Q10490126", "Q158980", "Q18160363", "Q19286436", "Q3806506", "Q3808408", "Q51585390", "Q54863756", "Q6131576", "Q6131582", "Q6131585"], "Kevin Nolan": ["Q148699", "Q6397100"]}}, {"date": "2015-04-21", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/shyp-raises-50-million-2015-4", "content": "Just because it's worth $1 billion doesn't mean it's a unicorn, says VC who lived through the last bubble Oscar, a fast-growing startup that wants to shake up healthcare, just raised $145 million at a $1.5 billion valuation These are five of New York's most highly anticipated startups you need to know Shipping packages is a huge headache. So in March 2014, Shyp launched to make the process as easy as taking a picture of what you want to mail, pressing a single button to summon a delivery person, and having your package shipped. On Tuesday, Shyp announced that it had raised a $50 million Series B round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, with participation from previous investors including Homebrew and Sherpa Ventures, and angel investors like <mark>Kevin Rose</mark> and Rent The Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman, bringing the startup's total funding to date to $62.2 million.

The company also announced the launch of a beta program in Los Angeles, in addition to the three cities where it currently operates: New York, Miami, and San Francisco. The new funding will allow Shyp to continue to expand throughout the US, to grow its team, and to develop new features. (In March, Shyp rolled out a feature for returns .) Since its last round of funding in July 2014, the company says it's seeing 20 percent month-over-month customer growth, has \"tens of thousands\" of customers, and its number of shipments has increased by nearly 500%. \"This is a momentous day for Shyp.

Saudi Arabia to see big growth in solar power BURNABY, Canada, 2 days ago Increasing government focus on renewable energy programme coupled with rising power demand will drive Saudi Arabia's solar power market to experience robust growth rate through 2020, a report said. Being located on the equatorial Sun Belt with high solar radiation and vast stretches of empty desert with clear skies, makes the country an ideal location for solar power generation, added the report \"Saudi Arabia Solar Power Market Forecast & Opportunities, 2020\" published by TechSci Research, a global market research and consulting company. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2014, Saudi Arabia was the largest producer of crude oil in the world and the country consumes a large amount of crude oil for electricity production. Continuing increase in population growth rate, urbanization and industrial development have resulted in rise in consumption of crude oil so as to meet the country's growing energy demand. As a result of increasing domestic consumption of crude oil for power generation, Saudi Arabia's government is increasing its focus to explore alternate sources for power generation. <mark>King Abdullah</mark> City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K ACARE) has already introduced a renewable energy programme for adding 54 GW additional power generation capacity from renewable sources with an investment of $109 billion by 2032. Solar power is expected to contribute around 41 GW of overall power capacity additions by 2032. \"K A CARE renewable energy programme would be a major driving factor for solar power industry in Saudi Arabia in coming years. The country is more focussed towards generating solar power from concentrated solar power technology,\" said Karan Chechi, research director with TechSci Research. The report analyses the future growth potential of solar power market in Saudi Arabia and provides statistics and information on market size and solar power industry.

I think they take pride in our province as the economic engine of this country .\" The election was supposed to be a coronation for <mark>Prentice</mark> when he called it a year earlier than required, with the opposition parties in disarray. But opinion polls have suggested there is a tight three-way race among the Tories, the NDP and the Opposition Wildrose under leader Brian Jean, and some of the most recent surveys put the NDP in front. The Tories have been in power in Alberta since 1971. The NDP has never held more than 16 seats. The debate tussle between <mark>Prentice</mark> and Notley reached a climax in an exchange over corporate taxes, with <mark>Prentice</mark> mocking Notley with the quip \"I know math is difficult .\" The hashtag \"#mathishard\" instantly became popular on Twitter, with many users labelling the remark as patriarchal and even sexist. <mark>Prentice</mark> said he wasn't trying to be mean-spirited and was referring to a math error by the NDP earlier in the campaign. \"I did not mean any disrespect to Rachel Notley and I'm sure she knows that .\" Asked if she considered <mark>Prentice</mark>'s comments sexist or condescending, Notley said: \"Not at all .\" Doug Griffiths, a former PC cabinet minister who isn't running in this election, said the math comment is a disappointing distraction. \"If <mark>Jim</mark> had turned and said that to Brian Jean, I don't think anyone would have said anything,\" Griffiths said. \"But he said it to Rachel and it sounded patronizing and belittling...I know <mark>Jim</mark> and I don't think he intended it that way at all .\" Griffiths said there was no doubt that Notley \"did exceptionally well .\" \"<mark>Jim</mark> really needed to tie and I think he was a very close second .\" Duane Bratt, political scientist at Mount Royal University, said the math comment shows <mark>Prentice</mark> is on the razor's edge as far as his image goes. \"It ties into the reputation that <mark>Prentice</mark> has of this arrogant elitist mansplaining to Rachel how arithmetic works .\" While Notley and <mark>Prentice</mark> duked it out, the premier often turned his back to Jean. <mark>Prentice</mark> shrugged off suggestions he was dismissive, citing his frustration with how specific Jean was being about proposed Wildrose spending cuts. Jean said he had no concerns with it. \"I'm not going to comment on the professionalism of other people in that particular debate,\" he told reporters at an event in Edmonton. \"I'll let people decide for themselves if they see what took place if that's the person they want for their premier, then that's the person they want for their premier .\" Notley urged Albertans Friday not to look to the Wildrose as an alternative to the Tories. She said the two parties have plenty of things in common and the Wildrose is quickly becoming a non-factor. 504 - 7th Street South Lethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7 (403) 328-4536 Print Advertising: (403) 328-4410 National Advertising: (403) 380-7585 Online Advertising: (403) 380-7585", "articleID": "2015042623_00001739_W", "names": {"Jim Prentice": ["Q19877246", "Q364303"]}}]
