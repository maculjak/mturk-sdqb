nosing around, it's clear that size limits will be landed. that's not all. in 2010 national mandatory saltwater sportfishing reporting will begin. put your fingers to block your nostrils. this is the water on ice in creating the briny hawaii saltwater fishing license. hfn contacted the tuna tagging project's david itano, research associate at uh school of ocean and earth science and technology. itano confirmed the dar tuna limit talk: \"i attended a dar meeting last friday night on catch limits and bag limits. concentrating on weke, uhu and papio/ulua species. however, they did raise the ahi question.... basically there seems to be interest in raising the minimum size from many sectors but to what and how is the question .\" tuna size limits for hawaii is loudly controversial and as wanted as a poorly maintained 130 penn screaming with a tight drag ready to freeze up on a gorilla ahi. pounding against limits are kau kau sport fishermen and the near shore commercial guys. even with threats of maiming and misfortune neither throw back 45 pound tuna. traditionally, local fishermen are the apex predators for ahi. local politicians understand the food chain and until now dare not separate sashimi from chop sticks. this time it's different. enter the feds and they eat fish with fork and knives. noaa, the department of commerce agency charged with fish management, is changing the local fish politics playing field. noaa's marine recreational information program (mrip) is \"being phased in to.... provide a reliable, transparent, collaborative set of tools that managers, anglers and others can use to ensure sustainable fisheries and healthy oceans for generations to come .\" mrip is an expanded national marine creel survey. creel survey? you remember those awkward questions at the wash down ramps. lest we forget the lolo malihini telephone interviews from new hampshire about what's a \"marhee marhee?\" noaa realizes the dilemma of bureaucrats with fighting chairs behind desks. it wants better fishy field samples answers. who fishes? what's being caught? how many fish are caught? where and when are people fishing? it's fish catch data collection 101. mrips will \"fill survey data gaps, bias, consistency, accuracy, and timeliness .\" how prey tell? enter the national saltwater angler registry, \"providing a much more efficient and effective route for collecting data .\" all ocean states must register. but states that have a salt water fishing licensing program can be exempted. states without saltwater fishing licenses include connecticut, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, maine, massachusetts, rhode island, the western pacific, caribbean territories and hawaii. acceptable licensing or data collection programs get a memorandum of agreement with noaa. the memorandum allows states to share angler information required by the noaa's mrip registry. registry of what? noaa says that the national saltwater angler registry \"will be a\" phone book' of sport fishermen. \"beginning in 2010, people who live in states without such a program will have to sign up with the registry each year, and\" perhaps \"pay a fee. and\" perhaps \"postage stamps will go down in price? hawaii commercial fishermen already are exempted. they pay a mrip's qualifying license fee of $50 dollars to dar. hawaii commercial fishers face newly implemented stiff fines if they do not report fish catches monthly within 2 weeks of the month's end. having a hawaii commercial license signs you up to give up all rights against illegal search and seizure. by law a fee of $25 dollars can be charged by noaa for hawaii sport fishermen to register in the\" phone book. \"noaa doesn't want to get in the saltwater fishing license business. the state of hawaii has repeatedly proposed a fishing license only to be shot down by local politicians. this time for saltwater fishing licenses it's different. the state\" wen broke \"and local politicians can say:\" the feds made me do it. \"the only question left is where do i sign up? how about the question of whether fish size limits matter? we contacted <mark>dr.</mark> randy kochevar, science communications, at stanford's hopkins marine station. <mark>dr.</mark> kochevar, who is helping coordinate hibt's\" great marlin race, \"wrote hfn:\" i found.... some references you might find pertinent and useful to this topic. here you go: \"a j. bohnsack published in 2000, an article entitled\" a comparison of the short-term impacts of no-take marine reserves and minimum size limits. \"here's an exerpt:\" despite higher natural mortality for younger age classes, fishing mortality on juveniles can be particularly harmful to a fish population since the fish have not yet reproduced. this effect is compounded when quotas are based on weight since a larger number of fish are taken. \"similar size limit findings are found in the 2006\" bulletin of marine science \"article\" evolutionary regime shifts in age and size at maturation of exploited fish stocks. proceedings of the royal society b 273: 1873-1880. \"it was written by authors am de roos, ds boukal and l persson. <mark>dr.</mark> kochevar says of that article:\" there is ample evidence that fisheries management can affect the genetic composition, life history characteristics, and general biology of a population. these changes can quickly become irreversible (de roos et al. 2006). \"kochevar further writes that\" multiple studies suggest that minimum sizes in fisheries should be set at the age of maturation (smith and abramson 1990, purves et al. 2003, foster and vincent 2005). increased mortality of juveniles has been shown to select for later maturation and decreased reproductive potential (reznick et al. 1990, gardmark and dieckmann 2006). \"so there is a case for fish management size limits. will noaa implement them? noaa says that mrips\" will give saltwater anglers better representation in the policy-making process. \"looking to what has happened on the atlantic coast we see that the policy making process likes limits, permits and reports. according to the noaa office of sustainable fisheries, the recreational minimum size limit for atlantic bluefin, bigeye and yellowfin is 27 inches. size limits beget bag limits:\" regardless of the length of the trip, no more than 3 yellowfin tuna per person may be possessed on board a vessel. \"what about reporting? besides the fish license mandated reporting, for the atlantic there's recreational hotline reporting:\" within 24 hours of landing (killing and bringing to shore) any bluefin tuna, blue marlin, white marlin, swordfish, or sailfish that were caught in federal waters, recreational vessel owners must report the landing to noaa fisheries. call 1-800-894-5528. \"don't forget the highly migratory species permit .\" recreational vessel owners fishing for atlantic hms must hold a valid atlantic hms angling category permit for their vessel. \"how do you get a permit? just call the atlantic tunas information line at (888) 872-8862 or visit. all hawaii tunas, sharks, marlin, mahi mahi, ono, spearfish, sailfish are highly migratory species. in the atlantic skipjack tuna are not limited or permitted. mahi and ono will likely not be restricted in hawaii. it is only a matter of time before marlin and bigeye are restricted and likely yellowfin to follow. are you catching more or less aku? ask yourself if aku will ever have a size limit, bag limit or permit? don't have an aku answer? purse seine one up. one caveat for noaa is that hawaii's sportfishing tuna are easy to target and easier to manage than the world's biggest tuna catchers, the purse seiners. in 2007 224,000 tons of bigeye were caught, mostly by purse, in the pacific. hfn contacted <mark>dr. john</mark> hampton a tuna expert with the spc tuna program located in noumea, new caledonia. hampton and his agency are keepers of all commercial tuna data for the western and central pacific. he explained why purse seiner size limits won't work:\" a strict minimum size limit on bigeye (or other tunas) is unlikely to work because of the difficulty in separating the small bigeye from skipjack of the same size caught by purse seine (which is the main source of small bigeye tuna catch in the western and central pacific). even if they could be separated, it would be impossible to return them to the water alive after being caught by purse seine. thus far, there have been efforts to reduce the catch of juvenile bigeye by other means, such as reducing the reliance of the purse seine fishery on fads (which is how most of the bigeye is caught). there may also be other operational measures that could be effective. \"limits, permits and reports are nothing compared to tuna fishery closures brought on by purse seine over harvesting. tuna fishing in the eastern pacific, all nations on the entire pacific coast of latin america, will be banned for 59 days in 2009, 62 days in 2010 and 73 days in 2011. the closure is a directive of the inter-american tropical tuna commission (iattc). iattc is made up of 10 latin american nations and the united states, japan, spain, south korea, france and vanuatu. the united states means noaa. the eastern pacific tuna ban is\" to avoid the catastrophic collapse of valuable stocks of yellowfin (thunnus albacares), bigeye (thunnus obesus) and skipjack (katsuwonus pelamis) tuna. \"calls are already out for drastic measures for central and western pacific tuna including closures. noaa will license hawaii fishermen to collect the data to enforce the policy restrictions that follow worldwide collapsing tuna schools. what will the tuna size limit be in hawaii. david itano sheds some light:\" you probably know that dar has taken on l50 as their mantra in managing coral reef and bottomfish species and even have a big poster listing the l50 sizes of weke, omilu, paka, etc. \"what is l50? l50 is the measure, usually in terms of length in centimeters, at which half of the the estimated fish population sampled are sexually mature. the state is assuming that the l50 for tuna is 45 pounds. according to experts, l50 has some fish management problems like sexually maturity varies between males and females. l50 also varies from one one bio-region to another. yellowfin tuna have a different l50 when compared to eastern pacific, atlantic or australian yellowfin. itano relates this can be from different migration paths, local productivity and feed. in sum itano says:\" due to the population dynamics of tuna, l50 has never been used as a minimum size guideline for tuna species.... \"ahi will be likely regulated like atlantic tuna are. an example is the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas that states:\" contracting parties and co-operating non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities (cpcs) shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the catch, the retaining on board, landing and/or transshipment of any bluefin tuna (thunnus thynnus) weighing less than 10 kg in the mediterranean sea. \"this is 22 pounds in the mediterranean and 14 pounds in east atlantic and european waters. since noaa, not dar, rules pelagics and therefore tuna conservation in hawaii, they will mimic the atlantic regulations. the hawaii tuna size limit will be at 27 inches. this is an ahi weighing 14.7 pounds. this in from kona's joe dettling...tuna researcher and commercial fisherman.... j next post/next comment k previous post/previous comment", "articleID": "2010011511_00079319_W", "names": {"Dr. John": ["Q511074", "Q54593093"]}}, {"date": "2010-01-15", "url": "http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2010/01/15/12475086-sun.html?cid=rssnews", "content": "jurors were sent home early yesterday after the star witness in the murder tr ial of three winnipeg men couldn't stop vomiting while under cross-examination. \"i think the record should reflect that the witness is vomiting,\" said defence lawyer <mark>jeff nichols</mark> as danny simao, sitting in the witness box, threw up into a garbage can perched between his legs. simao is testifying in the trial of his cousin <mark>carlos tavares</mark>, glen sherman monkman, and norris ponce. the men are charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of 24-year-old minh hong huynh. simao told court wednesday he suffers from irritable bowel syndrome and acid reflux and is prone to vomiting when under stress. <mark>nichols</mark> was questioning simao yesterday afternoon about inconsistencies between his police statements and his testimony at a preliminary hearing when simao put his hands to his mouth and threw up into a garbage can. court was adjourned twice before crown attorney carla dewar told justice brenda keyser that simao was too sick to continue. keyser sent jurors home shortly after 3 p.m. simao is expected to be on the witness stand for up to five days. the crown alleges monkman repeatedly stabbed huynh outside the former club desire on main street. earlier in the week, simao testified he had been drinking with the three accused at the former freehouse restaurant and bar in osborne village when <mark>tavares</mark> received a call on his cellphone and they left to go to \"a rave .\" during the drive, simao said he heard discussion \"a guy that stabbed my cousin was going to be at the rave.
