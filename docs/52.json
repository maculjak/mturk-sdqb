Her new article, titled \"What Can't Be Debated on Campus,\" was published in The Wall Street Journal on Feb. 15 and explores the \"unreasoned speech\" she encountered in response to her original Philadelphia Inquirer op-ed. Wax's piece has raised questions about how Penn Law handled the ensuing furor over her controversial opinions and invited rancorous debate from professors and students over her teaching a mandatory, first-year course. In the op-ed, which Wax adapted from a speech she delivered in December, she accused Dean of Penn Law Theodore Ruger of asking her to \"take a leave of absence next year\" and stop teaching her civil procedure class, which is required for first-year students. \"When I suggested that it was his job as a leader to resist such illiberal demands, he explained that he is a\" pluralistic dean' who must listen to and accommodate \"all sides,'\" Wax wrote. Penn Law spokesperson Steven Barnes sharply disputed Wax's claim in a statement sent to The Daily Pennsylvanian. \"Professor Wax is a valued member of our faculty and nothing has changed in her status,\" Barnes said. He described the conversation with Wax as a \"discussion with the dean about the timing of a regularly-accrued sabbatical, a discussion the dean has with many faculty members each year, as every tenured faculty member enjoys a sabbatical benefit, with full pay .\" Wax also took aim at her colleagues, including the group of 33 professors who criticized her in an open letter published in August in the DP. Their piece contained \"no argument, no substance, no reasoning, no explanation whatsoever as to how our op-ed was in error,\" she wrote. One of the co-writers of the open letter, Penn Law professor Jonah Gelbach, said Wax's piece in the Journal initially omitted the fact that he and two other legal scholars wrote extensive rebuttals to Wax in the fall. Gelbach's essay, titled \"Facts v. Wax,\" was published in September and is over 14,000 words long. \"The version of the op-ed that now appears online contains a sentence acknowledging those posts, but only because I shamed a WSJ editor into adding it,\" he wrote in an email. At the bottom of Wax's article, an addendum now reads, \"The essay has been updated to note that two signers of the open letter condemning Ms. Wax's op-ed later wrote substantive responses to her arguments .\" The piece has been amended to note the two responses to Amy Wax posted at Heterodox Academy and linking to them. https: //t.co/9tSIoTjxEU--Gary Rosen (@ garyrosenWSJ) February 18, 2018 Gelbach also said he sent an early draft of the Heterodox Academy essay to Wax, but she responded by saying that she did not have time to read it. (Wax did not respond to repeated requests for comment .) In addition to openly questioning Ruger's conduct, Wax has also reopened a debate about her fitness to teach a mandatory course for 1Ls, some of whom advocated for her removal. \"A couple weeks before we even got here, she publishes an op-ed openly denigrating cultural backgrounds of students who are then required to take her class,\" said Vivek Kembaiyan, a 1L student who sits on the Council of Student Representatives for Penn Law. \"Students who've had her [are] apprehensive about going to her office hours, or asking for a recommendation, because they come from one of the specific backgrounds that she calls out in her op-ed .\" In the fall, the Penn Black Law Students Association and the Penn chapter of the National Lawyers Guild called on Wax to be barred from teaching the course. B.J. Courville, a 1L student, said she has separately petitioned faculty members to remove Wax from the first-year curriculum as well. \"At the end of the day I deserve the same education and the same safe learning environment as the person next to me, from a strictly economic standpoint,\" Courville said. But months after that debate receded from the minds of many higher education observers, Penn Law students remain divided over Wax's standing. \"There are a lot of times when I find myself at odds with the opinions of my professors,\" 3L student Mia Rendar said. \"I don't think it's right to punish someone for giving an independent opinion .\" Conservative sites like Breitbart and the National Review have rallied behind her and Wax has said she received many supportive emails in response to her original Inquirer piece. Other critics who disagree with her argument about bourgeois cultural values have decried the style of ad hominem attacks that refer to her a \"Nazi\" and a \"racist .\" \"Every open letter you sign to condemn a colleague for his or her words brings us closer to a world in which academic disagreements are resolved by social force and political power, not by argumentation and persuasion,\" wrote scholar Jon Haidt in an essay defending Wax.

Weeks before arriving in Owasso, Ernest William Kuehne IV--also known as Will--had already befriended Rams receiver Dylan Chinn, using the social media site. When Kuehne (pronounced \"key-knee\" ) was finally on the ground in Ram Town, their friendship deepened. Soon, senior running back Bryce Cabrera joined the club. Today, the three are inseparable. They're also key components, along with Josh Proctor, <mark>Wayne Jones</mark>, Tyrese Sisson, Devin Tyler, <mark>Sam Thompson</mark>, Courtre Alexander, Tyler Moody and Duece Mayberry, in what has to be the reclamation project of the year in Oklahoma high school football. Coming off two sub-par seasons, in their first year under local coaching legend Bill Blankenship, the Rams are 4-0, ranked No. 2 and headed into a 7:05 p.m. Friday showdown at No. 1 Union, 6A Division I defending champion. Cox3 will televise a potential preview of the state final. Kuehne, a junior, needed less than two full weeks of spring practice to begin separating himself as the Rams' starting quarterback. In his first four starts, he's completed 71 percent of his passes for 989 yards and 14 touchdowns, with only one interception, leading an offense that averages 54 points and 495.1 yards per game. \"He's still a work in progress, but he has played well,\" Blankenship said. \"There's a whole lot he can improve on fundamentally, but it's encouraging to have a quarterback who's been able to do what he's done so far. He's always taking notes. He's a student of the game. He makes a point of trying to learn everything he's been exposed to .\" Owasso's fast start has ignited a mountainous surge in fan interest. An estimated 11,600 spectators saw the home opener against Broken Arrow three weeks ago. Rams athletic director Zach Duffield called it likely \"an all-time record for Owasso Stadium .\" Another 8,000 to 9,000 watched the district opener against Mustang last week. Union officials are expecting 13,000 on Friday. \"It's really exciting when the stands are full and the whole town comes out to watch us play,\" Kuehne said. \"That gets the whole team fired up. But we can't be focused on that. We have to focus on what we need to do to keep getting better .\" Kuehne couldn't be happier with his new hometown. \"I love it. It's a great place,\" he said. \"The people are awesome and I've really connected with the team. There's not much I don't like about it. I think it's the perfect place for me and for my family .\" Who is Kuehne and where did he come from? How did he arrive at the perfect moment, and with just the right skills necessary to run Blankenship's spread-the-ball, take-what-the-defense-gives-you system with near perfection? Some suspect he was recruited for the purpose. But as Kuehne tells the story, he recruited himself. Or his father did. Golf fans shouldn't have any trouble recognizing the name \"Trip\" Kuehne. The former Oklahoma State three-time All-American golfer--and Will's father--was part of a Cowboys' 1995 national championship team and received the Ben Hogan Award that same year as the nation's top collegiate golfer. In 1994, he was also part of the dramatic U.S. Amateur championship, finishing runner-up to his good friend and soon-to-be-legend, Tiger Woods. In the 36-hole, match-play final, Kuehne led by five holes with 12 to play at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. But Woods rallied in stunning fashion, foreshadowing his spectacular professional career. \"It was tough, but to that point, it was some of the best golf I've ever played in my life,\" Trip Kuehne said. \"Sometimes, you can play as good as you possibly can and come up on the short end of the stick. That's a little of what happened .\" The Dallas native saw the painful loss as an omen. Instead of turning pro, he returned to OSU to complete his master's degree and prepare for a business career. Today he runs a successful investment management company, Double Eagle Capital. Trip has never watched tape of the match, but he refers to it as \"a blessing in disguise .\" Once back in Stillwater, he met his future bride. The former Dusti Stuart was a Cowgirls basketball player from Shattuck. Had they not gotten together, there would be no Will Kuehne. This time last season, Will was a sophomore football player at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas. The family was satisfied with Liberty, but for several reasons, Tripp had been looking to move his family north for several years. For starters, the Kuehnes are OSU season-ticket holders with multiple ties to the Stillwater campus. Dusti's father, the late Jiggs Stuart, was a letterman football and baseball player at Oklahoma A & M in the early \"40s .\" So there really is some orange that runs through our bodies, \"Trip said. Trip wanted to move his wife closer to her mother and Will wanted to move closer to his private quarterback trainers, Joe Dickinson and Joe McCulley. Dickinson is a former offensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma, University of Tulsa and Central Oklahoma, with 35 years of college and high school coaching experience. McCulley is a former TU quarterback and offensive innovator who coached high school football at Grove, Tahlequah, Broken Bow, Coalgate, Kiowa and Hennessey. He was also superintendent at Hennessey (in western Oklahoma) before announcing his retirement in October 2015. He moved to Collinsville last year. Both were working with quarterbacks for DeBartolo Sports University, an organization dedicated to training young athletes, when Will and his father attended a DeBartolo event five years ago in Oklahoma City. At the time, Will was a sixth-grader at tiny Westlake (Texas) Academy. He had just been introduced to the idea of playing quarterback and wanted private instruction.

Last year at Liberty, he played safety and a smattering of quarterback. He's also played receiver and linebacker. McCulley said Will's experience with other positions has given him a unique perspective for playing quarterback .\" He understands the physical part of the game, \"McCulley said .\" Nothing is more potentially demoralizing for a quarterback than getting hit, but I was noticing in the Jenks game that he was able to stand in there, take the hit and put the ball out there. He understands getting hit and getting up. It gives him a chance to be special. \"McCulley also likes Kuehne's\" innate ability \"to control his emotions .\" He has that temperament. It comes from being part of a family of athletes. He's been around athletes his whole life, \"McCulley said. Will's aunt and uncle were also standout golfers. Kelli Kuehne won four straight Texas high school state titles for Highland Park (1992-95), won the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1995 and had won an LPGA Tour tournamnet before injuries cut short her career. Hank Kuenhe played college golf at OSU and SMU and had four wins on the PGA Tour. Many consider the Kuehne siblings the most successful in U.S. amateur golf history. At least two or three years ago, Trip was considering private schools in the Tulsa area. McCulley had worked with Lincoln Christian's 2015 standout, Micah Wilson, and recommended Lincoln and a few others. Had the family moved then, Will might be playing for Cascia Hall, Lincoln or Holland Hall right now. But then, he couldn't have become Blankenship's bandleader. Blankenship won three state titles and 154 games over 14 Union seasons (1992-05). In 2012, he won a Conference USA title and Liberty Bowl in his best of four seasons at the TU helm. Trip said he knew Blankenship\" only by reputation. I knew he had coached at TU and was a great high school coach. We decided to move for our own reasons, but when Bill got the Owasso job (in January), it became kind of a no-brainer. Where else could you play high school football where the coach has won a (college) conference title and a bowl game? \"Will arrived in March, just in time for the final nine weeks of Owasso's school year. The family's Westlake home sold in 18 days, but their initial contract on an Owasso residence fell through before another property in Stone Canyon became available. Trip operates his business from a separate building that was used by the previous owner for his model-train hobby. The family belongs to The Patriot Golf Club, but Trip, a two-time Texas high school state champion at Highland Park and three-time Walker Cup qualifier, plays less golf than he once did. He's having more fun these days following his son's football career, and Will just isn't that interested in chasing the little white ball .\" His dream has always been to play quarterback and we're going to let him chase that dream and see how good he can be, \"Trip said. Then, he added with a chuckle,\" We keep his golf score by how many balls he loses. \""}, {"articleID": "2011091710_00022079_W", "names": {"Tim Burgess": ["Q2433840", "Q7803247"]}, "date": "2011-09-16", "url": "http://overheadbin.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/16/7781454-seattle-hotels-step-up-to-fund-tourism-promotion", "content": "recommended: seattle hotels step up to fund tourism promotion recommended: at long last, a historic carousel rides again time pubdate datetime = \"2011-09-16t08:35:31 -04:00\" > ago seattle hotels step up to fund tourism promotion three months after washington's tourism office was shuttered, a group of major downtown seattle hotels is backing a tourism improvement area to fund such promotion through a $2-a-night surcharge on hotel rooms. by elaine porterfield, msnbc.com contributor it's no secret that tourists and business travelers bring much-needed dollars to municipalities, but in the face of the unrelenting recession, many state and city budgets for tourism promotion around the nation have been slashed, if not eliminated. a group of major seattle hotels, faced with similar problems such as the closure of the washington state tourism office in june, has thrown their support behind a tourism improvement area to fund such promotion through a $2-a-night surcharge on hotel rooms. san diego is another city that uses such taxes for promoting tourism. the money is desperately needed to keep their industry moving forward, said howard cohen, president of the seattle hotel association and manager of three downtown hotels for clise properties, inc. when the state of colorado eliminated its tourism office several years ago, it ended up losing a third of its tourism business, cohen said. \"we're trying to take the bull by the horns ourselves,\" he said. seattle city councilman <mark>tim burgess</mark>, who first proposed the idea, said that it's anticipated that $6 million would be raised the first full year of the tax in 2012. \"if invested in the (tourism) promotion of seattle, according to most estimates of economists, it would mean about $30 to $33 million in economic gain,\" <mark>burgess</mark> said. the proposed room tax, which will be considered tuesday by the seattle city council regional development and sustainability committee, has the support of mayor mike mcginn, said brian surratt, the city's business development director. if it passes through that committee, it will go before the full city council on sept. 26. cohen says they hope to have the tax in place by the beginning of november. surratt, who called the closure of the state tourism office devastating for destination travel to washington, said the city was excited to see the private hotel industry step up and embrace the surcharge. \"tourism dollars are great for economic development,\" surratt said. \"it's outside money coming here that stays here...it's a win-win for all. we've got roughly 20,000 people employed in tourism here. that's a huge chunk of our jobs (in seattle).\" overall in washington, tourism is a $15.2 billion industry that supports nearly 144,000 jobs, contributes nearly $1 billion in local and state tax revenues and ranks fourth in gross domestic product produced in washington, according to the seattle's convention and visitors bureau. the nightly tax would be applied to hotels around downtown seattle, including the core shopping area, trendy belltown, the international district and bustling south lake union, the new neighborhood of online retail giant amazon.

These product architectures comprise the rear-wheel drive architecture (MRA), the front-wheel-drive architecture (MFA), the architectures for SUVs (MHA) and sports cars (MSA) as well as the powertrain architecture (MPA) The MRA production network (S -, E -, C-Class) is led by Andreas Kellermann, who was previously head of the Bremen plant. Michael G\u00f6bel is now in charge of global compact car production (A -, B-Class, CLA, GLA and in the future CLA Shooting brake), having previously overseen roadster production in Bremen. Production of SUVs (M -, R -, GL -, and G-Class) and sports cars (SL, SLK) is the responsibility of Jason Hoff, who also retains his existing role as President and CEO of Mercedes-Benz U.S. plant in Tuscaloosa/Alabama (MBUSI). Peter Schabert, who has been responsible for global powertrain production since 2010, will continue in this position unchanged. Each vehicle and powertrain architecture will draw on a system of modules and components. The new C-Class is the first model series to be built entirely in accordance with this principle. The C-Class is Mercedes-Benz's highest-volume model series and went into production on four continents within just six months earlier this year: Bremen came first in February, followed by the East London plant (South Africa) in May, the Tuscaloosa plant (USA) in June, and the BBAC plant in Beijing (China) in July. Within the global production network, Bremen is the lead plant and manages all aspects of C-Class production, from the tooling strategy and quality assurance to the training of colleagues from other sites worldwide. The company is thereby ensuring that the highest standards are met at all production sites right from the outset. Around 500 employees from plants outside Germany have received intensive training so that, as multipliers, they can pass on their knowledge within their home plants. \"Our German passenger car and powertrain plants form the backbone of our global production network. The achievements of the teams in all four plants are second to none: they have done an outstanding job in launching the C-Class at four sites in such a short space of time,\" stated <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark>. Making sure that every production facility delivers the high quality that is synonymous with the Mercedes-Benz brand is just one aspect of the redefined quality management function. \"Our quality remit covers every area of Mercedes-Benz Cars, from product development to customers,\" said <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark>. He believes that providing innovative manufacturing processes is also a part of quality management: \"It means our designers and developers are able to launch exceptional vehicles that are equipped with leading technologies .\" Another key factor in the new organization is centralized supply chain management, in which all stages of the supply chain must be seamlessly integrated, from the supplier right through to the end customer. \"We still face great challenges in this field, at the same time there is also huge potential for reducing costs and increasing efficiency,\" explained <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark>. Global production networks bring Mercedes-Benz closer to the different markets and customers and enable it to respond more quickly to changes in demand, because production can be adjusted in individual plants. At the same time, manufacturing in other currency areas enable exchange rate volatility to be evened out. \"Given the expanding range of models, steadily increasing unit figures, and greater complexity than ever before, we have to become significantly more flexible,\" said <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark>. This includes having different variants on the same assembly line, factory equipment being used for several vehicle generations, and working hours that can be varied depending on demand. By standardizing and modularizing its plants, Mercedes-Benz intends to contain the level of capital expenditure needed and reduce fixed costs. \"It is essential that we achieve continuous improvement in all disciplines and raise our productivity,\" added <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark>. The expansion of alliances, establishment of joint ventures, and use of capacity at contract manufacturers play an important role in Mercedes-Benz's growth strategy. At the end of June, Daimler announced that it was setting up a production joint venture with the Renault-Nissan alliance, stepping up their existing cooperation. The partners intend to build a new generation of compact cars at a new factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico, which will have a total annual production capacity of 300,000 units. <mark>Sch\u00e4fer</mark> focuses on transparency and a collaborative working relationship across all hierarchy levels, both in the company as a whole and in his own organization: \"A high-performance organization depends on the motivation of all employees. The human factor makes the difference .\" Goodyear's Georges Feider notes the benefits and challenges of truck tire development live at 4 hours ago 120,000 Porsche cars delivered to customers worldwide 4 hours ago All-new Opel 2.0 CDTI: New generation large diesel debuts in Paris Automotive World is a leading provider of automotive industry information.

the globe and mail in news equal to the recent scientific revelation that ice is actually frozen water, canada and the united states will meet tuesday in the gold-medal game of the women's world hockey championship. it was, of course, never in doubt. canada defeated russia 8-1 monday night in front of 7,255 fans at scotiabank place in a game noteworthy for the fact that the winning goaltender outscored most of her opponents. u.s. advances to women's world hockey final with win over finland hockey russia revelling as team on the rise rachel brady team canada's szabados stands tall against women and men hayley wickenheiser, women's national ice hockey team captain and four-time olympic medallist walks the runway in the heart truth fashion show, part of toronto fashion week in toronto, on thursday, march 21, 2013. hayley wickenheiser walks the runway canadian goaltender shannon szabados picked up an assist on the opening goal when, 19:14 into the opening period, she sent a puck up ice to meaghan mikkelson, who gave it to haley irwin for a shot that bounced before skipping over the outstretched stick of russian goaltender anna prugova. prugova had been brilliant up to that point, stopping 19 of the 20 shots she faced as play was almost totally in the russian end. the canadians, while controlling play, seemed unable to convince the puck to cross the russian goal line. the dam broke early in the second period, however. moments after russia's captain, and best player, yekaterina smolenstseva put a hard shot off szabados's right post, the canadians scored again when natalie spooner was able to squeeze a shot in the short side. canada went up 3-0 when marie-philip poulin backhanded a rebound past prugova and 4-0 on a long blast from just inside the russian blueline by jennifer wakefield, the star of canada's 3-2 shootout victory over the americans in team canada's opening match of the tournament. the russians finally scored just past the game's halfway point when defender svetlana tkachyova took a shot through a screen that eluded szabados. soon, however, goals by jayna hefford and poulin, with her seventh of the tournament, had canada far out in front. third-period goals by meghan agosta-marciano and rebecca johnston - on replacement goaltender yulia leskina - were unnecessary. canada outshot russia 49-18. earlier monday, the united states defeated finland 3-0 to advance to the gold-medal match. the highlight of the game was not the shutout but the play of finnish goaltender jessie vetter, who kept the score respectable compared to the 8-0 drubbing canada had delivered the finns in the opening round. finland and russia will play for the bronze medal earlier in the day. as has been the case in every olympic and world competition, the disparity in competition had become a major issue by the time the medal round began. team sweden, which had showed promise at the turin games in 2006, when it beat the americans in the swedish miracle on ice to meet canada in the gold, showed very poorly in this tournament. the host team had skated with its own controversy since it opened the tournament wearing the black-and-yellow colours of a worthy charity founded by an unworthy, <mark>lance armstrong</mark>, whose name will forever be a euphemism for cheating in sports. after the canadians defeated the swiss 13-0 in a humiliating sacking, they erroneously tried to defend the overkill by claiming switzerland had not started its best goaltender - forgetting, it seemed, that the canadians had blasted an astonishing 79 shots at the two unfortunates who played that night. there are many unwritten rules to the game at all levels, and they range from you never, ever give a butt end to you should never, ever run up the score. there is also much good to be said about the 2013 women's world championship. first and foremost would be the impressive number of young players in the stands - young women who might one day wear the red and white (not the black and yellow of livestrong) of the national team or, for that matter, the colours of other hockey nations. second would be the strides taken by russia, an embarrassing also-ran in previous world championships. the russians did not fare well against the canadians, but they did win other games and impressed with how much they had developed in a year. the competition issue was highlighted in vancouver in 2010, when ioc president jacques rogge said women's hockey would need to become more competitive if it hoped to maintain its position in the winter games. \"it was a little shot from jacques to us,\" international ice hockey federation president rene fasel said monday. the iihf's reaction was to put two million swiss francs (about $2.2-million canadian) into women's hockey development. a mentor program, mostly featuring canadian coaches and players, has been in place for a year. asked if there was a genuine concern that women's hockey could be killed, fasel shrugged and said, \"you never know - they kicked wrestling out .\" but, he added, in his opinion, \"there is no danger .\" fasel pointed out that in the 1928 winter games that the canadian men whipped switzerland by that same 13-0 score that the canadian women beat switzerland this week. it took 78 years, but in turin in 2006, the swiss men beat the canadian 2-0. the question, of course, is will the women be shown such patience? women's world championship young guns step up for canada at world championhsips globe unlimited unparalleled journalism. unflinching insight. unlimited access to canada's #1 newspaper site. disclaimer? copyright 2013 the globe and mail inc. all rights reserved. we've run into a glitch. please try again later."}, {"articleID": "2011051523_00006071_W", "names": {"Ana Rocha": ["Q16490009", "Q46542407", "Q4750486", "Q47786590"]}, "date": "2011-05-15", "url": "http://fox4now.com/story/14649071/host-a-french-student-this-summer", "content": "serving drinks on fort myers beach: can it soon be a reality for all bars? another allegation of police brutality in cape coral connie mack hosts annual military college event lehigh acres students banned from field day confederate license plates could be headed to florida memorial for bicyclist killed on sanibel causeway smoking policy discrimination at bingo hall? fuel prices rise for businesses; cost gets passed along to you confederate license plates could be headed to florida memorial for bicyclist killed on sanibel causeway lehigh acres students banned from field day fort myers man says collier deputies need to be held accountable smoking policy discrimination at bingo hall? how would you like to host a french foreign-exchange student at your house for a few weeks this summer? host families are needed to give room and board to students between the ages of fifteen and seventeen years old. students need a place to stay for three weeks in july, though field trips are scheduled for the students through the exchange program called world exchange. you don't have to have teens at home to apply. organizers say this is a great opportunity for the students to learn the american way of life. \"for most of them it is a dream come true to live in the united states and live with a family and they still want to come to the us in the future and build their lives here,\" world exchange state program director <mark>ana rocha</mark> said. \"i think it's a good experience not only for the kids but for the families too, to get somebody from another country to show them our way of living,\" howard edwards said, with the world exchange. some of the kids have had such a great experience staying with the host families last year they are coming back again this summer. if you'd like more information, contact <mark>ana rocha</mark> 239-689-1876 or 313-3117. her email address is"}]
