Chairman <mark>Sir John</mark> O\u2019Hara QC scrutinised the deaths of five children from the condition last year and heavily criticised a \"cover-up\" by some consultants, accusing some doctors of behaving \"inadequately, evasively, dishonestly and ineptly\". On Tuesday he published an update on the adequacy of searches in 2004 of what were then Western Health Board properties for documents relevant to the probe. <mark>Sir John</mark> identified a failure at leadership level after the whistleblower raised concerns in the public interest. He added: \"However, there was a serious failure to address these concerns, whether to investigate them properly or judge them fairly .\" The wrong conclusions were reached. \"This was a failure at leadership level within the healthcare service .\" Not only was the whistleblower failed but so too was the service. \"He said confidence in the critically important systems of whistleblowing depended upon fairness and professionalism .\" These were absent. It is unsettling to be compelled to this conclusion given the many reassurances urged upon me by senior Health and Social Care Board officials. \"He added:\" Whilst it is for others to determine why this particular whistleblower's concerns were not accorded proper response, I reiterate my recommendation that the highest priority be accorded the development and improvement of leadership skills within the healthcare service. \"The brothers of Raychel Ferguson, who died of hyponatraemia in 2001, (from left) Stephen, Jamie and Jason (Brian Lawless/PA) The High Court judge found three deaths from hyponatraemia, a lack of sodium in the blood, were avoidable and the youngsters received unacceptable care during the administration of intravenous fluids.

The update said:\" That the Western Health and Social Services Board should have failed to conduct appropriate searches, and misled as to the extent of those searches, is profoundly unsatisfactory and is to be criticised. \"The Health and Social Care Board welcomed the fact that no amendment to the\" essential findings \"of <mark>Sir John</mark>'s report as published in January 2018 is required. It acknowledged issues raised in the summary report and accepted there was scope for learning .\" It is also important to stress that the panel members carried out a very complex investigation within a constrained timeline with honesty, integrity and dedication. \"This was done in line with the whistleblowing policy which provides for anonymity of the whistleblower in accordance with relevant legislation .\" The panel members were acutely aware of the seriousness of the whistleblower's concerns, given the tragic circumstances which led to the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, and strived to consider the issues raised in a fair and impartial manner. \"The HSCB is firmly committed to working with the wider healthcare system to ensure that any learning is fully taken on board .\" 0 comment", "articleID": "2019061816_00408990_W", "names": {"Sir John": ["Q28124344", "Q45996744"]}}, {"date": "2019-06-19", "url": "http://newsandstar.co.uk/news/17714665.true-farmers-man-david-thomlinson-is-laid-to-rest/", "content": "News True farmer's man <mark>David</mark> Thomlinson is laid to rest By Maureen Hodges @ DancingSheep1 Farming and Rural Affairs Editor See photos images Skip to next photo 1 / 1 Show caption 1 / 1 0 comment IT WAS a poignant moment as hundreds of people gathered at a Carlisle mart to pay their respects to a giant in the livestock auctioneering world. Farmers, livestock breeders and business leaders' from all corners of the UK had gathered not for the usual hustle and bustle of a busy livestock mart sale day, but to pay their respects to <mark>David</mark> Thomlinson. His funeral was being live streamed on a giant screen in the Borderway Auction Mart at Rosehill, where he had spent 57 years of his working life. Anecdotes were exchanged about a man they counted as a friend and mentor, who liked nothing better than standing in the rostrum and selling anything presented in front of him - with the challenge of achieving the best price. A hush descended as mourners were asked to stand while on the screen an image appeared of <mark>David</mark>'s coffin being carried into the tiny Scaleby Church where he had been a regular worshipper. Warm tributes have flooded in from all over the globe for <mark>David</mark>, one of the best-known auctioneers of his generation, after he passed away two weeks ago following a tragic accident on the family farm at Scaleby.

The decision to webcast <mark>David</mark>'s service at the mart and Scaleby Village Hall was taken by family and colleagues at Harrison & Hetherington after it was realised the tiny village could not cope with the numbers of mourners, which tallied more than 1,000. The service was led by Reverend Elizabeth Gough, who said perhaps it was no coincidence that she, a farmer's daughter, should lead <mark>David</mark>'s service. Then a tiny ripple of laughter went through the watching crowd as Rev Gough added there was a chaplain standing by \"just in case technology fails'. In a tribute to the auctioneer's early life, Rev Gough said it would have been <mark>David</mark> and wife Sheila's 49th wedding anniversary. The couple met back in the sixties at the Cosmo in Carlisle, when Sheila, a farmer's daughter from Yorkshire who was then living in Annan, caught his eye. The couple moved to Park View, <mark>David</mark>'s parents' farm in 1988 .\" Sheila mentions that <mark>David</mark> said, \"when you get to Scaleby and got clay on your clogs you never moved',\" said Rev Gough. \"He loved his dogs Tink and Pip, who miss him, and was proud of the many young auctioneers he had mentored. I hope you've only picked up his good habits and ensure his legacy lives on through future generations .\" Ask yourself what would <mark>David</mark>, or DT or Tommo as I know some of you called him say or do. \"H & H joint managing director, <mark>David Pritchard</mark> said <mark>David</mark> was also a livestock breeder, an acclaimed and valued judge of livestock and an inspiration character for the younger generations he had mentored through their early days .\" <mark>David</mark> could tell you many a story in his early days in the office, and not all of it was work - playing cards was one of them, antics with the office bike to name but a few. \"I remember him telling me the first item he sold was a child's cot for one shilling.
