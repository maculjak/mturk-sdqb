ventricle goes bad posted on: tuesday, 16 february 2010, 14:36 cst new research from the university of alabama at birmingham (uab) suggests that the ability of right side of the heart to pump blood may be an indication of the risk of death to heart-failure patients whose condition is caused by low function by the left side of their heart. the ability of the two chambers of the heart, the left and right ventricles, to pump blood is described as ejection fraction. healthy individuals typically have ejection fractions between 50 and 65 percent in both chambers. in findings reported in january in circulation, a journal of the american heart association, researchers at uab say that low right-ventricular ejection fraction (rvef) increased the risk of death in patients with systolic heart failure - heart failure associated with low left-ventricular ejection fraction. \"the role of the right ventricle in chronic systolic heart failure has been overlooked for many years, in part because it was considered to be merely a passive chamber,\" said <mark>ali ahmed</mark>, m.d, mph., associate professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular disease and the senior author of the study. \"studies of the effect of rvef on outcomes in heart failure have been limited by small sample size and short follow-up .\" using data from 2,008 patients with advanced chronic systolic heart failure in the beta-blocker evaluation of survival trial sponsored by the national heart, lung and blood institute, one of the national institutes of health, the uab team discovered that death rates went up as rvef went down. patients with a rvef of greater than 40 percent had a death rate of 27 percent during the two-year study. but when the rvef dropped to less than 20 percent, the death rate increased to nearly half, or 47 percent, of the patients. \"our study suggest that rvef is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with heart failure and should be routinely measured to better identify these at-risk patients and provide appropriate therapy for them,\" said <mark>ahmed</mark>. \"future studies need to determine the risk factors for rvef impairment and to develop and test interventions that may improve outcomes in heart failure patients with low rvef .\" popular diabetes drugs linked to increased risk of heart failure and death kidney function decline increases risk of

the dothan city commission's work session tuesday didn't lead to any firm decisions about which non-profit organizations the city should support, because the commissioners agreed the current policy for deciding such matters needs to be examined. each of the commissioners expressed some concern about city commission policy no. 16, which sets the conditions nonprofit groups must meet in order to receive funding from the city. as a result, the commissioners agreed to examine 20 questions laid out in a report by the city's internal analyst, valerie harris, based on existing nonprofit funding policies in other communities across the state. \"let's take these 20 questions, take a look at all the information we have, and come to some conclusions,\" mayor mike schmitz told the commission. \"i want us to really study this issue and these questions .\" the commissioners will report back to the mayor with their responses to the questions in two weeks, at which time they can begin work on a new policy. district 1 commissioner james reading was the first to raise concerns about the existing policy during the meeting, citing confusion about how much power the commission actually has regarding allocation of funds. \"i have some problems with the way policy 16 is written,\" he said. \"let's look at what this commission is responsible for, which should be everything, and what the city manager is responsible for .\" according to district 6 commissioner keith seagle, the commission's primary concern is accountability for the agencies receiving funding. harris' report laid out some common practices among other communities statewide that seagle would like to see implemented in dothan. \"there are some basic rules as far as being fair and competitive, such as making an application process and demonstrating that you are doing with the people's money what you said you'd do with the people's money,\" seagle said. during the meeting, dothan finance director <mark>angela

"one almost feels sorry for director joe johnston, who parlayed his work as an art director on the original \"star wars\" trilogy into increased budgets and respect as a director of family-oriented movies. the wolfman': hollywood horror classic reduced to shaggy dog story in remake by william kerns | a-j entertainment editor story last updated at 2/19/2010 - 12:10 am one almost feels sorry for director joe johnston, who parlayed his work as an art director on the original \"star wars\" trilogy into increased budgets and respect as a director of family-oriented movies. his attempt to remake george waggner's 1941 \"wolf man\" is little more than an ineffective overdose of cgi effects, gore and body parts, none of which are frightening. the shame is that johnston had so skillfully avoided r-rated products to this point. he made studios money with 1995's \"jumanji\" and \"jurassic park iii\" in 2001. and his best efforts are 1991's \"the rocketeer\" and the critically acclaimed \"october sky\" in 1999. all shine when compared to this new horror film. but then, who could blame johnston for jumping at the offer, especially with universal pictures ready to hand him a $100 million budget? unfortunately, \"the wolfman\" appears to have eaten up a half decade of his life, with little positive to show for it. indeed, the film is never clever or scary. those hoping to see a nightmarish \"wolfman\" most likely will just leave bored. to johnston's credit, even the studio's revolving release dates between 2007 and 2010 did not stop him from at least attempting to stress atmosphere and mood over pacing and blood. his fog machines never lost power, giving one the impression that things have been wrong for quite some time at talbot hall. mere candlelight is strong enough to reveal <mark>sir john</mark> talbot (anthony hopkins) taking no notice of cobwebs hanging from the staircase. the family has issues. that much becomes clear even before benicio del toro's lawrence talbot reveals affection for his late brother's wife, and recalls how his father committed him to life inside an asylum for a year as a child. a return to that asylum provides medicinal torture, only serving to make one look forward to martin scorsese's \"shutter island .\" more than once, hopkins welcomes del toro home as a \"prodigal son,\" but this is hardly preparation for the ridiculous departure taken by the screenwriters in the film's final conflict. production design and danny elfman's music score are proof that johnston at least put some thought into homage as much as horror. opening subtlety is lost quickly. there is no mystery, in fact, not when hopkins spends years locking himself behind bars in the family crypt during years of full moons. performances are disappointing overall. the villagers' combination of fear and superstition is well acted, but hopkins mails in his own performance and del toro cannot drum up enough believable passion even during his most important transformation. emily blunt is forgettable as the woman who attracts the love of two brothers. faring only somewhat better is hugo weaving as the scotland yard officer who actually

581-3571 orono - an exhaustive year-long study of economic, safety and environmental issues related to clearing maine's roads has yielded a report from the university of maine's margaret chase smith policy center. the report, developed in cooperation with the maine department of transportation (mainedot), involved university experts in economics, engineering, public administration and environmental sciences. it shows improvements in managing winter storm transportation issues over the past decade and recommends a series of steps aimed at reducing costs, limiting the negative environmental impact of chloride-based chemicals and improving public safety. prof. jonathan rubin of the umaine school of economics and margaret chase smith policy center is the report's lead author. he says that the implications for long-term state and municipal planning are significant. \"because of its rural nature and vast territory, maine must address some particularly difficult issues when dealing with transportation during the winter months,\" rubin says. \"by bringing together stakeholder groups and carefully examining available data, we've determined that our state and municipalities do an excellent job managing these issues and we've developed a road map for even more effective processes and procedures in the future .\" some of the report's key findings: \u2022 in the aggregate, maine spends an estimated $98 million annually on winter road snow and ice control ($76 per resident); this includes some sidewalks and school parking lots and funding sources include the state, municipalities and the maine turnpike authority \u2022 the estimated 490,000 pounds of rock salt purchased in maine during 2008-2009 represent 750 pounds per resident or 21 tons per road mile \u2022 maine has 23,450 miles of public road, the most in new england; mainedot maintains 18 percent of that total \u2022 all chloride salts contribute to vehicle and infrastructure corrosion; none is shown to cause more corrosion than another \u2022 between 1989 and 2008, there has been a significant reduction on the number of fatalities on state highways; at the same time, the number of vehicle miles traveled in maine has been increasing (except during the past two years) \u2022 drivers ages 16 and 17 are involved in nine percent more winter-condition crashes than their share of crashes under other road conditions; drivers ages 18-34 are also involved in more winter crashes, but not to the degree of 16 - and 17-year-olds \u2022 long-term environmental effects of road chemicals are apparent along maine roadways; new policies are needed to encourage the use of chemicals and technologies with less environmental impact the report notes that chloride salts are currently the best and most affordable tool maine has to use for winter road maintenance but that they take a toll on the environment, infrastructure and vehicles. while the variability of conditions around maine makes it impossible to apply one solution in all instances, the report says that there are \"advances in technology and practice which can lead to reduced costs and reduced salt use .\" one recommended focus area relates to a move from deicing to anti-icing. the former involves spreading sand and salt after snow has accumulated, the latter is a preventative process currently used effectively by mainedot, the maine turnpike authority and some maine municipalities. \"anti-icing and pre-wetting policies,\" the report says, \"have been shown to result in reduced plowing time, a reduction in abrasives us, a decrease in total chemical use, and decreased maintenance costs .\" those processes can help the state address cost issues, corrosion and environmental impact. in addition to its key findings, the report contains a series of goals that the state and municipalities should address: \u2022 maintain safety while reducing salt and sand use \u2022 identify efficiencies to maximize the budgetary impact of improvements \u2022 reduce salt use \u2022 increase public awareness of preventative measures \u2022 increase driver safety education \u2022 increase public awareness of winter practices, costs and environmental impact rubin also notes that the study involved an extensive review of current practices in other northern states and in canadian provinces. here. the university of maine,

presidential run, laid out a vision of smaller government and a strong defense before a crucial conservative constituency friday. the other principle he said guides him: \"god's in charge .\" \"if it's good enough for the founding fathers it should be good enough for each and every one of us,\" said pawlenty, noting that god is enshrined in the country's founding documents. the republican governor, who was raised catholic but now attends an evangelical church, is not known for wearing religion on his sleeve. he noted that some people said it would be \"politically incorrect\" to bring up god. \"hogwash,\" pawlenty said, drawing applause. it was a fitting pitch for his audience. in the speech to thousands of activists and leaders gathered at the annual conservative political action conference, pawlenty sought to introduce himself, outline an agenda, and show he's a credible challenger to other republicans considered more formidable in the hunt for the gop presidential nomination, particularly mitt romney. the former massachusetts governor who lost his 2008 republican primary bid made a splash at the conference one day earlier. romney brought along his state's new republican senator <mark>scott brown</mark> to introduce him. his previous campaign trail experience coming through, romney delivered an impassioned defense of conservatism and indictment of president barack obama's first year to a cheering and chanting crowd. it was standing-room only for his mid-afternoon speech. his would-be campaign staff was on hand. later friday, indiana rep. mike pence, who also is said to be eying a white house bid but isn't believedto be nearly as far along in the planning, delivered a robust speech filled with criticism of obama and lines tailor-made for this partisan crowd. \"the job of the american president is not to manage american decline. the job of the american president is to reverse it,\" pence said at one point, earning thundering cheers. by contrast, the reception for pawlenty's midmorning speech was more muted. he received a standing ovation and polite applause. the ballroom was just partially filled; there were empty seats throughout, though that could have been because of the hour. he, too, had aides nearby who are helping him lay the groundwork for a possible run. pawlenty sought to draw a stylistic contrast from romney, who spoke from prepared remarks on a teleprompter. aides said pawlenty spoke more extemporaneously, drawing from bullet points written in a notebook on the lectern. his speech was part conservative pep talk, part criticism of obama. noting that tiger woods was in the headlines again friday, pawlenty said the gop should take a page from the playbook of the golfer's wife and declared: \"we should take a 9-iron and smash the window out of big government in this country .\" he belittled obama as a president of \"hope and change and teleprompters .\" he also said: \"if government spending were an olympic sport, he would be a repeat gold medalist .\" and he said: \"mr. president, no more apology tours and no more giving miranda rights to terrorists in our country .\" pawlenty also delivered a message

doctors they expect the 86-year-old to make a full recovery. dr. <mark>james holland</mark> of new york city's mount sinai medical center said the five-term democrat will undergo chemotherapy treatments. \"we expect a full and complete recovery for senator lautenberg. the senator will be treated with chemotherapy administered approximately every three weeks. we anticipate that he will receive between six and eight treatments, and in between treatments, the senator is expected to be back at work in the senate,\" dr. <mark>holland</mark> said. lautenberg began his treatment friday afternoon. \"i wouldn't be too surprised to soon hear how he's once again outpacing younger aides as they walk through u.s. capitol building,\" said state assembly speaker sheila y. oliver, a democrat. lautenberg told the star-ledger of newark late friday that he was \"feeling very good .\" lautenberg said he intends to return to washington to complete his term. \"my contract goes to 2014,\" he said. in the event that lautenberg, the second-oldest u.s. senator, is unable to serve, republican gov. chris christie has the option of naming a replacement, calling for a special election, or leaving the seat vacant until the next regular election. however, in the state's political circles friday, there wasn't open talk of a lautenberg resignation. politicians of both parties wished him a quick recovery. \"i'm encouraged by the positive statements of his doctors, and i am confident that frank will be back in the senate fighting for new jersey soon,\" said senate majority leader <mark>harry reid</mark>, d-nev. u.s. sen. robert menendez, also a democrat, called lautenberg \"new jersey tough .\" \"my thoughts and prayers are with sen. lautenberg,\" he said, \"and i look forward to fighting for new jersey families together with him for years to come .\" assemblyman jay webber, chairman of new jersey's republican state committee, said it's \"inappropriate\" to talk about filling the seat should lautenberg be unable to finish his term. <mark>patrick murray</mark>, a monmouth university political scientist, said a lautenberg resignation would mean that new jersey would have its first republican senator since nicholas f. brady served for eight months after being appointed to fill a vacancy. lautenberg replaced him. the state hasn't elected a republican u.s. senator since 1976. \"three of the four elected statewide offices in new jersey would be held by republicans, which would be an oddity,\" said <mark>murray</mark>, who doesn't think lautenberg would resign unless he had to. university of virginia political scientist larry sabato said another republican in the senate would make it harder for democrats to get the 60 votes they need to block a filibuster. there are now 59 democrats in the senate. \"it's that much harder to get two republican defections instead of one,\" he said. the liberal lautenberg, born in paterson, became prominent as a founder of the payroll services company automatic data processing long before he entered politics in 1982 with a successful run for the u.s. senate. he retired from politics and did not seek re-election in 2000, but returned two years later as a last-minute replacement in a senate race when sen. robert torricelli dropped out. he was re-elected in 2008, winning easily in a race in which
