\"leaving eden\" album review: carolina chocolate drops - \"leaving eden\" foot-tapping ensues right out of the barn on the carolina chocolate drops sophomore effort, as the thunder-picking melody of a 5-string banjo collides with a fiddle moan going rounds with a primitive yet wildly syncopated fife-and-drum beat in \"riro's house .\" it doesn't take long to realize there's something important about that galloping banjo (several models appear on the album: 5-string, 4-string, 5-string cello banjo, and a 5-string \"gourd\" ), an instrument with roots in african-american traditional music, and more specifically, africans in colonial america. it's been said the carolina chocolate drops are among the only-if not the only-black traditional string band this side of, well, anywhere. it's fair to say founding members rhiannon giddens and dom flemons have knocked hard on the doors of their past. for leaving eden, the follow-up to 2010's grammy winning genuine negro jig, the group enlisted nashville producer buddy miller (emmylou harris, solomon burke, <mark>robert plant</mark>), beat-boxer adam matta, brooklyn guitarist / banjoist hubby jenkins, and cellist leyla mccalla to expand upon these firm roots. the piedmont multi-instrumentalists may be of a vanishing breed who call and respond to their ancestors, arranging classics like \"briggs' corn shucking jig,\" dating as far back as 1855. but the ccd spirit reflected in today's world is unmistakable in original tunes like \"country girl\" - written by giddens as an ode to her north carolina stomping grounds-or by reinventing classic selections of their string-playing mentors. the group's self-proclaimed \"modern take on traditional sound\" is eclectic and exciting: each arrangement is nuanced and interesting vocally, instrumentally and lyrically-from the a cappella chain-gang vibe of \"read 'em john,\" to the unique use of jugs, quills and bones. vocals are split diversely between the magnificent, bluesy songbird giddens and her spitfire counterpart flemons, not to mention matta's instrumental bass vocal talents. casual listeners may not discern that the underlying hip-hoppin' bass line in \"ruby (are you mad at your man?)\" is a human voice - that's right, matta lays down the low end with his voice on several tracks. guitar purists might notice audible rhythm and acoustic fingerpicking here and there, but its absence is the true indication to the heart of this sound. the banjo is to this style of roots music what the electric guitar is to modern rock. fiddle and mandolin paired with acoustic guitar are power-string combos in most bluegrass and folk groups, but the carolina chocolate drops make a powerful case for straight-up banjo with anything. the drops are stylists, but rare are those who can simultaneously hold up a genre while innovating within it. this is where the \"old meets new\" magic happens and the hootenanny spills into the town square, revealing southern string music for then and now, oozing with soul and interpreted authentically right down to the last drop. all comments are subject to editing or deletion by the premier guitar staff. p #319-447-5550 / 877-704-4327 copyright? 2011 all rights reserved", "articleID": "2012040615_00072156_W", "names": {"Robert Plant": ["Q28036733", "Q428223", "Q58449717"]}}, {"date": "2012-04-09", "url": "http://loansafe.org/experts-to-debate-affordable-housing", "content": "(mct) - jeddah: lack of supply of affordable homes is a concern in the middle east as a whole and no more so than saudi arabia. according to various studies and analysis, the discrepancy between supply and demand of housing units in saudi arabia is significant. such huge demand for new residential properties in saudi arabia has led to the establishment of the ministry of housing in 2011. cityscapeconnect business breakfasts is a platform that provides real estate investors and developers with an opportunity to network while gaining valuable market insight from a panel of real estate experts. notable speakers at the cityscapeconnect business breakfasts in alkhobar and jeddah will address the kingdom's affordable housing debate and tackle the home buyers' expectation on affordable housing among other discussions. they are taking place at the m? venpick hotel in alkhobar on sunday and the jeddah hilton on monday. commenting on the market's lack of sufficient affordable housing, abdulaziz al-shaibani ceo of al-oula, said: \"the government's strategy is dependent on private developers' willingness and capability to provide affordable housing. on the other hand, significant challenges still remain in the local markets, to make affordable housing feasible due to the huge demand gap that is outstripping supply, in addition to legislative obstacles. however, given the fundamental demand driver, there should be significant opportunities for investors and developers to achieve sizable returns. as for the real estate market in general, strong population growth continued economic development and diversification are set to ensure robust demand for all types of real estate over the coming decade .\" commenting on the housing needs of the eastern province, jenan's md and ceo bassam boodai, said: \"it is expected that the eastern province will require around 150,000 housing units by 2014, which is the highest demand in the kingdom .\" looking at the overall picture he went on to say: \"according to the central department of statistics and information, saudi arabia's population is growing at a rate of 3.2 percent and with about 60 percent of saudi population under the age of 30 the private and public sector needs to take serious action to cater for the ever increasing demand. the government has already taken decisive action to tackle the problem by injecting sr 250 billion into affordable housing and now it's up to the private sector to accommodate the demand. a collaboration between the private sector and the government will be the most effective approach to meet the increasing demand in a record time .\" saudi arabia has traditionally been a country where home construction or purchase was self-financed, with family and personal savings being the major driver of property financing. this is starting to change as progress is being made in mortgage financing and new regulations for off-plan financing. bank financing is still relatively limited and out of reach for a significant proportion of the population. real estate and construction loans accounted for 7.1 percent of total bank credit in 2010 while home loans were only 2.8 percent of total bank credits. this is very low in comparison to other gcc countries. \"the kingdom's real estate sector is now maturing as it begins to fulfill the high expectations of investors. the cityscapeconnect business breakfasts serve as a prelude to the annual cityscape jeddah event in june 2012 with its unique portfolio of exhibition and summits which is in line with the government's vision for growth in the real estate industry,\" said deep marwaha, group director of cityscape. \"in addition to affordability in the residential market, the business breakfasts will cover the need for innovative financing models to secure the funds for project development in the current climate, profitability structures for public-private partnership models, and the cost of land for developing affordable housing projects in attractive locations .\" key panelists at the alkhobar business breakfast are boodai; khalid m. telmesani, md and ceo of sumou real estate; and al-shaibani, while the jeddah event includes experts such as gagan suri, vp, head of real estate, asset management at ncb capital: <mark>martin cooper</mark>, director and head of advisory -
