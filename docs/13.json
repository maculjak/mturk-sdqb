i saw sam mendes running up and down the aisles filming the show, and i was hoping that it was this one that was to be released...and it was the whole point of the show to recreate judy's carnegie album...still, both shows were brilliant so it'll all be fantastic as per rufus' usual...to non uk/irish fans...the palladium show was shown on channel 4 recently...i missed it though as i was on holiday...doh! roll on 10th october when i get to see mr w up close again in dublin...faaaaantaaaaastic! if the clip of \"san fransisco\" on youtube is any indication it was a fabulous show and will be equally wonderful on dvd! i can't wait for 1st feb next year for rufus' show in melbourne, but this will help satisfy me for a while! will these be released in australia? or at least will the dvd be multi-region/regionless? i was wondering when something of that sort would come out i can't wait! i almost cried in milwaukee when he did get happy! i said at that moment i was the happiest girl in the world...i love judy garland. i love rufus wainwright. my soul may explode from the beauty of it all! hurray!!! i'm so thrilled! guess what i'm getting as an early christmas present? i'm going to go preorder it right now! i have totally enjoyed his want dvd so am really looking forward to this one! great news - you can see the blog i posted after seeing you in london last month below - unfortunately the photos i took can't be copied here due to html code being disabled. the gay messiah question, - what is the difference between a good and a great concert? for me, a good concert is hearing one of your favourite artistes singing their songs, a great concert is feeling that you've spent 2.5 hours in their company and got to know a bit more about that artist and how they tick, or what their sense of humour is like. rufus wainwright is like a male version of cyndi lauper, in so much as he doesn't shut up when you see him live, he talks between almost every song and he oozes star quality and he is damn funny too. from the moment he bounces on stage and announces in his strong american accent that its \"good to be home\" the audience is in the palm of his hand. he obviously loves london, he tells us how he wants to move here but its too expensive, and he'd need to be a really, really big star and sell thousands and thousands of records to buy a house here, but us coming to see him in concert is one small step in helping him to achieve that goal. he's been touring around the uk for the last month and he says, as good as the audiences have been, he has felt like a big fish in a little town and most people were only there because there wasn't anything else on in town that night to see, in london there's so much happening that he's touched we've come to see him. (these are his words before i get angry comments from the midlands, bronte country or the moors) the show is in two halves, in the first half (stars & stripes outfit - i have pics i'll be adding later) he does nearly all the songs from his latest album, release the stars including tulsa, & sanssouci - plus the art teacher & the song that got me interested in him in the first place cigarettes & chocolate milk (its about the best things being bad for us) this was rufus' introduction to sanssouci, it is a palace in germany built for crown prince frederick, look him up on wikipedia, he ain't pretty - frederick had two rules for sanssouci, it was to be a men only palace and none of the doors were to have locks on them, so that the prince could walk in on his guests as he pleased and order them to do...well, the possibilities are endless really. he introduced tiergarten a beautiful song he'd written about his german boyfriend thus - german rolling stone magazine had an article about musicians and their muses and number one was <mark>john lennon</mark> & <mark>yoko ono</mark>, two was mick jagger & marianne faithful, then at number nine, rufus wainwright and my german boyfriend - the lucky bastard. germany so hard to love, and we hate to love it, its true. on the record between my legs has guest spoken vocals from <mark>sian phillips</mark>, on the tour fans have been asked to submit clips of themselves doing the spoken section to you tube (or was it x tube?) and the best one from each town gets to perform the song on stage with rufus, or as more often is the case, the only entrant from each town. part two of the show had more german references with rufus kitted out in lederhosen (think they're actually from austria) but its very sound of music, part two culminates with ginger dave's fave rufus song 14th street (did think of you dave when it played). rufus then came back in a white toweling dressing gown for an encore of poses before removing the gown to reveal fishnet tights, he proceeded to put on some lippy and high heels for a fabulous and totally camp rendition of judy garland's get happy complete with male dancers [this song alone made it worthwhile for grumpy to have travelled down from birmingham just for the night] before the last song the gay messiah which has one of the best opening lines ever in my opinion, \"he will be re-born, from 1970's porn\" he is a master showman and doesn't just sing his songs, he performs them. he's at hammersmith again tonight and said tomorrow's show will be even better, tonight has been great but the second show is always better - i'm very tempted to find out if that is true. currently listening: want by rufus wainwright waiting for december 4!! also waiting for the sam mendes flick...what's up wuth that one? just going to sit back and let the music make me smile...you're the best, rufus! good luck with the rest of your tour...please come to florida! okay i love rufus and all but i'm starting to wonder if i'll ever be able to relate to his music the way i did with his first couple of albums. as far as this release, i'm not over 60 and i'm not a gay man so i don't appreciate judy the way so many others apparently do. ya she was into gay men - we get it. so now she's an icon/cliche and celebrate the fact she was a negligent mother and serious drug abuser (even if it was pushed on her at first). i still think rufus is a genius but i wish, just once, he would do something a little more mainstream. he's the kind of musician who can do mainstream his own unique way without selling out and fans, both old and new would reward him unlike never before. so even though i love rufus i'm not going to purchase something i know i won't be in to. best of luck with the sales though...i saw you perform this live, you are fabu the show was a riot, you make my heart sing! i'm going to buy it today!!!!!!", "articleID": "2009022519_00055923_W", "names": {"John Lennon": ["Q11979004", "Q6244563"], "Sian Phillips": ["Q23696704", "Q237778"], "Yoko Ono": ["Q11464149", "Q117012", "Q16264827"]}}, {"date": "2009-02-27", "url": "http://ksl.com/?nid=156&sid=5703692", "content": "on the net: sites aim to be tv guide for the web by jake coyle ap entertainment writer (ap) - you've seen will ferrell's \"landlady .\" you know what hulu is. but that much hyped 21st century invention called the web series remains largely unknown to you. fear not. a host of web sites can direct you to the best series online, including tilzy.tv and tubefilter.tv _ both good blogs that feature knowledgeable seekers of worthy web series. it's a thriving business. the broader online video guide ovguide.com, founded in 2006, earlier this month announced it had received $5 million from venture capital firm baroda ventures after the site's first month of profitability in january. the site eguiders.com began last week, touting itself as the \"tv guide of the web .\" the way it distinguishes itself is primarily through its hollywood guest editors. among them: damon lindelof, co-creator of \"lost\" ; jerry stiller and anne meara; actor willie garson (\"sex and the city\" ); and shawn ryan, the executive producer of \"the shield .\" it's a similar approach of recommendations from well-known personalities like you see on will ferrell and <mark>adam mckay</mark>'s funnyordie.com _ albeit with a wider purview. the site was founded by marc ostrick, who has done web series for tv shows such as fox's \"24\" and hbo's \"john from cincinnati,\" and his partner evangeline morphos, a theater professor at columbia university. after ostrick mentioned the difficulty he had both distributing video content and finding it online, morphos noted that tv had had a similar period of programming confusion before the birth of tv guide in 1953 _ which pooled the resources of several earlier regional guides. \"the greatest problem with content on the internet is people have a hard time knowing where to go to find it,\" says ostrick. \"there's just so much stuff out there .\" david milch, the creator of \"nypd blue\" and \"deadwood,\" is a principal adviser to eguiders. ostrick and milch collaborated on a web component for milch's \"john from cincinnati,\" the confusing drama that was canceled after one season. ostrick says _ and this may further confuse fans _ that the show was ultimately about the internet and whether it might be possible to humanize the internet. milch has said eguiders is \"a good start\" toward this goal. part of the idea is to appeal to older users who might not know their way around the internet well. the 81-year-old stiller is very much in that category. \"i'm also involved with the facespace now. i've picked up a couple of people,\" says stiller, accidentally fusing facebook with myspace. \"facespace? it's facebook,\" corrects meara, his longtime comedy partner and (far more computer literate) wife. (\"seinfeld\" fans, though, might recall the brief computer scheme hatched by stiller's character, frank costanza, after he saw sandra bullock in \"a provocative movie on cable tv; it was called\" the net' with the girl from \"the bus .'\" ) \"i'm on the computer more than jerry and i get a kick out of stuff i see on youtube and hulu,\" says meara, whose responsible for most of the picks by the couple, including \"faux baby\" and the excellent \"jeannie tate show .\" there is some bias, though. stiller also picked a video created by son ben for the film \"tropic thunder .\" he calls it \"impromptu comedic mayhem\" on the site, but explains himself: \"i'm speaking as the dad here, papa jerry .\" \"i guess it's bringing me closer to cyberspace in some way,\" says stiller. \"i can't

different from being 1 to being 51 as far as looking up to one's siblings. our parents teach and guide us through childhood with the consistent feeling of protection and safety that only a parent can provide in a hug or in the explanation of why solider ants won't eat you. from my father i learned to think with both sides of my brain, which helped me to solve a problem mathematically and then write a sonnet or poem to complement it, from my mother i learned the history of paintings and artists, through books and museums, paintings, sculptures & books. to not only see color and shapes but to see their movement and feel them as they are in nature in 3 dimensional layers, how to study faces & things and then draw them as i saw them. as siblings, we teach and guide each other without realizing it at the time of the lesson which becomes crucial knowledge that is used again and again through out our life time without conscious thought of where the knowledge originated from, like a family heirloom that we temporarily forgot who gave it to us. from lance i learned the importance of a different vantage point when he put me on his shoulders to see in a big mirror how to learn by just being still and listening to a room full of people and to hear the quiet voice inside that keeps us from danger, to find strength & answers in nature; solace in creativity & music. from denise i learned the art of matching stripes & plaids in sewing, how to bake breads & cookies that keep people dropping by for more. how to preserve special memories in journaling and leave out inapplicable, the patience of sharing with in a family & how to play with children, the importance in letting go of past hurts to make room for happier memories from marc i learned team work and strategy in playing

sports can make you rich. they can make you famous. they will most certainly make you hurt and they might even make you dead. the college recruiters, player agents and the public know all about the first but hardly anyone is eager to mention that last bit. every professional team's season highlight video has pictures of happy, healthy athletes, dancing girls and touchdowns, goals and winner's circle celebrations. rarely is the public reminded of the cost--one that can be counted in blood, broken bones and lost dreams. in fact, many of the players don't even understand the ravages that sport can inflict on their bodies. and, even if they do, it's not as if it would suddenly make anyone decide to give up being a quarterback or nascar driver to take up an exciting career in bookkeeping. the center for disease control and prevention estimates that about 300,000 sports-related concussions are suffered each year in the u.s. the average elite athlete will die by age 67, considerably lower than the 76-year life expectancy of the average american. according to the nfl players' association, the average life expectancy of an nfl player is 58 years. \"there's a dramatic difference from the rest of society,\" says stu laird, president of the canadian football league players' association. \"there are some insurance carriers who won't insure them past 51. i've heard figures anywhere from 55 to 59...it's quite dramatic. i wouldn't imagine the cfl to be a lot different in that regard .\" soccer leagues in europe are doing studies that show significant brain damage in players from mid-air collisions and from striking balls with their heads. hockey recently saw the death of don sanderson, a senior player with the whitby dunlops. that is an isolated incident. but serious injuries are not--an nhl player will suffer on average three injuries a season. that can be anything from bruises and lost teeth to herniated discs and concussions. laird understands the dangers and the sacrifices athletes make physically, personally and emotionally. and with team salary caps of $4.2 million for a 40-man cfl roster, nobody is getting rich. the average nfl and cfl career is less than four seasons. but as a 13-year veteran who retired in 1996, laird also understands why <mark>young</mark> athletes will challenge those odds. \"when you're 20, you feel bullet-proof. retirement? getting old? that's 30 years down the road...you don't think that far ahead. i know i wouldn't have given it up for the world. we were having such a good time .\" and, the good times do roll. \"it's glamorous. no doubt a unique lifestyle,\" says toronto maple leafs player development coach paul <mark>dennis</mark>, of the pro lifestyle. \"guys go from making $65-a-week riding the buses from regina to seattle to earning hundreds of thousands of dollars .\" but there is also the reality of eric lindros lying in a crumpled heap with the fairies dancing in his brain. some, such as race-car drivers gilles villeneuve, <mark>greg moore</mark> and dale earnhardt, pay the ultimate price in deadly crashes. jockey avelino gomez's brilliant career ended with a deadly fall at the 1980 canadian oaks. then there are the after-shocks. there is the reality of former cfl lineman <mark>david boone</mark>, found dead on the deck of his home of an apparent suicide. <mark>boone</mark>, who won five grey cup rings with edmonton, suffered from chronic pain and depression believed to have been brought on by haunting football injuries. teammate york hentschel died of organ failure at age 52. another teammate, <mark>bill stevenson</mark>, couldn't escape the bottle. last year, b.c. lions' terry bates broke two vertebrae in his neck and then discovered that the league allowed teams to release injured players and cut their benefits at $60,000 before the next season's training camp. the league's disability plan leaves a bit to be desired. the players hope to improve it in future negotiations with the owners but economics, as always, restricts what the league can do. but money does not heal all wounds. in the nfl, a neuropathologist found that concussions andre waters sustained playing football led to his depression and suicide. former pittsburgh lineman justin strzelczyk was killed in a high-speed police chase. a post-mortem showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which causes depression and dementia and is usually found in people more than 80 years old. strzelczyk was 36. \"the elite athlete grows up believing he is invincible,\" says sports agent boblamonte. he is also an educator and on the board at new york university. \"they've grown up being the strongest, the best. that invincibility doesn't allow them to see the forest for the trees. you're indestructible. even if they're shown otherwise, they don't see it. it's the classic\" you're not talking about me' syndrome. it's you, and me, and bob, we go into pro sport and we were great in junior high, great in high school, we were great in college and now we're in the pros and it's never going to end. we're the greatest that ever was. \"the adulation, the money and the excitement of pro sports can be intoxicating. today, glenn healy is director of players affairs for the nhl players' association but there is a certain boyish charm to the excitement that comes into his voice when he recalls the 1994 playoffs .\" the challenge, that rush you feel when you're trying to win a championship; i still remember how we felt with the rangers when we stepped on the ice with one game to win in game 7. where are you going to get that? you find me the office anywhere that can match the rush of that experience. you can't. \"it is a high that cannot be diminished by psycho-babble or medical statistics .\" even today, i still miss playing, \"says laird, and he hasn't strapped on the pads in 13 autumns .\" if you look at other sports, baseball, hockey, volleyball, basketball, you can still play the game at a recreational level for a long, long time. but when football is over, you're done. the game just leaves you. there are very few opportunities to stay involved. \"so dallas cowboys quarterback troy aikman hung on through 10 concussions before retiring. san francisco quarterback <mark>steve young</mark> suffered four concussions in three years before he stepped down. in the nhl, mike richter retired only after doctors told him one more concussion might leave him with a lifetime of headaches .\" the game beats you up. you typically don't leave healthy, whether it's a knee, an ankle, a hip. we're like timebombs. we feel good at 35, \"healy says,\" but i'm starting to see guys now who have had hips replaced, knees replaced. you just abuse your body and play when you shouldn't. \"look at <mark>pat quinn</mark>, ken dryden, <mark>colin campbell</mark>, steve yzerman--all had post-career operations. a lot of guys get things done .\" boxing and soccer players are susceptible to many of the same types of injuries. even women's hockey isn't immune. in a study of ncaa sports, women's hockey players were twice as likely to suffer a concussion than their male counterparts. it is the most dangerous female sport, on par with men's soccer. but none compare with pro football. \"in many cases the players are their own worst enemies,\" laird says, \"in the sense that they want to play...to help the team. you don't want to be the person to let down the team and you'll push yourself to extremes. it's such a macho sport...we have to educate people that there could be long-term consequences .\" the anecdotal evidence sometimes seems overwhelming, even when the science is sketchy. the hamilton tiger-cats lost two promising players. defensive back jamaica jackson, 26, died of heart failure last april. offensive lineman travis claridge, 27, died mysteriously in las vegas of \"acute pneumonia, exacerbated by respiratory depression brought on by intoxication with the painkiller oxycodone,\" according to a cbc report. a few years ago, a mental breakdown put barret robbins, the oakland raiders pro bowl centre, in hospital on super bowl sunday. former blue bomber nick benjamin died at 46 of kidney failure, his body so beaten up he had to crawl to the bathroom at night. \"you have to be such an extremely fit individual to play at this level that it is hard to understand why these same guys are so susceptible later,\" laird says. \"how can that be the same person?\" last summer, former tiger-cat receiver leif pettersen, 57, died of a heart attack. former alouettes star tony proudfoot has lou gehrig's disease. sometimes pain becomes familiar and unquestioned. laird says that could explain what happened with his nfl counterpart gene upshaw, who was diagnosed with cancer on a sunday and was dead within the week. \"you just get used to the pain,\" laird says, \"you look at someone like gene...he thought all that pain he felt was because he played 16 years. i'd seen gene in march and noticed he lost weight but he looked great. someone else would've felt that and gone to a doctor .\" the stories tend to be less catastrophic in the nhl, but equally heart-breaking. pat lafontaine and brett lindros lost nhl careers prematurely due to concussions. eric lindros was also forced from the game after too many blows to the head. he is not going gently into the dark. \"you have big strong men, there's going to be high impact. inevitably concussions will occur. that being said, the respect level of our game has diminished so much that it has never been this low,\" says eric, who recently stepped down as an ombudsman with the players' association. the average nhl career is over in less than five years. and, while not everyone leaves on a stretcher, it doesn't minimize the hurt. \"i'd hate to see these goaltenders today who go down on every shot. i'd hate to think what their knees and hips are going to be like at 60,\" healy says. still, leave it to a puck warrior to find some levity amidst the ruins. \"you shake hands with johnny bower and you think:\" are those feet or hands?' he's broken every finger. they are, \"says healy, chuckling,\" enormous: like oktoberfest sausages. \"--the disabled list the following are examples of competitors who were severely injured while competing in their chosen sports.in some cases the injuries were career-ending or fatal. former buffalo sabres goaltender clint malarchuk bleeds profusely after his carotid artery was severed by the skate of st. louis blues' steve tuttle during a collision on march 22, 1989, in buffalo. more than 300 stitches were required to close the wound. florida panthers foward richard zednik, centre, is helped from the ice after his carotid artery was accidentally cut by the skate of teammate <mark>olli jokinen</mark> feb. 10, 2008, coincidentallyin buffalo. auto racing is inherently dangerous. many drivers have suffered serious injury or died as a result of crashes over the years. but few as high profile as seven-time nascar champion dale earnhardt sr. earnhardt was killed when he suffered a basilar skull fracture among other injuries in a last-lap crash during the 2001 daytona 500. earnhardt's death was the catalyst for various safety improvements in nascar. former buffalo bills tight end kevin everett is tended to by emergency personnel after sustaining a fracture and dislocation of his cervical spine during an nfl game in 2007. everett was temporarily paralyzed, but fortunately regained the ability to walk. he never played another game in the nfl. some other former nfl players to suffer serious neck injuries include mike utley (detroit lions, 1991), <mark>dennis byrd</mark>
