While less impressive artists brag and show off, the Radiohead drummer is the embodiment of cool. He speaks quietly and intelligently and is polite throughout. He is one of rock's few true gentlemen. You wouldn't think he had been headlining the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury just three months ago. \"I'm back home in Oxfordshire, which is good,\" he chuckles. \"There's time to take stock of everything that's going on and also to do some writing .\" It's been a busy year, with an epic Radiohead tour culminating in that Glasto show, in front of more than 100,000 fans and millions more on TV worldwide. But it is his latest project which has got him excited, ranking as a highpoint in a glittering career for the father of three, who lives in rural west Oxfordshire. Again demonstrating his ability as a composer, he has stepped from behind the drum kit, this time to write his first film soundtrack. Called Let Me Go, the movie, which premiered this month in Leicester Square, stars Juliet Stevenson and up-and-coming talent Lucy Boynton, and was produced by Lizzie Pickering, from Lyneham, near Burford, and directed by BAFTA-nominated Oxford University alumnus Polly Steele. Based on the true story of <mark>Helga Schneider</mark>, whose mother abandoned her as a four-year old to become a guard at Auschwitz during the Second World War, the film is a thought-provoking story of mothers and daughters over four generations. A thoroughly Oxford project, the soundtrack was recorded at Nick Moorbath's Evolution Studio, in Osney Mead, west Oxford. Nick is the former owner of the Zodiac in Cowley Road, once partly owned by Radiohead and the location for the video to their anthem Creep. Let Me Go has already won an award for Best Ensemble at Geena Davis's Bentonville Film Festival, in the US, which supports women in film (as well as having a female director and producer and four strong female cast members more than half the crew were women). The soundtrack follows Philip's previous solo albums, 2010's Familial and 2014's Weatherhouse. So how did the process of writing a soundtrack differ? \"There are some parallels,\" he says. \"Working in Evolution with Nick also felt very familiar and was a fruitful process .\" Some of the pieces keyed into what I'd done with the band and my solo stuff, but obviously there's a thing of fitting into a whole creative project, and at the heart of it is <mark>Helga Schneider</mark>'s true story and Polly Steele's interpretation and screenplay. There were all these other elements to respond to cinematically and in the performances themselves. \"From the outset I was writing pieces from just the screenplay and knowing who's going to play what role, and that was a productive time. But I also knew I had to release a soundtrack album that could be convincing in its own right .\" The result is haunting, brooding and quite beautiful. \"It was an emotional, rather than physical journey,\" says Philip, who as part of Radiohead has sold well over 30 million albums and racked up multiple awards. \"The film was chiefly set in Vienna, which also feeds into the tone of the music .\" It also makes it a little gloomy, I suggest. \"Yeah,\" he agrees. \"It deals with some weighty issues and contrasts between light and dark. It is looking at how generational trauma plays out and what <mark>Helga Schneider</mark>'s role was in Auschwitz. These are all deeply disturbing and emotionally rich subjects and they lead you in a particular way musically .\" And he enjoyed working close to home. \"There's a wealth of talent in Oxford and to be able to benefit from that and highlight that is great,\" says the keen Oxford United fan. \"It was brilliant working with Nick Moorbath again too. I have known him for a long time, since he ran the Cold Room studios in Cumnor when we first started to put ourselves out as a band. Nick is so central to the growth of Oxford's music scene. At the heart of his studio is a lovely mixing desk, and the studio reflects his personality. He's very talented as a musician and engineer .\" The release of the film, which is screened at the Ultimate Picture Palace off Cowley Road on October 11 and 12, and the soundtrack, out on vinyl and CD on the Bella Union label on October 27, tops an extraordinary year for Philip, including that Radiohead Glastonbury set, which he says was one of the highlights of his career. \"We spent the year working towards that,\" he says. \"It was an amazing experience being on that stage and having the opportunity to go back and do it again 20 years after our first headline set in 1997 .\" It's a good indication of what we've done as a band in that time. \"Looking back over the years, what has been his highpoint with Radiohead?\" I don't think I can narrow it down to one thing, but as a band I'd say some of our playing this year. It hit a new level for us and to actually get to this point is brilliant. \"So with Oxford fans deprived of a local show since 2005's South Park triumph, might we finally see another homecoming concert?\" There are no plans at the moment--but as with everything we do, never say never! \"In the meantime there is the question of the next Radiohead album, and Oxford United's new season to think about\" They have shown so much progress, \"he laughs .\" They are a championship team in the making! \"Let Me Go is at the Ultimate Picture Palace, Oxford on October 11 & 12.

A French team has already visited the airbase and a preliminary study has been completed. While some of the existing infrastructure will be used for the new Rafale squadron, additional infrastructure in the form of at least 14 new shelters, new hangars, new operating surfaces, a de-briefing room and a facility for simulator training will be created, for which Rs 227 crore ($35 million) has been sanctioned. \"The construction work for the new infrastructure will start in January or February 2018. The French team has given its requirements and the preliminary work has been completed,\" the Commanding Officer of the Ambala airbase, <mark>Air</mark> Commodore L.K. Chawla, told IANS, adding that the upgraded infrastructure is expected to last at least 40 to 50 years. The French team has promised a 70 percent serviceability factor for the Rafales and there is also a long-term contract for the supply of spares. Golden Arrows, 17 Squadron, will initially comprise four Rafales that are likely to arrive in September 2019, with the number being gradually ramped up to a full-strength of 18 by 2022. The squadron had seen action during the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan when it flew MiG-21s under the command of the present Indian <mark>Air</mark> Force <mark>chief</mark>, <mark>Air Chief Marshal</mark> B.S. Dhanoa, then a Wing Commander. The frontline Ambala airbase, under the Western <mark>Air</mark> Command, is the principal guardian of the airspace over the national capital, a five minute flying distance away. The Pakistan border is just over 200 km away. Currently two squadrons of Jaguar fighter jets, and one squadron of MiG-21 Bisons are based in Ambala. The MiG-21s will be shifted to the Nal airbase in Rajasthan before the Rafales arrive. The second squadron of Rafales will begin arriving once Ambala is at full strength and these aircraft will be stationed at Hashimara in the east, close to the China border. India and France signed a 7.8 billion euros (Rs 59,000 crore / $8.7 billion) inter-government agreement for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighters, off the shelf, on September 23 last year. This was after prolonged negotiations over the price and other aspects of the deal, which was agreed upon during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France in April 2015. The deal includes an offset clause of 50 percent of the value of the aircraft and its weapons package will be discharged by the manufacturer through purchase from Indian firms.

But no details of the planned repatriation were given by Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.H Mahmood Ali, and there was widespread scepticism over whether any of the more than 800,000 Muslim Rohingya now in Bangladesh would return. More than half a million have arrived over the last five weeks after militant attacks in Myanmar's Rakhine state sparked violent reprisals which the UN has said could amount to ethnic cleansing in the Buddhist-dominated country. The talks between Mahmood Ali and Myanmar's Minister of the Office of State Counselor Kyaw Tint Swe came as UN representatives were given their first access to Rakhine since the trouble erupted on August 25. UN officials, diplomats and aid groups were taken on a one-day visit organised by Myanmar authorities. They were flown by helicopter to Maungdaw, epicentre of the violence. Mahmood Ali held what he called \"friendly\" talks in Dhaka with the representative of Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. \"Myanmar has made a proposal to take back the Rohingya refugees,\" the minister told reporters. \"The two sides have agreed to a proposal to set up a joint working group to coordinate the repatriation process .\" Suu Kyi, who has been severely criticised for her failure to curb the military crackdown, said last month that Myanmar would take back \"verified\" refugees. This would be done according to criteria agreed in 1993, when tens of thousands of Rohingya were repatriated, she said. The Bangladesh minister gave no timeframe for repatriation and did not say whether Myanmar would also take back 300,000 Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh during earlier violence. He said refugees would be verified by the joint working group, but without UN involvement. \"Bangladesh has proposed a bilateral agreement (with Myanmar) to help implement the repatriation,\" he said. There was no immediate comment from Suu Kyi's representative, who was to return to his country on Monday. Myanmar denies the Rohingya minority citizenship even though many have lived there for generations. It considers the Muslims as illegal migrants from Bangladesh .--No papers, no state--Myanmar's insistence on verifying the Rohingya could prove a \"stumbling block\" to repatriation, according to Shahab Enam Khan, an international relations specialist at Jahangirnagar University. \"Myanmar has shown good initiative but their proposal is not adequate, particularly the verification is a non-starter,\" he told AFP. \"The Rohingya fled to Bangladesh without any legal documents and it is difficult to prove their identity .\" <mark>Mohammad Amin</mark>, who arrived in Bangladesh on Sunday with two neighbours in a rickety boat, said he would consider returning if their safety was guaranteed. \"If they treat us as equals, we would go back,\" he told AFP in a coastal town near the border. Nurul <mark>Amin</mark>, a labourer who also arrived Sunday by boat with six of his family members, said they fled after Buddhist mobs threatened them with violence if they did not leave. \"If they accept us as Rohingya, and said they would not harm us, we would return,\" he told AFP at a refugee registration booth. The refugees are packed into overcrowded UN and makeshift camps along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Aid groups have warned that epidemics could easily spread in the desperate conditions. It remains unclear where the Rohingya would go if they were returned to Myanmar. Many of their villages have been burnt to the ground in the reprisal operations. In a speech to the UN General Assembly last month, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed creating UN-supervised safe zones inside Myanmar. Hasina accused Myanmar authorities of laying landmines on the border to prevent the Rohingya from returning and said the UN must find a solution to the crisis .--AFP", "articleID": "2017100216_00193736_W", "names": {"Mohammad Amin": ["Q17516076", "Q19881928", "Q20675862", "Q59279480"]}}, {"date": "2017-10-02", "url": "http://www.thedp.com/blog/under-the-button/2017/10/engineering-chair-transfers-to-mit", "content": "Satire Published 7 minutes ago This Student Was Elected to Represent the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
