But that's the whole thing, as everybody else is saying--the three movies (and animes) are fine as-is and hold up, it doesn't need a reboot. Nobody's asking for it. I could take a sequel, prequel, spin-off (and the material is there already--per Reloaded, the Matrix history goes back through five or six other versions of \"The One,\" so there could be many possibilities for more films or even a TV series). But reboot?! Hell no. . [Show spoiler] 11 WB, let's talk. Just because someone decided to make a movie based off Ghost in the Shell, that doesn't mean you have to rush and pull the closest thing you have in your IP closet out for a remake. For starters, they're not even that close. We don't even know if GITS is going to make that much money. The Matrix is already a pretty good movie and even though it's approaching drinking age, it hasn't withered. Besides, you're already preoccupied with ruining your DCU stable. You don't need to ruin everything you own. Thank you ....and sometimes I miss my 1985 RCA console TV. That reminds me, I wonder what's become of that Neuromancer adaptation? Will it ever see the light of day? (wikipedia says it's in a Chinese company's hands now) And a Snow Crash movie is in the works. Big cyberpunk wave is coming our way. I can see why WB wants to surf on it now. 3 Maybe Keanu can convince WB to do a sequel with him as the lead instead of this reboot crap. I mean, he is on top of his game currently and audiences love him in the John Wick films. He is hot NOW, and people want more badass action films with him as the lead. This would be a good time to the The Matrix 4 and John Wick: Chapter 3 right after that. 54 Remember when The X-Files revival was called a \"reboot\" ? More recently, the Twin Peaks revival keeps being referred to as \"reboot\" by the media. Considering how misused that term has become this'll end up being a sequel/prequel/spinoff etc.. Existing in the same universe but focusing on new characters. Last edited by spanky87; Today at 01:59 AM. Not happening, it will be an all black movie.

Christopher Neil Rowson, 31, and Shaun Michael Mather, 35, were both handed long jail terms in the WA District Court last week over the multimillion dollar drug bust.

Federal police officers had been monitoring Mather, the court heard, as part of an operation targeting the Lone Wolf outlaw motorcycle gang. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Police seized 2.1 kg of meth from the scene, including 1.7 kg from the spa water. Photo: Supplied Police raided the Mount Richon rental home after Mather arrived there and after he had met with a patched member of the Lone Wolf gang. As police officers made their way to the back of the property, they saw Mather holding open the lid of the spa and emptying methamphetamine from plastic bags into it. Advertisement In doing so, he also spilled a quantity of the drug onto the ground next to the spa. Details of how police were able to extract large quantities of the drug from the spa water were revealed in court as the pair were sentenced. Police had intended to empty the entire contents of the spa - some 700 litres of water - into 25 large plastic containers. But the containers were only able to hold 595 litres, so only 595 litres of the spa water was tested. Police emptied the other 105 litres of remaining spa water onto the back lawn. ChemCentre specialists took samples from each of the 25 containers. The samples were tested and the concentration levels of methamphetamine in each one was determined. From those concentration levels, police were able to calculate the amount of meth in each of the 25 containers. The total amount of methamphetamine seized by police from the scene was 2.1 kg, including 1.7 kg from the spa water. The drugs had a street value of more than $2 million. Mather pleaded guilty to one count of possessing methamphetamine with intent to sell or supply. He was jailed for 13 years. Rowson was convicted after a trial of three offences relating to the seized drugs and weapons found in the home. He was jailed for 15 years. Judge <mark>Stephen Scott</mark> said he had to send a strong message to methamphetamine dealers who were fuelling the significant crime rate being committed by those who seek the drug .\" Those crimes being burglaries, robberies and significant gratuitous violence, \"Judge <mark>Scott</mark> said .\" The court does need to demonstrate, as best sentencing, a zero tolerance with respect to those who deal in this insidious drug. \"Both Rowson and Mather were made eligible for parole after 11 and 13 years respectively.", "articleID": "2017031601_00281800_W", "names": {"Stephen Scott": ["Q2345068", "Q7610488"]}}, {"date": "2017-03-16", "url": "http://playbill.com/article/acting-company-tour-arrives-in-nyc-march-17", "content": "Acting Company Tour Arrives in NYC March 17 | Playbill Mar 17, 2017 The company presents two plays in repertory, X: Or, Betty Shabazz v.

Photo: Peter Lo, Taipei Times Employers would not have had any problems implementing the \"one fixed day off and one flexible rest day\" policy if they had been complying with the Labor Standards Act (\u52de\u52d5\u57fa\u6e96\u6cd5) all along, Premier <mark>Lin Chuan</mark> (\u6797\u5168) said yesterday. The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus and Nantou County Commissioner <mark>Lin</mark> Ming-chen (\u6797\u660e\u6eb1) on Thursday said that the central government should take responsibility for the public's complaints about the new labor policy and asked for more \"flexibility\" for employers. The policy has significantly increased costs in the ready-mixed concrete industry, while relations between workers and employers have deteriorated, Taiwan Ready-Mixed Concrete Association chairperson Chu Jui-lu (\u6731\u745e\u7210) said. \"Many businesses might fold this year. We might witness a wave of bankruptcies,\" Chu told the Chinese-language Economic Daily News. <mark>Lin</mark> said that many businesses have been stoking tensions by mentioning problems related to general management, many of which were not caused by the policy, \"but due to that [the businesses] did not closely follow the Labor Standards Act in the past .\" The government's follow-up to the act's implementation and its examination of the problems reportedly caused by the policy has shown that the problems mostly arose from lax execution of the labor law prior to its amendment, the premier said, adding that the government would continue to monitor the effects of the policy and communicate with the public. The Ministry of Labor yesterday announced that the logistics industry will be allowed flexibility when applying Article 30, Paragraph 3 of the act, which stipulates that employers, with prior consent from the relevant unions, can distribute the regular working hours over eight weeks, provided that the regular working time does not exceed eight hours per day and the total number of working hours do not exceed 48 hours per week. It would collect opinions regarding the measure, it said. Asked about the proposed relaxation and whether other industries would be given similar flexibility, the premier said he would respect the ministry's decision. However, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Alicia Wang (\u738b\u80b2\u654f) said the government should set \"a final tone\" instead of using executive orders to relax prohibitions that it established, \"which leaves everyone baffled .\" This story has been viewed 89 times.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Reuters By Balazs Koranyi BADEN-BADEN, Germany (Reuters) - The world's biggest economies will pledge to jointly fight cyber attacks on the global banking system, one of the biggest coordinated efforts yet to protect lenders since an $81 million heist of the Bangladesh central bank's account last year. Meeting in the German resort town of Baden-Baden, G20 finance chiefs will agree to fight attacks regardless of their origin and promise cross-border cooperation to maintain financial stability, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. \"We will promote the resilience of financial services and institutions in G20 jurisdictions against malicious use of information and communication technologies, including from countries outside the G20,\" it said. However, it dropped an earlier reference for enhanced security requirements for financial services. Cyber crime became a top priority after an elaborate heist on the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year, an unprecedented theft that exposed the vulnerabilities of the system. The agreement, set to be finalised on Saturday, will come just days after the United States charged two intelligence agents from Russia, another G20 member, with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. The indictment was the first time U.S. authorities have criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences including for computer fraud, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and wire fraud. The charges came amid a swirl of controversies relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of U.S. President Donald Trump. In the banking world, attacks through the global SWIFT bank transfer system have continued to increase with the network recording a \"meaningful\" number of attacks with about a fifth of them resulting in stolen funds since the Bangladesh heist, the firm said late last year. In other highly publicized attacks, retailer Tesco Plc's banking arm said 2.5 million pounds ($3 million) had been stolen from 9,000 customers last year while hackers also stole more than 2 billion rubles ($34 million) from correspondent accounts at the Russian central bank and from accounts in commercial banks. The European Union is considering testing banks' defenses against cyber attacks with concerns growing about the industry's vulnerability to hacking.
