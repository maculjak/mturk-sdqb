(AP) - A family of four whose remains were found at the burned-down ruins of their New Jersey mansion was slain before the home was set ablaze, authorities said Wednesday, hours after the mansion owner's brother was arrested on suspicion of arson at his own house. Prosecutors sought to reassure the public that a random killer was not on the loose in the affluent community of Colts Neck, which is also home to some celebrities. \"We believe that this family in some form or fashion was targeted,\" Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said. Paul Caneiro, 51, was charged with setting fire to his home Tuesday in Ocean Township. Less than eight hours later, the fire that destroyed his brother's home was reported about 80 miles (129 kilometers) away in Colts Neck, authorities said. Gramiccioni said he could neither confirm nor deny that Paul Caniero was a suspect in the slayings. At the mansion, Keith Caniero, 50, was found shot to death on the lawn. Inside, authorities found the remains of his 45-year-old wife, Jennifer Caniero, and their children, 11-year-old son Jesse and 8-year-old daughter Sophia. The bodies of the mother and children were badly burned. Medical examiners had not determined causes of death for them as of Wednesday afternoon. It was not immediately known if Paul Caniero had retained an attorney. He was charged with aggravated arson and was scheduled to make a first appearance in court next Wednesday. Paul Caneiro was accused of using gasoline to set his home on fire while his wife and two daughters were inside. No one was hurt in that blaze, which was reported at 5 a.m. Tuesday, about 7 1/2 hours before the Colts Neck fire was reported. Keith and Paul Caneiro were partners at a technology firm in Asbury Park called Square One. All four members of Keith Caniero's family were \"victims of homicidal violence,\" the prosecutor said, adding that there was no indication of suicide. The community held a vigil for the family Wednesday night. Colts Neck Mayor J.P. Bartolomeo said the Caneiros were well known in town and often seen at local shops or school sporting events. Colts Neck, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of New York City, is home to a number of celebrities, including Bruce Springsteen. Former \"Daily Show\" host <mark>Jon Stewart</mark> and his wife operate an animal sanctuary there. Queen Latifah sold her mansion there in 2015. Current and former members of the band Bon Jovi have also called it home. ___ Follow Wayne Parry at http: //twitter.com/WayneParryAC Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Daniela Tejada condemned the Foreign Office over the handling of the case of 31-year-old PhD student <mark>Matthew Hedges</mark>, ahead of her meeting with Foreign Secretary <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> on Thursday. Mr <mark>Hunt</mark> has threatened the UAE with \"serious diplomatic consequences\" if Mr <mark>Hedges</mark> is not freed, saying he has seen \"absolutely no evidence\" to support the charge. The Cabinet minister is understood to have met with the UAE ambassador in London on Thursday morning and had a \"very frank\" conversation with him. But Ms Tejada, having landed back at Heathrow Airport, said the UK had \"failed\" to take a firm stance over the Durham University student from the start of his ordeal. \"I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and his welfare,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"They were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance .\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the Foreign Office on the show for working \"behind the scenes\" to support Mr <mark>Hedges</mark>, with Mr <mark>Hunt</mark> appealing personally to the Crown Prince on November 12. Ms Tejeda, who was at the Abu Dhabi court when Mr <mark>Hedges</mark> was sentenced during a five-minute hearing on Wednesday, is expected to quiz Mr <mark>Hunt</mark> over what efforts the Government will make to secure Mr <mark>Hedges</mark>'s release. She has made it clear she believes the UK should stop at nothing to free the \"innocent\" Briton, who was jailed after the UAE presented \"completely fabricated\" evidence. Her calls for immediate action were echoed by Tory MP Johnny Mercer, who condemned the academic's jailing and called for the Government to be resilient. He wrote on Twitter: \"This is ridiculous. Our Defence assistance, mentoring and intelligence relationships alone with this country should preclude absurd things like this happening. From a friend and partner, simply unacceptable .\" Consequences must be immediate until he is released. \"This is ridiculous.

He'll be in some form of national security jail and it's horrific there .\" Mr Haigh, a former managing director of Leeds United, said he was tortured and raped while he was held in a Dubai jail over a fraud conviction that was later overturned. David Haigh (Martin Rickett/PA) <mark>Theresa May</mark> said she was \"deeply disappointed and concerned\" by Mr <mark>Hedges</mark>'s jailing and told MPs the UK \"will continue to press this matter at the highest level with the Emiratis\".

The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:06:12 64 kbps | MP3 Pop-out player Burning coal for energy adds planet-warming carbon dioxide, or CO2, to Earth's atmosphere. As the planet heats up, experts warn that simply cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to avoid possibly disastrous levels of global warming. CO2 must also be removed from the atmosphere, they say. Existing experimental machines that pull CO2 directly from the air are too costly to be widely used. But a new report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says effective carbon-removal technology already exists. It is not costly, or even complex science. It is forests. The report explains that planting trees and overseeing forests are cost-effective ways to clean the air. They also work well across large areas. Forests used to cover large areas of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. In the state of West Virginia, a kind of mining known as strip mining left the land there bare, without trees. Now experts are working to bring back the forests that once covered much of the state. West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest is home to a rare group of trees. They are called virgin woods; they have never been touched by humans. <mark>Shane Jones</mark> is a biologist with the U.S. Forest Service. \"Living in the East, there's not many places you can go and be untouched by Man .\" <mark>Jones</mark> says the trees there were missed by mistake when the surrounding forest was cut down for wood many years ago. That mistake turned out to be a good thing; red spruce forests such as those in the Monongahela are great at taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and locking it into the soil. <mark>Jones</mark> explains as he runs his hand through the dark black earth beside a tree. \"See all that organic material? It's black because it's incredibly high in carbon .\" Over the years, coal mining and cutting forests took over 90 percent of the red spruce forests from the Appalachian Mountains. Now, as the planet warms, the need for forests to remove coal's CO2 is increasingly urgent. <mark>Chris Barton</mark> works for the University of Kentucky. As he walks along the Appalachian land, he says the needs of warm-weather rainforests get most of the world's attention. \"But here in the temperate region of the world, in Appalachia, four hours away from Washington, D.C., we have billions of trees that potentially we could be planting .\" So, <mark>Barton</mark> started a group called Green Forests Work. Its members aim to put trees back on the roughly 400,000 hectares of land that was cleared away by strip mining. However, <mark>Barton</mark> explains, the land has problems. \"If you went out and planted trees on these sites, they just didn't grow. The ground was way too compacted. Water didn't infiltrate. Roots can't penetrate. Oxygen can't circulate in those environments .\" The solution? Using heavy equipment, workers tear up the ground. The process lets the trees they plant put down roots. <mark>Barton</mark> says not everyone believes the solution is a good idea. \"We've had a lot of people kinda look at us twice. But the really interesting thing about it is, after we do it, there's no question that that was the right thing to do .\" And it has worked. Forests are coming back to the grounds. Scientists say that, in West Virginia alone, restoring red spruce forests to the area could send what is equal to 56 million barrels of oil into the ground. But it will take time. A long time. Around the world, experts say, nature offers powerful tools to fight climate change. But patience is needed, <mark>Jones</mark> says. \"It's really awesome to see a tree planted eight years ago that's now waist high. But at the end of the day, at the end of my day, we're barely getting started. Because our main goal with the restoration work that we do here is to basically take actions to then let nature take over .\" Nature works, but slowly, in its own time. I'm Anne Ball.
