as fausto carmona has been released from jail on bail in the dominican republic, but it is unclear how long it might be before he is able to return to the united states. the assocated press reported that carmona was released on friday after his arrest one day earlier for using a false identity. it has been reported that the pitcher's actual name is <mark>roberto hernandez</mark> heredia. carmona was arrested on thursday outside the united states consulate in santo domingo while on his way to apply for a visa so he can travel to arizona for spring training. the indians are currently working to gather more information to determine their next step in response to the situation. according to the ap report, carmona was released by judge keyla perez on bail of around $13,000. carmona was then instructed to check in with prosecutors as dominican authorities continue to investigate the matter. one allegation is that carmona is actually 31 years old, not 28, as he has claimed. the pitcher offered a brief statement as he exited the court friday. \"i ask for the forgiveness of my fans, the government of the united states and the cleveland indians for this situation,\" he was quoted as saying. the indians have yet to issue public comments beyond a statement issued by general manager chris antonetti on thursday. \"we were recently made aware of the situation that occurred [thursday] in the dominican republic,\" antonetti said, \"and are currently in the process of gathering information. we are not prepared to make any additional comment at this time .\" the pitcher's agent, bean stringfellow, has yet to return messages left by mlb.com. agent jay alou, who works for the same agency, told the associated press on thursday that the pitcher's representatives were stunned by the news. \"this took us by complete surprise,\" alou was quoted as saying. \"what we have to do now is wait to find out the process that has to be done with the consulate with this new identity in order to see if he can get a new work visa .\" one possible approach for cleveland would be to place carmona (under contract for $7 million in 2012) on major league baseball's restricted list. players on the restricted list do not count towards a team's 25-man or 40-man roster, do not receive pay and are not permitted to sign with another club. that was the route the marlins took when dealing with a similar situation. in september, the pitcher formerly known as leo nunez was forced to return to the dominican republic after it was discovered that he was playing under an assumed name. his real name is juan carlos oviedo and he admitted to using false documents in order to sign a professional contract. oviedo remains on the restricted list and the pitcher is still sorting through visa issues, even though he has cooperated with investigators. the marlins signed oviedo to a $6 million contract to avoid arbitration on tuesday, but the club does not have to pay the pitcher until he is back in the united states and off the restricted list. right now, it is not known if the indians would simply be able to void carmona's contract, or if the club would go down that route if allowed. it is also not clear how carmona's predicament might impact his availability for spring training (pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report on feb. 19) or the regular season. carmona's birth date has been listed as dec. 7, 1983, which would have made him 17 years old when he signed with the indians as a non-drafted free agent in 2000. it is possible that carmona was actually as old as 20 when he first pitched in cleveland's farm system. the right-handed sinkerballer broke in with the indians as a reliever in 2006, and he finished fourth in the american league cy young balloting after going 19-8 with a 3.06 era in the 2007 campaign. he's been erratic over the last few seasons, notching a 33-48 record and a 5.01 era in 111 starts between 2008 and 2011. last season, the pitcher went 7-15 with a 5.25 era in 32 starts after beginning the year as the indians' opening day starter. heading into the 2012 season, he projected to work within the nos. 3-5 slots in the rotation. the indians hold club options on his contract for 2013 and 2014. @ mlbastian. this story was not subject to the approval of major league baseball or its clubs .? 2001 - mlb advanced media, l.p. all rights reserved.",

"content": "giants blog last updated: 4:18 am, january 28, 2012 mark cannizzaro foxborough, mass. - the subject is already a sore one for the patriots. and, because the scab is going to be picked at for the next week, the wound might be bleeding by kickoff in super bowl xlvi. yes, the patriots are well aware the giants defensive front had as much do to with their devastating perfect-season-ending super bowl loss four years ago as david tyree and divine intervention did. yes, the patriots know the giants defensive front was a big part of the reason they lost to them again earlier this season, a 24-20 defeat at gillette stadium. pressure point: the patriots offensive line, ransacked the last time they met the giants' fearsome pass rush in the super bowl, will be asked to respond with better protection of <mark>tom brady</mark> this time around. and yes, the patriots realize the giants defensive front could be the difference in this super bowl if it is able to manhandle the new england offensive line again. \"every time we play them you talk about their defense, their pass rush,\" patriots quarterback <mark>tom brady</mark> said. \"we have our work cut out for us .\" with the super bowl week media onslaught having not even begun yet, <mark>brady</mark> and his offensive line are going to be sick of hearing the names jason pierre-paul (16? sacks, two forced fumbles), justin tuck (five sacks), osi umenyiora (nine sacks, two forced fumbles) and <mark>chris canty</mark> (four sacks). the members of the patriots' offensive line are going to be reminded over and over about the job the giants' defensive front did on them in the super bowl four years ago. it promises to be one of the themes of the week. eli manning was named the mvp of that super bowl, but anyone who watched the game (including eli) knows the giants' defensive front should have been given that honor. that made the patriots' offensive line the goats in that game. \"that was four years ago - next question,\" patriots left guard logan mankins said yesterday when asked about that super bowl. touchy, touchy. \"i don't think i was there for that one,\" patriots left tackle matt light said, making an attempt at humor while deflecting the question with a non-answer. \"they're all very good athletes,\" said light, the senior member of the line. \"they can line up anywhere, whether they're walking around behind the line or switching from defensive end to defensive tackle, those guys are an athletic group .\" they play well with each other, running [pass rush] games. when you have a group like that you can't just isolate any one of them. other teams try to do similar things with their guys [as the giants do] moving them around, but i'd say [the giants] are probably the best. \"they're very opportunistic. they capitalize on other peoples' mistakes, and they're athletic enough to create a lot of plays on their own. they're a confident group, and they should be based on the way they've been playing .\" light, mankins and the rest of <mark>brady</mark>'s protectors - a group that likely will include rookie right tackle nate solder, who has been playing in place of the injured <mark>sebastian vollmer</mark> - know they need to be the difference in the game. if they aren't, then the giants' defensive front again will be the difference, and perhaps this time will be named the collective mvps. even the great <mark>brady</mark> is vulnerable when he gets knocked around, especially with pressure up the middle, because his comfort zone is stepping up in the pocket. \"they can rush the passer, there's no doubt about that,\" <mark>brady</mark> said. \"they put a lot of pressure on you with their front four. they get a lot of turnovers. they have a big, physical group that plays really well together .\" mankins said a key to handling the giants' front is recognizing their personnel from play to play, because they often have four defensive ends in the game and no defensive tackles, making them a more dangerous pass-rushing bunch. new york post is a registered trademark of nyp holdings, inc. .", "articleID": "2012012809_00080042_W", "names": {"Chris Canty":

france said it plans to pull out most of its military personnel by the end of 2013 - a year earlier than the nato deadline. french president nicolas sarkozy made the announcement following talks with his afghan counterpart. at the prime minister's country residence chequers, mr <mark>cameron</mark> and mr karzai will discuss security progress and will sign a pledge setting out the next stage in
