MOJO \u201960s Volume 9, featuring The Zombies, Keith Moon and more. The venerable group, still led by original undead Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent, are set to tour the US later this month, and are also due to play their classic Odessey And Oracle album in its entirety at the prestigious London Palladium on September 29. \"I'm mystified that people are still discovering the record,\" says Blunstone, speaking to Lois Wilson in MOJO \u201960s Volume 9. \"I can only explain the renewed interest through word of mouth. Musicians like <mark>Paul Weller</mark> and Dave Grohl often say how much they like the album and that has led to its reassessment and helped introduce it to new generations.\" Odessey And Oracle occupies an exceptional place in the rock canon. Widely proclaimed a work of genius comparable with The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, it is also, simultaneously somehow, a well-kept secret. In many respects, this dichotomy is symptomatic of the position in which the band found themselves back in early 1968 just prior to the album's release. Formed in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in the early \u201960s, The Zombies arrived in the disguise of a typical beat group of the time. Their debut single, She's Not There (released in August 1964), provided them with a Top 20 UK hit and peaked at Number 2 in the US, the track characterised by Colin Blunstone's winsome vocal and composer Rod Argent's electric piano. In terms of commercial pop success, they never bettered it. However, by 1967 The Zombies' sound had grown more sophisticated and they'd signed to CBS, beginning work on a more ambitious second album. Their budget was modest--a mere \u00a3 1000, with sessions beginning in June and using downtime at Abbey Road and Olympic Studios. However, by the time Odessey And Oracle emerged in April' 68, the five-piece of Blunstone, Argent, <mark>Paul Atkinson</mark> (guitar), <mark>Chris White</mark> (bass) and Hugh Grundy (drums) had effectively split. The failure of two singles prior to the album's release--Friends Of Mine (October' 67) and Care Of Cell 44 (released November' 67)--contributed to their disillusionment with the industry, exacerbating internal tensions over the band's musical direction. Since then Odessey's reputation has grown amongst connoisseurs and, to a degree, mainstream audiences. The album was afforded further exposure when, from the late \u201990s onwards, key track Time Of The Season was used in a string of TV commercials to sell goods as diverse as women's hygiene products, soft drinks and cider. In addition to their appearance in MOJO \u201960s, the group and their masterpiece album are documented in a brand new book entitled The Odessey: The Zombies In Words And Images which is published by Reel Art Press/BMG Books. The band's touring plans can be found at their website www.thezombiesmusic.com. MOJO \u201960s Volume 9, featuring The Zombies, Keith Moon, The Doors, Dusty Springfield, The Temptations, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Zappa and Beefheart posters, and more, is in UK shops now.

(Photo: None) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN EMAILMORE \"Conscious uncoupling\" doesn't always spell trouble. After Coldplay frontman <mark>Chris Martin</mark> and now-ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow announced their split in March 2014, the British band released its sullen Ghost Stories just two months later: a sparse, muted breakup album which they didn't support on tour and was generally dismissed as a forgettable, phoned-in effort. USA TODAY \"Head Full of Dreams' finds Coldplay in a happy place But more than a year and a couple famous girlfriends (Jennifer Lawrence, Annabelle Wallis) later, <mark>Martin</mark> sounds reinvigorated and ready to move forward. On seventh (and possibly final) album A Head Full of Dreams, the wistful rockers are sonically adventurous and optimistic, even while occasionally offering more of the same. Dreams (*** out of four) starts with the euphoric title track, as <mark>Martin</mark> sings about his flights of fancy over a bright, throttling rush of drums and guitar. Birds is similarly urgent and uplifting in its lofty ambitions of escape and one day\" flying free, \"and like Dreams, could have fit right in on Coldplay's full-bore pop album Mylo Xyloto in 2011. But where the album truly takes off is on Beyonc\u00e9 collaboration Hymn for the Weekend: a blistering duet on which she and <mark>Martin</mark> trade verses about feeling drunk and high on love over producer Stargate's lurching, vibrant beat. More than any Dreams cut, Hymn is poised to be a Top 40 staple next year and deservedly so. While the album's jaunty mood signals a new beginning for <mark>Martin</mark>, Paltrow's presence is felt in more ways than one. For starters, the actress/singer's faint vocals are heard on piano ballad Everglow, in which he sings that\" you're with me wherever I go. \"<mark>Martin</mark> is more blunt about their 10-year relationship on the Tove Lo-assisted Fun, saying that although it's over and done,\" don't say it was all a waste / didn't we have fun? \"Other lyrics will surely be picked over as fans scour for clues into the couple's demise (most intriguingly:\" I know it's over before she says / Now someone else has taken your place \"). Coldplay's <mark>Chris Martin</mark> performs during the American Music Awards late last month. (Photo: Getty Images) If Paltrow's cameo is slightly awkward, it at least shows that <mark>Martin</mark> has made peace as he moves into the next stage of his life. It's a point he drives home in the album's more overwrought second half through songs such as Amazing Day, Up & Up and Army of One, which brim with as many positive platitudes as their titles suggest (although Army's hip-hop leanings make it Dreams' most curiously enjoyable oddity). Perhaps the most telling song is not <mark>Martin</mark>'s at all, but a piano interlude called Kaleidoscope, which excerpts poem The Guest House by the philosopher Rumi. Suggesting that one must welcome joy, depression and meanness, and\" be grateful for whoever comes, \"the two-minute inclusion encapsulates <mark>Martin</mark>'s current zen, and sets the stage for his future creative endeavors, whether he's joined by his band or not.

(St. Paul Pioneer Press file photo) MINNEAPOLIS--Since they skated to 1-1 tie in Minneapolis on Nov. 14, 2009, the Minnesota Gophers women's hockey team has a winning streak of more than 40 consecutive games over in-state rival Minnesota State Mankato in the past decade. But the Mavericks will get a shot at stopping the slide in a unique setting this season. On Dec. 7, the Gophers and Mavericks will meet in the annual U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame Museum Women's Face-Off Classic, to be played at the at the Dakotah! Ice Center in Prior Lake, Minn. \"We are thrilled to once again be playing in the Hall of Fame game versus Minnesota State Mankato,\" said Gophers coach Brad Frost in a statement. \"We know the atmosphere will be great as Division I women's hockey comes to a community arena in Prior Lake.\" The game raises awareness of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame Museum in Eveleth, Minn., along with bringing women's Division I hockey to a local community. Last season, the event was held in Brainerd, Minn., with St. Cloud State beating Bemidji State, 3-0. In addition to the college game in Prior Lake, there will be a girls high school game between Prior Lake and Rosemount, and a girls 12UA & 12UB tournament. Game proceeds will go to the Community Action Partnership of Scott, Carver & Dakota counties plus the Greater Mankato Area United Way. The Gophers won the WCHA last season and advanced to the NCAA title game, falling to archrival Wisconsin there, and finishing with a 32-6-1 overall record. The Mavericks, in former Olympian <mark>John Harrington</mark>'s fourth season as their coach, were 9-19-7 overall. Dakotah!

The Titans head of performance and culture said the season may finish on Saturday night with the final home against the Dragons but the hard work begins on Monday morning. \"The focus of the players and coaches may not extend much further than Saturday night, but for us working behind the scenes at the club, the view is a little further afield. November 1, to be precise,\" Meninga told members. \"Much has been made of the fact that the Titans have Jai Arrow and AJ Brimson off-contract at the end of 2020 - and therefore, both players are able to be approached by rival clubs from November 1.\" But it seems to have been forgotten there are 15 other NRL clubs with talented players able to negotiate in the first week of November.

We will apply our new recruitment criteria in assessing the credentials of players we are interested in. \"Are they from the Gold Coast? Are they the right character to be Titans? Can they improve us as a club on and off the field with the standards they expect from themselves and demand from others?\" Plenty fit that criteria.
