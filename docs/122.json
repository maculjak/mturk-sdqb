Slater famously received Origin's top individual award despite only featuring in two matches in a series where the Blues wrapped up victory in the first two matches. <mark>Gould</mark> couldn't help himself on Monday night as he outlined by prediction that NSW will win the series decider at ANZ Stadium by just one point, thanks to a <mark>James Maloney</mark> field goal. When asked by host <mark>James Bracey</mark> about who will receive the medal in 2019, <mark>Gould</mark> responded: \"Billy Slater\".

Gus' prediction for #Origin Man of the Series; Billy Slater .?? He wasn't expecting that one .?? #100PercentFooty | 10.20 pm on @ Channel9 pic.twitter.com/lj4oy5SLsv--NRL on Nine (@ NRLonNine) July 8, 2019 It comes as a fresh report on Tuesday outlined the changes the NRL has made to the voting on the prestigious award following the farce of 2018. The Daily Telegraph reports that judges for the award - Mal Meninga, Laurie Daley and Darren Lockyer - will now only vote for players who turned out in all three Origin matches. The voting panel will also convene at the end of Game 3 to vote separately on a player of the series - rather than rely on the votes of the individual three matches. Billy Slater could only laugh. After Wednesday night's game three, the trio will vote for the man of the match. They will then be presented with a shortlist of eligible players for the man of the series. Those players will have to have played every game with Cameron Munster and Dane Gagai expected to lead Queensland's candidates, while NSW's contenders are shaping as James Tedesco and Jake Trbojevic, Tom Trbojevic and Damien Cook. It was revealed last month Blues coach Brad Fittler was still angry about the decision to hand the 2018 gong to Slater. The Sydney Morning Herald's <mark>Andrew Webster</mark> told Macquarie Sports Radio, Fittler was seething at the decision to award Slater the top individual honour. \"I just know after seeing Freddy in the rooms after last year, he was filthy,\" <mark>Webster</mark> said. \"He was absolutely filthy that Billy Slater got it .\" Damien Cook, Boyd Cordner and James Tedesco were all thought to have been the clear favourites for the award, but the voting anomaly allowed Slater to sneak past the Blues stars.

The full Commonwealth Court scheduled a March 11 hearing in Harrisburg to decide if the case can go forward, said Brett Schaeffer, policy analyst for the Education Law Center, an advocacy group. Wilkes-Barre Area School District, Shenandoah Valley School District in Schuylkill County and Panther Valley District in Carbon County are among several school district plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs include Tracey Hughes on behalf of her unnamed minor son, an eighth grader at E.L. Meyers Junior-Senior High School in Wilkes-Barre. The lawsuit seeks court action to erase disparities in per-pupil spending between richer and poorer school districts across Pennsylvania. Often reflecting variations in property values, education spending ranges from a low of $9,800 per pupil to a peak of $28,400 per pupil, said the Education Law Center and Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia. These groups, school districts and parents filed the lawsuit last November saying the Legislature and governor have failed to uphold a state constitutional obligation to provide public education that gives all children the resources they need to meet state-imposed academic standards. The lawsuit was filed following former Gov. Tom Corbett's re-election defeat. Attorneys for Corbett and the House and Senate filed motions on Jan. 16 seeking to dismiss the case. It is uncertain what legal course Gov. <mark>Tom Wolf</mark> will take, advocates said. <mark>Wolf</mark> spoke in broad terms about wanting to bridge the education spending gap in his Jan. 20 inaugural speech. \"Our state will never be as strong as it needs to be if some schools have all the resources they need and other schools are cutting band and football to just to keep the lights on,\" he said.

remember when we built the astrodome, roy hofheinz told us we were giving the city a gift that would bless us for generations? now i read that we still owe up to $32 million, which will take 22 years to pay off, all while we pay $2 million more a year in maintenance (not allowing for inflation). you do the math. seems to me like we gave ourselves the gift that keeps on taking. how about we follow dallas' lead and just blow it up? we could sell lottery tickets to push the button. might even make enough to retire the debt. i'd pay 10 bucks for a chance to do it. hopefully the astrodome is now one step closer to its final destiny: being converted into a much-needed multilevel parking garage at reliant park. the outer shell should retain the familiar dome look that we all have become accustomed to seeing over the past 40-plus years. but the interior should be converted into multilevel parking with six to eight entrances spaced around the perimeter. the parking fees collected would fully pay for this conversion, and we would still have our beloved astrodome to view. we are about to build still another new stadium and saddle the taxpayers with a big part of the bill. yet in our city sits a beautiful stadium, billed as the eighth wonder of the world, and it is vacant. well, duh! why can't the dynamo work out a deal to use this great facility instead of building still another playpen for athletes? in addition to saving money, there would be a prestige factor in claiming the dome as a home. an alternative looms in the future, which is to eventually tear down this great facility because it costs too much to sit there vacant. i don't think anyone in this city wants this to happen. i truly wish that good common sense would prevail among the decision-makers. someone, please, exercise some leadership and lead the way toward making this happen. regarding your article about the outstanding debt on the long-vacant astrodome (another example of government mismanagement), perhaps a mere 32 of all those famous athletes who benefited greatly from their taxpayer-funded playground might consider a little public service and each kick in a million dollars apiece or so to pay off the debt. nah...never happen. it appears that after all these years and all those tragic deaths, the houston police department is still sending lone officers to deal with family disturbances (\"police: officer shoots man holding knife; officials say suspect held it to woman's throat\" (page b1, friday). the headline could have been much different. too many times officers have been killed or seriously injured at such events. one of the first things my training officer told me was, \"when you break up a fight, you frequently have to fight two people .\" to continue sending lone officers to such calls is dangerous. <mark>robert martin</mark>, retired hpd lieutenant, montgomery in \"some cross bridge to 21st century; others\" just say no' \"(page b9, april 7), thomas friedman makes two main errors. first, he assigns to president george w. bush the legacy of the reagan trifecta of\" tax cuts, deregulation and government-as-the-problem-not-the-solution. \"in truth, president <mark>bush</mark> met only one of the three - one short of even the meatloaf standard of success. under <mark>bush</mark>, not only did regulation increase (even in the financial sector - remember sarbanes-oxley?) but domestic discretionary spending increased at nearly double the level that it did under president clinton. second, he states that government should be\" incentivizing businesses to build their next factory in this country, \"implying that it is the government that should lead the way in deciding where we should invest in the future, using subsidies and special benefits to guide innovation. unfortunately, government tends to use such interventions to protect favored corporations from competition and to set up benefits for favored special interests. friedman is asking for politicians, acting on the incentive of being re-elected, to somehow predict the future and direct future innovation in areas in which they have limited knowledge and expertise. we've seen the result when we expect government to lead the way in\" building bridges \": we get a bridge to nowhere. comments readers are solely responsible for the content of the comments they post here. comments are subject to the site's about our ads copyright \u00a9 2010 the houston chronicle"}, {"articleID": "2018090412_00278714_W", "names": {"Nicola Mclean": ["Q7029075", "Q7029076"], "Jamie O'Hara": ["Q1429719", "Q470340"], "John Partridge": ["Q23680943", "Q454634", "Q51584622"], "Stephanie Davis": ["Q6134141", "Q7608260"]}, "date": "2018-09-04", "url": "http://heatworld.com/entertainment/tv-movies/coleen-nolan-kim-woodburn-interview/", "content": "Coleen Nolan breaks down over her confrontation with Kim Woodburn on This Morning Coleen Nolan breaks down over her confrontation with Kim Woodburn on This Morning by Emma Dodds | 54 mins ago \u00a9 Coleen Nolan & Kim Woodburn \u00a9 Shutterstock They tried to make amends last week Coleen Nolan had a well-publicised feud with celebrity cleaner Kim Woodburn when they were in the Celebrity Big Brother house together in January 2017.

She told Big Brother in the Diary Room that he was the type of scum you wash down the sink. We probably won't be booking her in to clean up our gaff anytime soon, TBH. Channel 4 Perez Hilton It takes a big character to get under Katie Hopkins' skin, and Perez Hilton fitted the bill perfectly. He went so far in arguments that he actually cracked Katie and was labelled a \"bully' by viewers. Some of his other attention-seeking moments included threatening Calum Best, comparing the experience in the house to serious illnesses and running around stripping. He clearly LOVED annoying people. Channel 4 Gemma Collins Ah, The GC had MANY an outrageous moment during her time in the CBB house. Her biggest feud seemed to be with the Big Brother system, refusing to take part in challenges and telling them she doesn't need the fee money to pay her mortgage (\"I'VE GOT MONEY!\" ).

Against a New York Yankees team that led MLB in home runs and was second in runs scored, Terry Francona picked his third-best starting pitcher for Game 1. Wait, what?\" Trust in Tito \"is now as much a part of the Northeast Ohio sports dialogue as\" Strive for greatness \"and (choose the phrase you most often yell at the TV during Browns games). But the Bauer move seemed as if the Tribe was getting a little too cute, considering the opponent and stakes. What the heck do we know? Bauer threw 6 2/3 shutout innings Thursday night in Game 1 of the American League Division Series, the Indians posted their sixth shutout victory in 16 postseason games dating back to last year, and Kluber will take the mound Friday night, when a win would put the Tribe one victory short of back-to-back ALCS appearances for the first time in 19 years. Basically, Thursday was a continuation of a theme that started last July, and hasn't really stopped. Francona, Chris Antonetti and <mark>Mike Chernoff</mark> can do almost no wrong--even in a sport that can be more odd than some of Bauer's past interview sessions. Since July 27, Bauer is 10-1 with a 2.23 ERA and 1.15 WHIP. He's allowing 8.2 hits and 2.1 walks per nine innings (down from his respective season norms of 9.2 and 3.1), and he's struck out 93 batters in 84 2/3 frames. In three starts against the Yankees in 2017, he's 3-0 with a 0.92 ERA and 19 Ks in 19 2/3 innings. He's yielding only 5.9 hits per nine against a lineup that also finished in the top five in MLB in on-base percentage, slugging and OPS. Thursday night, only four of the 23 batters Bauer faced reached base, and he faced only three over the minimum in recording 20 outs. He got a boost from an incredible catch by Jason Kipnis on a line drive to center field by Chase Headley to lead off the third inning. Kipnis, a two-time All-Star, was moved from second base to center for 11 regular-season games in another\" wait, what? \"move by Francona that now looks brilliant. And just as <mark>Andrew Miller</mark>--the Tribe's prized acquisition at the 2016 trade deadline--did last October, the front office's big summer move looked even better in Game 1. Jay Bruce--acquired from the Reds in August, after the Indians beat out the Yankees in the bidding because they, unlike the Bronx Bombers, were willing to take on the $4 million that remained on the outfielder's contract--doubled, homered and hit a sacrifice fly in his first three trips to the plate. Bruce was acquired for Ryder Ryan, a 30th-round draft pick by the Indians in 2016 who spent the entire 2017 campaign in Single-A. He's 22 and has a 4.07 ERA and 1.40 WHIP in two years down on the farm. Maybe Ryan will end up being an effective reliever. It doesn't matter, though. Bruce was the piece the banged-up Indians desperately needed at the time, and with Michael Brantley on the roster only as a pinch hitter, he's every bit as crucial in the postseason. Thursday night, it was as if every big decision was on display. And again, the Tribe's decision-makers hit it out of the park. Do you have MLB Network?

Game 2 of the Indians-Yankees series is the second of two exclusive postseason broadcasts by MLB Network. Baseball's signature channel, as this Sports TV Ratings piece outlines, is in about 62.4 million homes. That's almost 23 million below FS1 (85.3 million) is 25.3 million fewer than ESPN (87.5 million). MLB sent out a news release this week that Thursday's Astros-Red Sox and Friday's Indians-Yankees games on MLB Network would also be available via free preview for customers of Armstrong, Cablevision (Optimum), Comcast (XFINITY), Cox, DISH, Fidelity, Frontier, Grande, GVTC, Mid-Hudson Cable, Norwood Light Broadband, RCN and Verizon FiOS. MLB partnered with those providers for an eight-day free preview that runs until Oct. 11. That, however, isn't enough to cover all of the fans whose providers don't have MLB Network. Again, we recommend you check, and soon. Cavs strike contract with iHeart just in time The Cavs and Lake Erie Monsters announced a radio deal with iHeartMedia Cleveland on Thursday, and it turns out, it really went down to the wire. The NBA team and the American Hockey League club struck multiyear agreements with iHeart, which means WTAM-AM, 1100, and WMMS-FM, 100.7, will remain the flagship stations of the Cavs. After the deal was made public, a source told Crain's that the previous agreement was expiring prior to the 2017-18 season. That's a moot point now, as the two Cleveland stations will power the 30-station Cavs Radio Network, which the release says\" reaches 38 states and half of Canada. \"It also means WMMS-HD2, 99.1 FM, remains the Monsters' radio home. The station will air all 76 regular-season broadcasts for the second consecutive year. The Cavs also announced that they reached an extension with Murray Hill Broadcasting's 87.7 FM La Mega to continue the team's Spanish radio broadcasts, which are led by play-by-play voice Rafael Hernandez Brito. This will be Year 7 with <mark>John Michael</mark> as the radio voice on the Cavs Radio Network, and Jim Chones will be in his eighth season as the color analyst. <mark>Mike</mark> Snyder, in Year 26, will anchor the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage."}, {"articleID": "2010032606_00105035_W", "names": {"Michael Hanna": ["Q16090306", "Q20876911", "Q27020822"]}, "date": "2010-03-26", "url": "http://boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2010/03/26/iraqs_tight_race_brings_warnings_on_violence/", "content": "iraq's tight race brings warnings on violence by adam schreck associated press / march 26, 2010 e-mail this article to: invalid e-mail address add a personal message: (80 character limit) your e-mail: invalid e-mail address sending your article your article has been sent. e-mail | print | reprints | | text size - + baghdad - iraqi election results today will probably show a virtual tie between the two top vote-getting blocs led by the prime minister and his chief rival, a political equation that could add up to bitter political wrangling and risk reigniting violence. prime minister nouri al-maliki, a shi'ite who enjoys wide support with the shi'ite majority, is neck and neck with former prime minister ayad allawi, who is popular with iraq's sunni minority. if neither camp emerges with a clear mandate, many fear a drawn-out political debate to form a government could spill over into violence and complicate american efforts to speed up troop withdrawals in the coming months. interior minister jawad al-bolani, himself a candidate, called on iraq's electoral commission to hold off releasing the tally today because he fears the political rivalries could erupt into violence. that concern has been echoed by many members of maliki's state of law coalition, who say they fear the shi'ite majority could react in outrage if they feel the results aren't what they expect. such pronouncements are likely to reflect political posturing. election officials have dismissed calls for a further delay or a recount of the returns from the march 7 vote. many iraqis fear a return to violence between the sunni and shi'ite factions amid the horse-trading that will ramp up in earnest once all of the results are made public. maliki's coalition has drawn much of its support from the shi'ite majority, and his attempts to appeal to sunnis were undercut by his support for a ban on many sunni candidates for alleged ties to saddam hussein's regime. the sunnis largely threw their support behind allawi's iraqiya bloc, which although headed by a shi'ite, has billed itself as secular. iraq's kurdish faction sees itself as a key electoral kingmaker, though followers of radical anti-us shi'ite cleric moqtada al-sadr could also play a pivotal role after garnering a significant number of seats. \"everybody's talking to everybody,\" said <mark>michael hanna</mark>, an iraq analyst with the century foundation. \"none of these governments make a whole lot of sense in terms of consistent ideologies...it's all about wielding power .\" \u00a9 copyright 2010 globe newspaper company."}, {"articleID": "2015022506_00008121_W", "names": {"Joseph Kahn": ["Q1363428", "Q6284490"]}, "date": "2015-02-25", "url": "http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/power-rangers-film-reaction", "content": "LOS ANGELES - Jason David Frank, who was cast as Tommy Oliver a.k.a. the original Green Ranger for the Power Rangers series in 1993, reacted unfavorably to Tuesday's release of a twisted 14-minute short film based on the Power Rangers franchise.

JASON DAVID FRANK - Official Fan Page. For the uninitiated, the Power Rangers are high school students who are given superpowers to defeat bad guys from destroying Earth. The TV series from 1993 has since catapulted into an international brand fueled by clothes, games, comic books and toys. But <mark>Kahn</mark>'s morbid version, with a cackling twist at the end, puts the Power Rangers in more grown-up situations filled with drugs, murder and mysterious connections. Lionsgate and Saban Brands, which owns the rights to the Mighty Morphin Power Ranger s franchise, plan to \"re-envision\" the fighters of evil for the silver screen in <mark>Kahn</mark> is facing pressure from Saban Brands to take down his short film, which has already been removed from Vimeo.

In 1994, the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) removed the show from the air due to the number of complaints from concerned parents who were thought the show taught kids to solve their problems with violence. 4. The show is heavily edited for Malaysian TV because censors think it will get kids addicted to drugs. Malaysian censors think \"Morphin\" is too close to \"morphine\". Bryan Cranston did some voice acting in the early 90s. 6. The character Tommy Oliver has been six different types of Ranger. The Green Ranger, White Ranger, White Ninja Ranger, Red Zeo Ranger, Red Turbo Ranger and the Black Dino Thunder Ranger. 7. In the original Japanese series, the Yellow Ranger is a man.

Actor Walter Emanuel Jones lost one of his fingers in a childhood accident. 9. The original Blue Ranger quit the show due to harassment. 10. Power Rangers has been on the air for 20 years.
