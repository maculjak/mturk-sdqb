The company, which is currently in partnership with Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Petroleum to build a $500-million oil-blending plant on Waltham Park Road in Kingston, also has its eyes on exporting products to the French-speaking Caribbean country Haiti. In a series of Jamaica Promotions Corporation (Jampro) - organised tours recently, top representatives from Cuba's largest manufacturing groups and companies--including Imeco, Quimimport, Coralsa and CubaSol--were hosted at Paramount's plant on East Bell Road in Kingston. Members of the delegation, including commercial attach\u00e9 at the Cuban Embassy, Jorg\u00e9 Sanchez, were also given a tour of the company's Waltham Park Road lubricant facility set to open in September. In a telephone interview with the Jamaica Observer yesterday, managing director of Paramount Trading, <mark>Hugh Graham</mark>, reckons that now is a good time for companies like Paramount and to a greater extent, Jamaica, to secure contracts with businesses in Cuba. \"The interesting thing about Cuba is that since they seem to be on the verge of opening up, we would want to get in there early because when they do open up, you will have the big companies from America that will come in. So I'm thinking that the first mover advantage would work well for us,\" he said. <mark>Graham</mark> noted that with volume demands three times that of Jamaica, signing off on supplier contracts with the Cuban manufacturers would be \"icing on the cake\" for the company. Paramount currently operates five business units, including its chemical products arm which deals in food and industrial products, the distribution of SIKA-branded products, manufacturing of commercial cleaning agents, haulage services and lubricants business. According to <mark>Graham</mark>, the delegates have shown particular interest in the Altra brand of lubricant for which the company has jointly partnered with Allegheny on producing. \"They displayed other interest in our baking soda from the food side of the business. We have a low sodium baking powder that works well with diabetics because the sodium content is lower than the regular baking powder,\" he told the Caribbean Business Report. In an effort to encourage relationships and business partnerships between Cuba and Jamaica, Jampro spearheaded another meeting with the companies yesterday aimed at determining the specific needs of each business. Paramount anticipates fulfilling the demand of the Cuban manufacturers if it secures a contract, given the planned opening of its lubricant facility later this year. The managing director is also of the view that the company will be able to successfully compete against industry giants in both Cuba and Haiti, given the importation tax relief for local companies manufacturing goods on the island. \"The competitive advantage of manufacturers here in Jamaica is that you don't pay the duties on the raw material that goes in manufacturing in the same way you pay the duties on the finished product .\" So this will certainly make us competitive as it relates to not having to pass that cost on to customers, which is almost 50 per cent duty, \"he said.

President Donald Trump has sent a flurry of mixed messages, raising questions about the White House strategy on health care. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) In a statement on Monday, Gov. John Kasich says Republicans and Democrats should work together openly to address the failings of the Obama health law and come up with a bipartisan solution. Kasich, who sought the GOP presidential nomination last year, said the American people will come out on the losing end if Republicans try to force a vote without open dialogue and transparency. Kasich's comments add pressure to Ohio's Republican senator, Rob Portman, ahead of the vote. ___ 9:30 a.m. President Donald Trump has a message for Republican lawmakers deliberating the latest proposed health care bill: this is your last chance.

The White House remains adamant that a path to passing the bill remains, but concedes that the longer the process drag on, the harder it will be to move the bill forward. ___ 3:10 a.m.. The Senate will move forward with a key vote this week on a Republican health bill but it's a mystery what exactly they will be voting on. It's not yet known whether the legislation will seek to replace President Barack Obama's health care law or simply repeal it. Sen. <mark>John Thune</mark> of South Dakota says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will make a decision soon on which bill to bring up for a vote, depending on ongoing discussions with GOP senators. <mark>Thune</mark> sought to cast this week's initial vote as important but mostly procedural, allowing senators to begin debate and propose amendments. But he acknowledged senators should be able to know beforehand what bill they will be considering. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
