A Mercedes spokesman said technical director <mark>James Allison</mark> will be the most senior team member at the track in the Austrian's absence. \"With both championships secured, it gives me more time in Europe to focus on other open topics,\" Wolff said in a team preview of the season's penultimate race at Sao Paulo's Interlagos track. \"It's great to be able to do this and to know that the team will represent the three-pointed star in the best way possible both on and off the track .\" <mark>Lewis Hamilton</mark> won his sixth world championship when he finished second to team mate Valtteri Bottas in Austin, Texas, on Nov. 3 after the team sealed the constructors' championship in Japan on Oct. 13.

The Briton has 83 career wins and is closing in on <mark>Michael Schumacher</mark>'s all-time record of 91. The 34-year-old won in Brazil last year, while Mercedes wrapped up the constructors' championship there. With both titles secure, and the top three positions in the constructors' standings locked in, Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull will also be using the last two races to test ideas for next season. \"Despite this record-breaking achievement, I still feel a lot of hunger and desire for more achievements,\" said Wolff. \"There's no sense of complacency, everybody is still determined to keep on improving...we have two races to go in the 2019 season and we want to end this season on a high .\" The last race is in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 1 (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "articleID": "2019111120_00004098_W", "names": {"Michael Schumacher": ["Q1929281", "Q19707089", "Q9671"]}}, {"date": "2019-11-11", "url": "https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/gadsden-county-man-was-apart-of-first-class-of-all-black-marines-in-u-s", "content": "Gadsden County man was apart of first class of all black Marines in U.S. Posted: 6:38 PM, Nov 11, 2019 Updated: 2019-11-11 18:38:50 -05 GADSDEN COUNTY, Fla.--A Gadsden County man was in the first class of all black Marines in the United States.

(AP)--Federal authorities will coordinate with state and local law enforcement officers to crack down on violence in cities with high crime rates in the coming months after arresting hundreds of fugitives under a program underway nationwide, U.S. Attorney General <mark>William Barr</mark> said Tuesday. <mark>Barr</mark>'s announcement came as he joined other federal authorities and about 30 state and local law enforcement agents in New Mexico following the recent arrests of 330 fugitives in the state. The arrests had resulted from an initiative known as Operation Triple Beam, a U.S. Marshal-led program that began in 2011, officials said. <mark>Barr</mark> said a push in the past two years to increase arrests under the program had paved the way for more federal crime-fighting efforts that would see a boost in the coming weeks. He did not elaborate or say which cities would be targeted during a news conference in Albuquerque, where he said violent crime rates \"remain stubbornly high\" in comparison to the rest of the country. \"I don't think it's a secret to anyone here that New Mexico generally and Albuquerque specifically are experiencing a violent crime crisis,\" <mark>Barr</mark> said. The state has long struggled to overcome persistently high crime rates, which it has tried to curb with state law enforcement units deployed to arrest fugitives. Lawmakers also have pushed a range of reform measures, including a bill that called for more inmates to be enrolled in Medicaid so they have better access to drug and mental health treatment options after their release. The most recent FBI figures show New Mexico had the nation's second highest violent crime rate and its highest property crime rate last year. That's despite Albuquerque reporting a slight decrease in both categories for the first time in years. Crime in New Mexico's largest city accounted for more than half the state's crime overall. The data offers a broad look at crime in thousands of U.S. cities but can be inconsistent and incomplete. Jessie Damazyn, a spokeswoman for Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, a Democrat, did not comment directly on <mark>Barr</mark>'s visit in an email to The Associated Press. But she said the public safety mandate among community members called for long-term partnerships and more community policing, which typically calls for officers to spend enough time in specific neighborhoods to become a familiar and trusted face among residents. \"It takes all of us working together with our community to fight violent crime,\" said Jessie Damazyn, a spokeswoman for Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller. At the news conference, <mark>Barr</mark> called the state's criminal justice system \"subpar,\" which he blamed on policies that give judges broad discretion over whether to detain suspects awaiting trial. Bennett Bauer, the state's chief public defender, said he has seen no evidence that the state's pretrial release system has spurred more crime in the state. He added that <mark>Barr</mark>'s criticism amounted to a \"blame game\" on judges. \"If the feds really want to help our communities, they should stick around and help fund solutions to the problems underlying crime,\" said Bennett Bauer, the state's chief public defender. \"Help us provide more drug treatment, education, jobs and rehabilitation in our prison system .\" Of the 330 arrests in New Mexico, 10 of the suspects were wanted in homicide cases and 50 faced assault charges, the Justice Department said. About 90 of those arrested were wanted on drug charges, and about 56 pounds of methamphetamine and other drugs were seized. In the past year, federal authorities also touted arrests, and gun and drug seizures under the program in Salinas, California; Phoenix; Tucson, Arizona; and Lawrence, Massachusetts. In New Mexico, the arrests resulted from a three-month operation. <mark>Barr</mark>'s visit follows Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's recent announcement that a special state law enforcement unit would renew efforts to find fugitives. The unit's seven state police officers and seven corrections officers are expected to help reduce the 1,600 warrants for people linked to violent crimes in New Mexico. Bernalillo County Sheriff Manuel Gonzales said he welcomed the help fighting crime. His office assigned 100 officers--a third of its force--to assist with Operation Triple Beam, officials said. \"We're not done,\" he said. \"This is just the start .\" Most Popular 1 Anguillan authorities prepare arrest warrant for \"fugitive' Scott Hapgood 2 Worker killed in SoNo Collection construction accident 3 37 pounds of pot seized in two busts in Stamford 4 Attorney: Scott Hapgood\" cannot clear his name if he is dead' 5 Support flows in for gymnast fatally injured in training 6 Police: Man charged with smashing bottle over head of Stamford man 7 Regis Philbin selling Greenwich mansion at a substantial loss View Comments \u00a9 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc. .", "articleID": "2019111302_00027141_W", "names": {"William Barr": ["Q16683338", "Q43123958", "Q43911234", "Q8005104"]}}, {"date": "2019-11-13", "url": "https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/13/raheem-behaved-like-a-child-more-details-on-gomez-sterling-england-bust-up-revealed-ahead-of-montenegro-qualifier/", "content": "Lorenzo Mart\u00edn November 13, 2019 A lot has been made of <mark>Joe Gomez</mark> and Raheem Sterling's bust-up whilst on England duty lately, and now, it seems even more details on the incident have revealed by certain sources. <mark>Gomez</mark> and Sterling's beef seemed to start during Liverpool's 3-1 win over Man City on Sunday, after the two squared up with one another following a challenge by <mark>Gomez</mark> on Sterling.

Recent Business Highlights Ping Identity recently secured a notable customer win with a large global entertainment and ticketing platform, which purchased and is implementing Ping Identity's hybrid cloud platform to replace a homegrown solution. This is a core part of the enterprise's digital transformation strategy to establish a more personalized relationship with their customers and a better user experience for event access. Ping Identity closed the largest PingIntelligence for APIs deal in company history at over $500,000 in ARR, driving further innovation around API security. The Company's industry leadership and accomplishments have been validated recently by the likes of Gartner, KuppingerCole, InfoSec, and CRN. For example, Ping Identity currently scores 92% on \"Willingness to Recommend' by Gartner Peer Insights and was positioned as a Leader in Gartner's August 2019 Magic Quadrant for Access Management. Ping Identity hosted Identify conferences in Chicago, New York, Europe and Asia Pacific, and announced the launch of PingCentral to help customers automate centralized identity services. Ping Identity is now a NYSE-listed company (ticker symbol: PING) after completing its IPO on September 19, raising $187.5 million. The majority of net proceeds were subsequently used to pay down debt .\" We are pleased with our strong third quarter performance, driven by our continued leadership position in the enterprise market due to the flexibility of our platform and our ability to address multi-generational IT realities, \"stated Raj Dani, Chief Financial Officer of Ping Identity .\" Total ARR grew 23% versus the prior year period, which we believe provides the best representation of the underlying health of the business. We've also been able to effectively balance our commitment to invest in growth and innovation with profitability by delivering operating efficiencies that have resulted in a net loss improvement from $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2018 to a net loss of $0.6 million this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 22% in the quarter, and year-to-date cash flows from operations as well as Unlevered Free Cash Flow were positive. We believe there are significant whitespace opportunities within our existing customer base by adding identities and use cases and selling new solutions, as we further penetrate an overall $25 billion market opportunity for Identity Access Management software and hybrid cloud solutions. \"Fourth Quarter Financial Outlook Ping Identity provides the following expected financial guidance for the quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2019: Quarter Ending December 31, 2019: Total ARR of $222.1 million to $223.1 million Total Revenue of $64.7 million to $66.7 million Unlevered Free Cash Flow of $(11.9) million to $(10.8) million Year Ending December 31, 2019: Total ARR of $222.1 million to $223.1 million Total Revenue of $239.3 million to $241.3 million Unlevered Free Cash Flow of $(3.8) million to $(2.7) million, inclusive of contingent deal consideration in the amount of $4.9 million Conference Call Details In conjunction with this announcement, Ping Identity will host a conference call today, November 13, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to Ping Identity's results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\" ), the Company believes the following non-GAAP measures presented in this press release and discussed on the related teleconference call are useful in evaluating its operating performance: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, unlevered free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA.

Stephen Waterson, 26, reversed the seat of his Audi convertible, squashing his girlfriend's young son in the footwell on February 1 last year. He then orchestrated a\" campaign of lies \", even threatening to make witnesses\" disappear \"to avoid responsibility for Alfie's death. The toddler's aunt, Ashleigh Jeffery, eventually broke the wall of silence and recorded Alfie's mother revealing what really happened. A jury had failed to reach a verdict in Waterson's trial and he pleaded guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in September ahead of his retrial. On Thursday, Mr Justice Kerr sentenced Waterson to seven-and-a-half years for manslaughter, plotting to pervert the course of justice and intimidating witness Marcus Lamb. The judge said:\" I do not find you were annoyed with Alfie and moved your seat back because of that annoyance. \"\"Nevertheless, I am satisfied so that I am sure on the evidence I heard at the trial that albeit not in anger but for your own comfort, you moved the car seat back twice and not only once .\" Stephen Waterson crushed three-year-old Alfie Lamb to death with his car seat (Metropolitan Police/PA) He accepted character references from the defendant's father, the former minister Nigel Waterson and his wife Barbara, who attended court, and agreed he was \"not all bad\". But he said Waterson had been \"cunning, manipulative, dishonest, disloyal, deceitful, threatening, controlling and sometimes violent\". Earlier this year, Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, 24, from Gravesend in Kent, was jailed for two years and nine months for child cruelty and her part in the conspiracy. Pregnant barmaid Emilie Williams, 20, had admitted lying to police and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 100 hours of unpaid work. On the cover-up, Mr Justice Kerr told Waterson: \"You orchestrated the campaign of lies, assisted by Ms Hoare who had the misfortune to fall in love with you and was willing to lie to protect you and herself .\" When the conspiracy began to falter in the second half of February 2018 under pressure from a very brave young woman, Ms Ashleigh Jeffery, you resorted to threats of violence, saying you could make people disappear. \"Alfie's mother Adrian Hoare was\" unlucky enough to fall in love' with Waterson and was caught up in the lies. (Met Police/PA) Speaking outside court, Ms Jeffery told how the family had been \"utterly devastated\" by the death of \"a very happy three-year-old boy with his whole life ahead of him\". She said: \"The tragic circumstances surrounding his death is something we will never come to terms with .\" No sentence will ever be enough, but today we finally gave Alfie a voice and justice has prevailed. \"In a victim impact statement, she also said Waterson's guilty plea had been\" like a huge weight had been lifted \". Ms Jeffery, who had given key evidence in court, said:\" He could have avoided so much more upset in people's lives had he just owned up in the beginning. \"\"Justice has prevailed' Alfie's aunt Ashleigh Jeffery speaking outside the Old Bailey in London (Kirsty O\u2019Connor / PA) Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding described Waterson as a\" very arrogant, selfish, controlling and manipulative man \". He said:\" He knew what happened. He tried to put my officers off the scent from the word go. \"He paid tribute to Ms Jeffery, saying she had been\" incredibly strong and brave \"in her determination to find out what happened and\" changed the course of the investigation \". It is the first time anyone in the UK has died from crush asphyxiation as a result of an electronic car seat, police said. Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare with Alfie Lamb were caught on CCTV during a shopping trip to Sutton on the day he died (Metropolitan Police/PA) Waterson and Hoare had gone shopping for cushions in Sutton, south London, accompanied by Alfie, Williams, Marcus Lamb, 22, and another young child. Nightclub worker Waterson wanted to stretch his legs out and twice moved his front passenger seat into Alfie as he sat at his mother's feet, jurors heard. By the time they arrived at Waterson's home in Croydon, the little boy had collapsed and he died from crush asphyxia three days later. Nigel Waterson and Barbara Judge, parents of adopted Stephen Waterson, remained tight-lipped after their son Stephen was sentenced at the Old Bailey (Kirsty O\u2019Connor / PA) In mitigation for Waterson, Tana Adkin QC told the court:\" Whilst thoughtless, I have no doubt, and selfish in his behaviour on February 1, he was not deliberately malevolent and nasty towards Alfie. \"Waterson's father Nigel Waterson was first elected MP for Eastbourne in 1992 and was a junior minister in <mark>John Major</mark>'s government, but was defeated by Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd at the 2010 general election.", "articleID": "2019111417_00108670_W", "names": {"John Major": ["Q27957644", "Q47546458", "Q9559"]}}, {"date": "2019-11-14", "url": "http://romseyadvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/18037946.sterling-supports-gomez-england-defender-booed-wembley-fans/", "content": "Sterling supports <mark>Gomez</mark> after England defender booed by Wembley fans By Press Association 2019 <mark>Joe Gomez</mark> came off the bench for England 0 comment Raheem Sterling has criticised England fans who booed <mark>Joe Gomez</mark> during the 7-0 rout of Montenegro at Wembley.

Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. The impeachment inquiry into the behavior of President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> has reached a public phase, giving the American people their first chance to reach their own judgments. Two witnesses testified Wednesday before a House panel, including one who told of a cellphone call during which the president allegedly pushed to use America's national security apparatus to do his own political dirty work. Eight other witnesses have been scheduled. These include the U.S. diplomat on that call with <mark>Trump</mark>, at least one other person at the table listening in, and a decorated Army officer working for the National Security Council. But many others aren't coming because the <mark>Trump</mark> administration is engaged in what could only be categorized as stonewalling. Undercutting House Republicans The White House's refusal to provide witnesses, as well as much needed documentation, for a legitimate and serious congressional inquiry accomplishes little but undercut efforts by Republicans to come to <mark>Trump</mark>'s aid. One of the few coherent arguments that GOP lawmakers could make Wednesday was that the witnesses were sometimes providing secondhand or thirdhand information. All the more reason, then, to go to the source. But several of the key witnesses, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser <mark>John Bolton</mark>, are balking. The rationale for the stonewalling is supposedly laid out in a letter White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent to Congress last month. The \"due process\" argument in that letter, however, has been superseded by events. A vote to authorize the inquiry has been taken, and once-private proceedings are now public. Much of the rest of the rationale is baffling, unsupported or circular in logic. It declares the inquiry to be invalid because testimony provided by credible witnesses under oath consists of \"falsehoods and misinformation .\" It declares that Democrats fear they will lose the next election. And it throws in references to the Framers and the Constitution much like a high school student might do in hopes of getting a passing grade on an otherwise incomprehensible term paper. Refusal could equal impeachable Surely, if <mark>Trump</mark>'s July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president was as \"perfect\" as the president says, the administration would want to tell its side of the story. Topping the list of people who should want to come forward is Mulvaney, who last month publicly affirmed that <mark>Trump</mark> had conditioned security aid to Ukraine on the announcement of a public investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. \"I have news for everybody,\" Mulvaney haughtily declared in the White House briefing room. \"Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy .\" The fact that Mulvaney later tried to walk back his jaw-dropping admission only adds to the urgency of his testimony. <mark>Bolton</mark>, meanwhile, has found time to arrange a book contract and deliver paid speeches. The stonewalling can only contribute to the perception that the administration knows it did wrong and is trying to hide that fact as much as it can. Ultimately, refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas might itself be impeachable conduct. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Listen to qualifying on 5 Live Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website from 18:15 GMT on Saturday Sebastian Vettel led Charles Leclerc to a Ferrari one-two in an incident-packed second practice session at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The German was 0.021 seconds ahead of Leclerc with Red Bull's <mark>Max Verstappen</mark> third, ahead of Mercedes drivers Valtteri Bottas and <mark>Lewis Hamilton</mark>. Williams driver Robert Kubica began the session with a heavy crash at Turn Three from which he emerged unscathed. Both Toro Rossos suffered reliability problems, stopping on track. The session ran in cloudy but grey conditions after the wet weather for the morning session, but Kubica appeared to be caught out by dampness on a painted white line when he spun at the fast Turn Three on his first flying lap of the day. Brazilian Grand Prix first and second practice results <mark>Hamilton</mark> to negotiate new F1 contract Albon named Red Bull second driver for 2020 View more on twitter The Pole, whose Williams had been used by reserve driver Nicholas Latifi in the first session, lost the rear, over-corrected and spun into the wall, badly damaging three corners of the car. It was another blow for Williams, who have been struggling for pace all year and in recent races have been suffering from a shortage of spare parts. At the front, the true competitive order is hard to read, as both Ferrari drivers and <mark>Hamilton</mark> had messy runs. Vettel and <mark>Hamilton</mark> were both blocked by Bottas on their fastest laps, the world champion on the exit of Mergulho, the penultimate corner, and Vettel shortly afterwards on the exit of Juncao, just a few metres further on. And Leclerc did not improve in the final sector of his fastest lap, which suggests he, too, had more time in him. <mark>Verstappen</mark> impressed to be just 0.134 secs off the pace as Red Bull's revival in the last few races continues, and Bottas was 0.156 secs behind Vettel. The compromised <mark>Hamilton</mark> - whose time, like Vettel's, was set on his second lap on his tyres - was 0.067 secs behind his team-mate. Media playback is not supported on this device Jack Nicholls: \"Why <mark>Hamilton</mark> is better than Senna & Schumacher' Ferrari may well see the results of the session as vindication after what they consider to be unfounded allegations about their engine in the wake of two rule clarifications from governing body the FIA. Ferrari insist neither ruling - one governing the operation of the hybrid system and fuel-flow meter, and the other the addition of oil into the combustion chamber - have any effect on the running of their engine. They said they would be back to their normal form in Brazil after a disappointing race in the US last time out, and at least on Friday they look to be favourites for pole position on Saturday. Best of the rest was Kevin Magnussen's Haas, for once not struggling with tyre temperature in a disappointing season for the American team, followed by the Renault of Daniel Ricciardo and Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen. The second Red Bull driver Alexander Albon, confirmed with the team for 2020 earlier this week, was struggling after a crash at the end of the first session and down in ninth place, 0.9 secs off team-mate <mark>Verstappen</mark>. At Toro Rosso, Pierre Gasly's engine failed mid-way through the session forcing the Frenchman to park up at Turn Three, while Daniil Kvyat went off at Juncao, the final corner, with five minutes to go, after his car switched off, causing him to spin lightly into the barrier, bringing out the red flag and the session to a premature end. The team said they did not yet know the cause of the problem. McLaren's Lando Norris was down in 18th place, eight places behind team-mate <mark>Carlos Sainz</mark>, but the 20-year-old Briton said he made a series of mistakes .\" I'm confident if I put the lap together and don't make the mistakes I did today, it will look a bit better, \"Norris said .\" It was actually a relatively good day, \"said <mark>Hamilton</mark>.\" The second session was good, nice and smooth. The Ferraris are quite quick today and they were generally beating us just all on the straights. \"<mark>Hamilton</mark> has an Ayrton Senna inspired helmet for this weekend's grand prix Leclerc was 0.021 behind team-mate Vettel", "articleID": "2019111523_00075575_W", "names": {"Andrew Benson": ["Q4756330", "Q57016943"]}}]
