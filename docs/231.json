An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza early on Thursday killed a Palestinian, while a second man died from wounds sustained in last week's mass protest. (Adel Hana / The Associated Press) By Ilan Ben Zion The Associated Press Thu., April 5, 2018 JERUSALEM--An Israeli airstrike killed a Gaza man Thursday, while a second Palestinian died of wounds sustained in last week's mass protest along the Gaza-Israel border, officials said. The deaths brought to 21 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire over the past week, including 15 who had been involved in the protests. The Israeli military said the man killed in the airstrike before dawn Thursday had approached the border fence with an assault rifle. It released a grainy video showing the armed man walking in the dark.

The protest march last week, largely organized by Gaza's Hamas leaders, had been billed as the first of several weeks of intermittent protests against a stifling, decade-old Israeli blockade. Hamas leaders have portrayed the final protest, set for May 15, as the \"Great March of Return\" of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, implying they would try to enter Israeli territory. But they have stopped short of specifically threatening a mass breach of the border fence. The Israeli military has said it will not allow anyone to breach the border fence and has beefed up forces in the area, with snipers and other special units. The military was on high alert ahead of Friday. Nickolay Mladenov, the UN's Mideast envoy, urged both sides to show caution on Friday. \"Israeli forces should exercise maximum restraint and Palestinians should avoid friction at the Gaza fence,\" he said. \"Demonstrations and protests must be allowed to proceed in a peaceful manner,\" he added. \"Civilians, particularly children, must not be intentionally put in danger or targeted in any way .\" Meanwhile, Gaza health officials said a 34-year-old Palestinian who was seriously injured in last week's protests died of his injuries Thursday. Hundreds more were wounded by live fire last week, according to Palestinian health officials. Of the 21 dead so far, 15 were killed during border protests, and videos and witness accounts indicate that most were not armed or carrying out attacks at the moment they were killed. Hamas announced it is distributing money to the families of those killed and wounded in Friday's clashes. Families of those killed receive $3,000 (U.S.). Wounded receive $500 or $200 depending on the injury. Hamas said in a statement the money is part of its \"national and social responsibility in boosting the steadfastness\" of the people. Israel's military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, alleged that Hamas is exploiting Gaza residents by urging them to attend the protests and \"under the cover of these civilians carry out terror activities .\" Manelis said several Israeli communities are close to the Gaza border and warned of the consequences of Palestinians breaching the fence. Israel has defended its actions by saying the marches are planned by Hamas, which is sworn to Israel's destruction. It says the border fence was attacked with burning tires, stones and firebombs and, in one case, by a pair of gunmen in recent days. It says its snipers carefully targeted only the main \"instigators,\" and accuses Hamas of using the crowds as cover to stage attacks. \"By defending the border fence, the IDF (army) is protecting civilian homes,\" the military said on Twitter. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned in a radio interview on Thursday that Israel would respond harshly to any attempt to violate its security. Earlier this week, Lieberman said Gazans who approach the fence would be risking their lives. Rights groups have condemned orders to shoot unarmed protesters as unlawful, saying lethal force can only be used if soldiers face an apparent imminent threat to their lives. The Israeli group B\u2019Tselem, in a rare appeal, urged Israeli soldiers to refuse such orders. The United Nations and the European Union have called for independent investigations into the shootings. Meanwhile, Egyptian intelligence chief <mark>Abbas</mark> Kamel held separate meetings this week with Israeli officials and with Palestinian President <mark>Mahmoud Abbas</mark>, the West Bank-based rival of Hamas, in hopes of preventing an escalation on the Gaza border. In recent months, Egypt had tried to broker a deal that would have enabled <mark>Abbas</mark> to take back control in the Gaza Strip, more than a decade after Hamas seized the territory from forces loyal to him. Hamas, in turn, had hoped that Israel and Egypt would end their blockade of Gaza if the group handed the reins of government to <mark>Abbas</mark>. However, talks broke down last month, in part because Hamas refused to disarm. Hamas and Israel have fought three wars in the Gaza Strip since 2008. <mark>Abbas</mark> told the Egyptian intelligence this week that he would not waste any more time negotiating a deal with Hamas and that he would only assume responsibility for Gaza if Hamas hands over all powers, including control over the security apparatus, according to two Palestinian officials. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the meeting with reporters.

The Inner Harbor restaurant was among 12 Hard Rock Cafe locations selected for the company's \"test kitchen\" program. New items at the Baltimore restaurant became available Tuesday. Local offerings at the Hard Rock Cafe Baltimore include a crab cake sandwich, crab cake entree, crab dip \"Local Legendary Burger\" and a fresh catch of the day. On its drink menu, the restaurant also added a black-eyed Susan cocktail made with Sagamore rye whiskey. <mark>John Galloway</mark>, Hard Rock International's chief marketing officer, said the company began looking for potential test kitchen sites in January, searching for restaurants located in areas with strong \"culinary energy,\" an aptitude for local sourcing, and strong chefs and general managers. Baltimore was among the locations selected from the chain's 176 restaurants. Other Hard Rock test kitchens are in Chicago, Denver and Pittsburgh. Culinary teams at Hard Rock's Orlando headquarters collaborated with chefs in individual markets to develop the new menu items. While the test kitchen items could ultimately end up on Hard Rock's universal menu, the primary goal was adding local flavor to Hard Rock's standard offerings in certain markets.

TROUP (KYTX)--As more and more parents turn to medical marijuana in Colorado to treat their children's debilitating epilepsy, one East Texas family is fighting for a bill that would legalize it here at home. Eight-year-old Jacob Bingham suffers from multiple seizures a day, and his parents are worried medical marijuana may be his only hope. Jacob isn't like most 8-year-olds. He can't talk, ride a bike, eat on his own, or even play with his twin brother .\" He's so worn out from the seizures and from all the drugs that he just doesn't have an interest in much of anything. He just lays around, \"his mother Marcy Bingham said .\" It's hard to live through every day, \"Jacob's brother Jarod said .\" At first the day can just start out as a typical day, and then it all turns into a horrible day if Jacob starts to seize. \"Jacob suffers from Dravet Syndrome, a rare disorder that causes him to have violent and uncontrollable seizures--sometimes dozens a day .\" You can't live a normal life, \"Marcy Bingham said .\" You don't take vacations, you can't leave him with people. Even the nurses at times are uncomfortable with him because he seizes so much. \"The Binghams spent Wednesday in Austin meeting with senators in support of two bills that would legalize cannabis-based oils as a medical treatment for children with severe epilepsy. Senate Bill 339 and House Bill 892 would regulate the growth and dispensation of cannabis-based oils in Texas .\" It's amazing some of the stories we have seen and heard as to how it's helped children similar to our son, \"Jacob's father Dirk Bingham said. Children like 9-year-old Charlotte Figi of Colorado, whose parents credit cannabis-oil for relieving their daughter's constant seizures. The problem the Binghams face is that even if Jacob can get a prescription for the drug in Colorado, he can't legally use it here in Texas .\" We would like that opportunity too, and not worry about being prosecuted if he used it and not having to move to Colorado, \"Marcy Bingham said .\" We both have jobs, we have family here, we've lived here all our lives and we don't want to leave, \"Dirk Bingham said .\" But it may come to that. \"The controversial oil comes from the marijuana plant but it's low in THC and rich in cannabidiol, or CBD, and the Binghams say it's Jacob's last hope .\" If we hadn't tried everything, we wouldn't want to put our child on this, \"Marcy Bingham said .\" But we have tried everything, and there are no more drugs for him. The doctor has told us. \"Right now, Jacob takes up to six pills a day--pills that cause life-threatening side effects .\" He could stop breathing, his heart could stop, his brain could stop and that's it, \"Marcy Bingham said. The Binghams' hope is that Jacob will one day be able to live a normal life .\" Just to say \"mama,' if he could even do that,\" Marcy Bingham said. \"If he could play with his brother. And that's what he says, he has no one to play with. He's an only child basically .\" \"I just want him to at least say just a few words.

hockey's labor dispute moved from multiple unproductive bargaining sessions to multiple legal filings. nhl laid the groundwork in not one but two forums friday, filing a class-action complaint in

to dissolve itself. those moves were anticipated and all about location, location, location. following the lead of the nba's action last year, the lawsuit was filed in u.s. district court in new york, an often-friendly venue to sports leagues and widely known to be pro-employer. the nhl issued a releasethat said, in part, \"by threatening to\" disclaim interest,' the nhlpa has engaged in an

guards stole more than \u00a3 200,000 from car park payment machines at Wythenshawe Hospital, a court heard. Hospital bosses said that the money could have instead been used to save lives, and would have funded six nurses for a year. Now gang leader Peter O'Garro, supervisor Stephen Seddon and security officers Christopher Hughes and Shahid Nadeem have all been jailed. Three women, Elizabeth Seddon, Marie McGovern and Karen O'Garro, all wives or partners of the men, were spared jail after laundering or possessing the stolen money. In a statement read to the court by prosecutors, <mark>Nick Smith</mark>, assistant finance director at the hospital, said: \"This amount represents a significant loss for the hospital and its patients and this money would otherwise have been used to enhance the care we provide to our patients .\" For example, it could have been used to fund the salaries of six fully qualified nurses for a full year or for the purchase of major items of medical equipment or lifesaving drugs. \"Stephen Seddon (Image: MEN) Read more of today's top stories The sentencing judge said the crime was motivated by greed, and described it as\" unforgivable'. Judge Hilary Manley said: \"The money was not stolen from some faceless corporate body, but an NHS hospital trust .\" At a time when it is common knowledge that funding the NHS, a service for all, is beset with difficulties, to steal from it is, many would feel, an unforgivable crime. \"The men were eventually caught out after a new member of staff found out what was going on and reported them. A Manchester Crown Court sentencing hearing heard that between June 2015 and February 2016, the men stole \u00a3 207,412 from six car park machines across the hospital. Read More Drunk thug whose\" shirt was ripped' in mosh pit at Royal Blood gig punched innocent woman in the face Read More Police have told idiots throwing rocks from M60 bridges that the could be done for attempted murder Shahid Nadeem (Image: MEN) Hospital security staff were responsible for collecting the money that was deposited into the machines by members of the public, prosecutor Daniel Calder said. Seddon was the security supervisor, while Nadeem, Hughes and O'Garro were security officers all employed by a private firm on behalf of the hospital. Staff were not supposed to have access to the contents of the boxes of notes and coins inside the machines. Hospital protocol meant that they should have immediately been taken to to the cashiers office, for the money to be counted then banked. Christopher Hughes and Marie McGovern (Image: MEN) They were also supposed to sign an electronic register on a computer spreadsheet, recording who was working and who had signed out the key for a particular payment machine. The hospital's computer system made it possible to show how much cash was paid into each parking machine, how much cash was collected and then how much was deposited and then later banked. This would later help prosecutors catch out the thieves. The court was told that the first theft happened in July 2015 and acted as a \"test run'. A total of \u00a3 1,743.60 was taken from a machine, but never taken to the cashiers office while the key was signed out to Seddon and Hughes. Elizabeth Seddon and Stephen Seddon (Image: MEN) Mr Calder said that after the gang were satisfied that the theft had not been detected, the number of thefts then\" dramatically increased'. In August 2015, \u00a3 24,556.70 was stolen. The highest figure was in September 2015, with a total of \u00a3 39,198. In October 2015, \u00a3 37,895.80 was stolen. Then in November 2015, \u00a3 32,031.70 was taken. In December 2015, \u00a3 20,940.10 was stolen. Into the New Year of January 2016, \u00a3 34,444.30 was stolen. Finally in February 2016, \u00a3 16,601.70 was taken by the gang. Their scam was rumbled when a new temporary member of staff started work in the security team. After being trained about the correct banking procedures, the man quickly realised his colleagues were not working as they should have been. Karen O'Garro (Image: MEN) In September 2015, the man overheard Seddon saying that O'Garro was \"getting greedy'. The following month, he then spotted a large amount of cash in the glove box of the security van being driven by O'Garro. He asked O'Garro about the money, and also took a picture of it. Initially O'Garro reacted angrily, but then said the money was\" for all of us. Ten weeks for us, one week for you'. O'Garro invited his colleague into the conspiracy, but he refused. Later, when the man was speaking with Seddon, the defendant warned him \"if you join us, don't get greedy'. Mr Calder said that Seddon also described O'Garro as\" our main guy'. On another occasion when he was out in the security van with Hughes, there was a number of full cash boxes in the boot. When he asked about them, Hughes replied: \"Don't ask any questions. It's none of your business .\" After leaving his job December 2015, he told the hospital about what he had heard. Wythenshawe Hospital The judge praised him as an \"honest man' who had to put up with\" veiled threats' from the defendants, as they realised he knew what they were up to. In February 2016, police arrested O'Garro, Seddon and Hughes at the hospital's security lodge. From inside O'Garro's Mini Cooper, police recovered more than \u00a3 1,100 in coins. Seddon had \u00a3 650 in cash on his person. At the O'Garro family home in Middleton, \u00a3 4,821.34 in coins were recovered. A total of of \u00a3 16,723.65 in cash was seized at the Seddon family home in Failsworth. At the Wythenshawe home of Hughes and McGovern, \u00a3 4,221.34 in cash was recovered. At Nadeem's Cheetham Hill home, \u00a3 1,981.86 almost entirely in coins was found. Officers discovered evidence that O'Garro and Seddon, the prime movers in the gang, had purchased \"high value' goods including electronics, jewellery and clothes. Further investigations led to Karen O'Garro, Elizabeth Seddon and Marie McGovern being brought before the court. The money stolen could have been used to pay for six nurses, hospital bosses said Mrs O'Garro and Mrs Seddon both laundered money stolen by their husbands. Mrs O'Garro deposited \u00a3 15,996.45 stolen by her husband into four bank accounts in her name. Mrs Seddon put \u00a3 6,140 of the stolen money into her bank account, and a further \u00a3 8,041.52 to a credit card in her name. Ms McGovern stored \u00a3 4,221.34 of stolen money at the address she shared with Hughes. Peter O'Garro, 52, of Sherbourne Road, Middleton, who latterly worked for Virgin Media, was jailed for three years, after pleading guilty to theft. Stephen Seddon, 31, of Samuel Street, Failsworth, who trained to be an electrician after losing his job at the hospital, was jailed for two years and six months after pleading guilty to theft. Christopher Hughes, 53, of Burdale Walk, Wythenshawe, who continues to deny his offending, was jailed for two years and three months after being found guilty of conspiracy to steal. Shahid Nadeem, 39, of Blendworth Close, Cheetham Hill, was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal.
