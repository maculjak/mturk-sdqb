christmas and yet another bitter, sandbox fight to the last word between democrats and republicans on capitol hill that had working folks and poor folks on unemployment biting their nails. this time, it was over the payroll tax cut. late into the pre-christmas week before the remaining members of congress headed back to their districts for gift-wrapping and fundraisers house and senate leaders managed to cobble together a deal. the deal, however, only kicks the schedule up two months from now at a place where frustrated members - only concerned with political optics - will go at it again. remixing oldwashingtonsauce, congressional leaders simply ripped a page from the debt ceiling debate and crafted a senate-picked conference committee that will negotiate the terms of a year-long tax cut after january 1. many house republicans are infuriated by any deal that makes the white house look good. arriving at the point of a bruising fight over a tax cut is perplexing, as well, considering the bizarre nature of the debate. in a rare move engineered to attract independent-minded fiscal conservatives who would have otherwise thought twice about giving president obama a second term, democrats pushed a tax cut. republicans, regardless of how many ways they sliced it and diced it, did not. it was slick political maneuvering. but, hidden deep in the debate over the payroll tax cut is the fate of social security, a program that impacts the 70 million americans who earned it. some hill insiders, exhausted from the back-and-forth indecision, wondered aloud about what constant temporary payroll tax cut \"fixes\" would do to the longer term entitlement. \"forget about kicking the can,\" complained one senior democratic congressional staffer requesting anonymity. \"we might be kicking social security in the gut if we keep it up at this rate. you keep cutting the payroll tax and you might end up having next to nothing to pay for social security .\" payroll taxes, for true, are the primary funding source for social security. interestingly enough, most reports conveniently omit the fact that it's really a \"social security payroll tax .\" this is the tax that, theoretically, is supposed to end up directly in the pockets of retirees. constant cuts to those, the argument rings, could harm social security down the line, particularly if the cuts get longer and more sustained - something worrying many analysts who are watching the debate closely. workers looking for the short term grace of an extra $40 a paycheck may be stunned when retirement approaches to one day find an insolvent and non-existent entitlement. lack of willpower inwashingtonis driven by the greed of reelection in 2012. neither party wants to be the one that is seen as taking money out people's paychecks, which is as simple as the political narrative gets. hence, politically, the white house outwitted and played house republicans in the final analysis. \"senator reid and i have reached an agreement that will ensure taxes do not increase for working families on january 1 while ensuring that a complex new reporting burden is not unintentionally imposed on small business job creators,\" said house speaker john boehner after the deal was reached on thursday afternoon. translated: i don't want anybody pointing fingers at me come election day. \"because of this agreement, every working american will keep his or her tax cut - about $1,000 for the average family?. vital unemployment insurance will continue for millions of americans who are looking for work. and when congress returns, i urge them to keep working to reach an agreement that will extend this tax cut and unemployment insurance for all of 2012 without drama or delay,\" said the president. translated: remember what i just did for you on election day. essentially, both sides use the tax cut as voting pay-to-play, ethereal funny money used to bribe the voter subconscious into thinking they get something for next to nothing. all they have to do is vote for that person in november. but, in the statements and funky platitudes flowing out ofwashington, there is no mention of what this means for social security, the long heralded titan entitlement once thought of as untouchable. yet, in the constant tennis game over debt and deficit, politicians keep biting at the edges of social security, inching closer and closer to its demise or the point where they can comfortably say it's no longer viable - just enough without offending the massive voting bloc that loves it so much. therein lies the problem: social security is too much of a risky long game these days. tax cuts are an easy short sell, money you make at theatlantic cityslots or that bet on the right horse. \"middle-class working families need tax relief to help them survive in this terrible economy,\" sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) conceded earlier in the week, \"but diverting billions of dollars from social security to provide that tax relief is wrong. this continues a dangerous process that began last year. i strongly believe tax relief should be done in a different way .\" sanders, keeping it straight with no chaser, was one of a daring few on capitol hill that attempted to explain the real risk behind the payroll tax cut. if you keep cutting payroll taxes, where are you going to get your social security from? \"if congress continues to cut the program's funding source, one of two things must happen: 1) social security's insolvency will be accelerated; or 2) social security will have to increasingly rely on general revenues (i.e., income taxes) to pay beneficiaries,\" explains the mercatus center's charles blahous. that tension, however, between short term electoral gratification and long term commonsense is palpable as media heads, pundits and election [game] day strategists play gotcha with candidates. it was played out in a recent interview in which cnn's wolf blitzer backed gop presidential candidate and former senator rick santorum (r-pa) into the corner. \"but am i hearing you correctly, senator?\" asked wolf on prowl for a rating and an emmy. \"you're saying you do want to increase taxes january 1st for 160 million americans?\" santorum, nervous, waffled around at first. \"i want to keep the tax - the taxes leveled on social security right now - the taxes leveled do not pay the benefits,\" he replied. \"there is more money being paid out in social security benefits than there is coming in to social security trust fund dollars .\" but, a second later, the fog cleared up and santorum was sounding as if he'd been coached by liberal nemesis bernie sanders. \"i am for tax cuts. i'd be very happy to come back and talk to the president about how we're going to provide tax relief for millions of americans. but i'm not - i've never been for a social security tax cut, because it undermines our ability to pay social security benefits .\" charles d. ellison,

the the lakers trailed chicago by seven points at the half of their game and l.a. just looked like a team that, despite its hustle, was a bit shorthanded and a lot out of sync. oh yeah, right, that's because they were. l.a. was playing without center andrew bynum and last year's sixth man of the year, lamar odom; the former serving a four-game suspension and the latter having become a dallas maverick after complaining to management for not informing him that he was to be part of the <mark>chris paul</mark> - to-l.a. deal that later was nixed by the league. the new-look lakers gave an inspiring performance in their 88-87 loss to the bulls sunday afternoon at staples center. the fact that they couldn't hold onto an 11-point lead late in the fourth quarter and missed big free throws that would have clinched the game were the biggest disappointments in an otherwise solid season opener for the purple and gold. lakers fans expect victories and championships, so to say it was a satisfying performance for new coach <mark>mike brown</mark> and company would not be fair. a loss stings any way you cut it. still, there were a number of positives to come from this loss, and the lakers will take those into sacramento as they take on the kings tonight in their second of three consecutive games to start the season. what can we surmise from just one game of the regular season? does this team have what it takes to win, compete and contend for the championship? <mark>magic</mark> says \"no way .\" what do you think? kobe's wrist injury affects his ability to handle the ball kobe's wrist injury is affecting his play. although bryant had 28 points (11-of-23 from the floor), seven rebounds, six assists and two steals, he also had eight turnovers-and that statistic alone is glaring. it was obvious that his injury (torn ligaments in his right wrist) affected his ability at times to handle the ball, especially in heavy traffic. true, it's the beginning of the season and teams will have more than their fair share of turnovers. but kobe's were due mainly to his inability to hold on to the basketball at key moments in the game. he actually appeared to further injure the hand late when he landed hard on the floor after making a spectacular turnaround baseline jumper over two bulls to keep l.a. in the lead. the team is taking kobe's condition day by day, and is hopeful he'll be able to go against the kings tonight and utah back at staples center on tuesday. the injury did not appear to hinder kobe's ability to make shots, but it did affect his control of the ball. the lakers can only hope their perennial all-star can play through the pain. he said he was fine, though it was obvious from his expressions that it the injury was bothering him. as kobe's health goes, so go the lakers. 2. devin ebanks gives the lakers much-needed young energy on the court small forwards devan ebanks and veteran metta world peace played about the same number of minutes against the bulls. what's obvious is that ebanks is athletic, poised and deserving of more playing time than mwp. ebanks made a number of nice plays sunday in scoring eight points on 4-of-5 shooting from the floor. he was the only lakers starter without a turnover and he brought the ball up the floor a couple of times, showing his ability to take on numerous roles. on one particular play in the second half, bryant led the team on a three-man fast break and found a streaking ebanks on the right flank for a beautiful bounce pass and finish at the basket. it reminded one of a young trevor ariza and emphasized the lakers' ongoing need for young, energetic legs to get up and down the court and spread their offense around. ebanks played a total of 23 minutes. he easily could play more and appears to have a bright future with the team. indiana and is admired by the coach for his tenacity and defense. but it was obvious sunday that <mark>brown</mark> plays no favorites. he elected to start ebanks and was happy with the outcome. 3. this team still has trouble with the three-point shot lakers starters took a total five shots from beyond the three-point arc, including two by pau gasol, which tells you something about their outside shooting. as good a shooter as gasol is from 15 to 18 feet, he should not be throwing up three-pointers. for the game, the team took 16 shots from the perimeter and made just four, which is an anemic 25 percent. <mark>mike brown</mark> feels if point guard steve blake gets enough minutes, he'll gain some confidence and knock down shots. blake played 23 minutes sunday and was on the court for the end of the game. it didn't help-he missed four of the six shots he took from downtown. the lone bright spot was rookie guard andrew goudelock, who made 2-of-3 from beyond the stripe. he has six points in 13 minutes and gave the team a catch-and-shoot option that hasn't really been in play since jordan farmar's days in l.a. several years ago. 4. the old pau gasol has not yet returned pau gasol played with a lot of heart sunday though it is obvious that his preferred position is power forward, not center. the bulls physical big men continually pushed him outside for most of his attempts and points. gasol finished with just 14 points sunday in 38 minutes of action. he took 14 shots and made six. two of those misses were from three-point range. gasol also missed four of the six free throws he attempted and two of those came in the waning minutes of the game. in essence, they cost the lakers the game. gasol needs to average 18-20 points per game for the team to be effective. he seemed to be playing out of place at times on sunday and that cost him a number of times. pau gasol can be a huge part of the lakers' success going forward. he may be playing with a chip on his shoulder at the moment, since the team was about to trade him in the <mark>chris paul</mark> deal. it's an awkward situation, yet he is handling it like the consummate professional he is. 5. <mark>mike brown</mark> was comfortable and capable in his coaching debut coach <mark>mike brown</mark> seemed unfazed by the glitz of hollywood in his debut for the lakers. he substituted players at the right time, called timeouts when the team needed them and generally gets a high mark. kobe bryant the ball with the lakers up by a point in the final minute. this time it was the player, bryant, who made the mistake. he should have held onto the ball when he was double - teamed and forced the bulls to foul him, rather than attempting to pass to pau gasol, have it intercepted and see chicago come down the court and win the game on a derek rose eight-foot floater in the lane. \"anytime we have a lead in that situation, we know a team's got to foul,\" said <mark>brown</mark> to dave mcmenamin of espnlosangeles.com. \"the shot clock was off and the ball went to the right player's hands. i'm not sure, i have not asked him why he jumped to make the pass. we would have liked for him to hold on to it and for them to foul him and him go knock down the two free throws .\" <mark>brown</mark> is missing a key player (center andrew bynum), has had a very brief time to look at several newcomers (forwards <mark>troy murphy</mark>, jason kapono and josh mcroberts) and is giving considerable minutes to a rookie (guard andrew goudelock) and small forward (devin ebanks). and yet he seemed in control of the situation on sunday and had the team ready to play. most importantly, the team's coach on the court-kobe bryant-came away impressed with a lot that went right on sunday. kobe told mcmenamin: \"they're (chicago) one of the best teams in the league and we did a phenomenal job holding them down defensively. we beat ourselves at the end with turnovers and free throws .\" what is the duplicate article? why is this article offensive? where is this article plagiarized from? amare stoudemire buys baller new mansion we'd like to send you the
