in this case, the human journey of police and policing. depression and anxiety disorders - including post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) - are being recorded among police at rates higher than the national average. among rcmp members, mental disabilities now represent nearly half of all disabilities and i project that this trend is taking hold among police organizations across canada. a number of factors are in play. one is chronic job stress driven not so much by the risks of the work that police do but by the kind of workplace they inhabit. a second - compounding the first - is the embedded frustration related to the increased complexity of basic police work. growing demands range from the court, exponential growth of paper work, and autocratic managerial styles of senior officers who are also under the bureaucratic gun. a third is the accumulative effects of years of exposure among police veterans in their pre-retirement years to the horrors of everyday life they confront - everyday. a fourth, the hardening links between things like hypertension, no sleep, chronic pain and depression and anxiety. depression increases the risk of heart attack among police officers, weakens their immune system, and destroys the capacity to concentrate and relax. a vicious circle. these are not conditions of weak character, or human weakness of any kind. these are physical conditions with psychological effects. chronic job stress is caused by chronically excessive over-production of hormones, affecting brain function, blood flow and the health of the human heart. for too long, these conditions have been perceived as \"invisible\" or \"personal\" or even faked. all of this is plain wrong. in fact, using powerful brain scans, doctors can watch just how the brain changes among soldiers suffering ptsd and concussion-type injuries. we can see ptsd as it happens. we can see depression as it happens. and there is hope for the future. the neural signs of ptsd are not permanent and can change with treatment. a cure is possible. and through research now being done by harvard and mcgill in a joint project for the us army, a cure may be on the way. that said, clinical treatments for depression and anxiety are just part of what needs to happen. fundamentally, we need psychologically-healthy workplaces for police. i see clear evidence of embedded frustration among the rank and file. tremendously tense perception of senior management. gruelling doubts that the public supports police. these sensations flow into, through, and around the workplace of police and signal a public health problem right in the heart of our police community. managing the police workplace isn't easy. but its clear, a quiet revolution of management practices is called for, and one has begun at the rcmp. a transformation process in our national police force is underway. one of the stepchildren of that is a slate of \"principles of wellbeing\" to guide the future management of the rcmp. the focus is on member and employee health, wellbeing and employee renewal. 1. management practices of the future that promote employee and family wellbeing as an everyday cultural norm. 2. fairness and transparency defining how workload is assigned. 3. a priority on human relations in the rcmp workplace. a revolutionary concept in police work. members will be trained for this. the principles of wellbeing also set out a commitment to managing the distress of rcmp members more effectively. rcmp commissioner <mark>bill elliott</mark> launched an initiative earlier this year boldly aimed at \"the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and compassion fatigue .\" compassion fatigue. the heart of a police officer breaking again and again as he or she picks up the pieces of lives on the street, in the back lots and among families of every walk of life. toronto police chief <mark>bill blair</mark>, in a conversation with me, made it very clear he is committed to promoting the mental health of police. i serve on an informal, grassroots committee among toronto police members and advocates who are proposing a mental learning initiative. i am confident chief <mark>bill blair</mark>, who also serves as president of canadian chiefs of police association, will spread that message nationally. police chiefs are well-placed to lead a national mental health campaign. suicide prevention of suicide is a significant dimension of that. police experience its aftermath in the community and its tragedy among their own numbers. we rely upon cops for a lot and it would be more than timely for civic leaders, politicians judges and lawyers to help police navigate the mental health storm now gathering in law enforcement. police work is more complex today than ever. the courts demand more than ever. public expectations are climbing higher than ever. depression and anxiety among are growing faster than ever among police. this calls for a new approach to police health and safety - one that serves and protects the mental health of the men and women who serve and protect us."}, {"articleID": "2019111816_00141720_W", "names": {"Mike Murray": ["Q16091548", "Q6380412"]}, "date": "2019-11-18", "url": "https://www.timesleader.com/news/762936/nanticoke-native-palovchak-named-times-leader-circulation-director", "content": "Lori Vandermark. Aimee Dilger | Times Leader - WILKES-BARRE--A newspaper industry industry veteran with a diverse background including advertising and marketing experience has returned to the Times Leader Media Group as the organization's new circulation director. Nanticoke native Lorri Palovchak comes to the paper most recently from the Luzerne County Transportation Authority, where she was manager of public relations. \"We are extremely lucky to be able to add a person of Lorri's caliber to our team,\" Times Leader Media Group Publisher <mark>Mike Murray</mark> said. \"In addition to her general newspaper circulation knowledge, her service and communication expertise will aid us in providing an even better customer experience for our readership,\" <mark>Murray</mark> added. \"We look forward to her joining us .\" Palovchak, who previously worked at the Times Leader as single copy marketing manager in 2003-04, is enthusiastic about her return to the publication. \"I think the Times Leader is an incredible product. We need to make sure we can deliver that incredible product to the customers,\" she said. \"We need to have top-notch customer service and get them the paper when they need it, because we know people depend on it .\" Palovchak is a 1982 Greater Nanticoke Area graduate who spent two decades moving around the country and overseas with her late husband, Frank Vandermark, who served in the U.S. Air Force. She began her newspaper career while the couple were living in Biloxi, Miss. \"I was a military wife and we were looking to make some money, so my husband and I became adult carriers,\" Palovchak recalled. It was at the time when the Knight-Ridder chain, which owned the Biloxi paper (and formerly owned the Times Leader) was switching from youths to adults as newspaper carriers, she explained. \"My husband was in computers, so we literally started computer billing before anyone else did and we turned our route into a business,\" Palovchak said. \"We got so good at it they started giving us routes that went down. We would fix it up and build it up and give it back to them .\" That led to a promotion. \"I was the first carrier ever hired as a district manager,\" Palovchak said. \"I worked in home delivery and I really enjoyed it. I had a lot of success, and I liked building routes and building carriers .\" Palovchak also participated in what that paper's editor called \"total newspaper training,\" a program that allowed leaders in each department to learn how every other department operated. It would lead a path to a new career in the next town. \"I really enjoyed my time in advertising. So when we left Biloxi and went to Colorado Springs, I tried my hand at advertising,\" she said. For the next five-a-half years she sold advertising to the military market for a military newspaper there. Next was Belleville, Ill., and another Knight-Ridder paper where Palovchak worked as a single copy manager. From there the family moved to Germany, \"where there weren't a lot of newspaper openings,\" she said, but Palovchak did operate a gas station on a NATO base. Stateside once again, it was back to the couple's native Northeastern Pennsylvania, and a year at the Times Leader. Palovchak worked for a family business for a time, and then at West Side Career & Technology Center as their career resource recruiter. She later became a certified trainer for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, working in emergency management for such events as flood recovery and the 2015 Papal visit. In that year she joined LCTA, initially as a marketing coordinator. But it also was a year marked by deep personal loss. \"My late husband was one of the 22 veterans a day who take their lives,\" Palovchak said. She is active in the veterans community, and works on suicide awareness with veterans groups. \"It's very dear to my heart,\" Palovchak said. Last year she married David Palovchak, and the couple live in Swoyersville. \"We are fully committed to NEPA,\" said the mother of two and grandmother of three. \"This is home .\" For that reason, Palovchak is focused on how to meet the needs of existing and future customers of the hometown newspaper. \"I'm pretty technical. I get news on social media, I get news on the Internet, but I also need to have a newspaper in my hands,\" Palovchak said. \"My vision is to make sure that we continue to get the product in front of current subscribers but also new subscribers, make sure Millennials know what it's like to have a newspaper in their hands and also promote the community service that we provide,\" she added. \"We need to make sure that our customers know that we care .\" Lori Vandermark.

The decision by the organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade to bar a group representing gay veterans from participating is leading to more political fallout.

This year's Chief Marshal also stepped down in light of the vote to bar OutVets.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh previously said he would not participate if OutVets was excluded. 7:45 a.m.. The organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade made history in 2015 when after decades of resistance they allowed a group of gay veterans to participate. Now, that group, OutVets, say they have been denied a spot in this year's parade scheduled for March 19. OutVets said on their Facebook page that \"While the reason for our denial is unclear, one can only assume it's because we are LGBTQ .\" Ed Flynn, a member of the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, the parade's organizer, says he voted to allow OutVets to participate.

Attorney General Xavier Becerra said while it is the federal government's responsibility to protect the nation's borders, the goal should be public safety, not deporting otherwise law-abiding immigrants who are in the country illegally .\" We will, as always, work with our federal partners in every respect to go after drug dealers, human traffickers, potential terrorists, \"Becerra said .\" We're not in the business of deportation. We're in the business of public safety. \"Becerra and other Democrats spoke in response to an anonymous report in the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday that said federal officials are preparing for a major immigration sweep in San Francisco and other Northern California cities. House Passes Budget Bill Aimed at Averting Shutdown Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said agency policy is to neither confirm nor deny the possibility or existence of a specific operation. ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan has repeatedly lambasted California and Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark>, a Democrat, over a new state law that strictly limits the cooperation of local law enforcement with federal immigration authorities when they are booked into jail for other reasons. A day after the law took effect in California, he said ICE will\" vastly increase our enforcement footprint in the state of California. \"\"California better hold on tight,\" he told Fox News on Jan. 2. \"They're about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers in the state of California. If the politicians in California don't want to protect their communities, then ICE will .\" Activists Urge Travelers to \"Know Your Rights' Democratic U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris sent Homan a letter Wednesday asking to be briefed on how raids are prioritized and for all communications regarding upcoming raids in California .\" Diverting resources in an effort to punish California and score political points is an abhorrent abuse of power, not to mention a terrible misuse of scarce resources, \"they wrote.

Becerra and former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, now the University of California president, spoke at a news conference urging young immigrants to apply to remain in the country after a federal judge prevented Trump from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Napolitano said when she was secretary under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, immigration officials concentrated on deporting felons, particularly violent felons, gang members, security threats and those caught soon after crossing the border .\" The current administration has kind of erased all of those priorities and said anybody in the country without documentation is fair game, \"she said .\" I think one can question whether that is the best use of our law enforcement resources. \"Deportation arrests have surged about 40 percent under Trump's presidency, even without a budget increase. Homan, in a recent interview with The Associated Press, said authorities still target people with criminal histories but limits on access to local jails will prompt them to chase them elsewhere, potentially arresting others who happen to be there and are in the country illegally. Trump and other administration officials have singled out San Francisco for criticism, repeatedly raising the 2015 fatal shooting of Kate Steinle by Mexican man who had been deported five times and was recently acquitted of murder.

TV How MKR became \"dead in the water' by <mark>James Weir</mark> 9th Feb 2020 7:36 AM 0 You know a TV show is dead in the water when people would literally rather watch footage of public transport. That's what happened to My Kitchen Rules this week when it returned to humiliating ratings. Its Monday night premiere pulled in just 517,000 people in capital cities and by Tuesday it sank to 402,000. Meanwhile, Married At First Sight premiered to 1,154,000. The final punch in the guts for MKR? Great Australian Railway Journeys over on SBS pulled in more viewers than the former juggernaut. What is Great Australian Railway Journeys? From what I gather, it's basically just some British guy who catches a train around Australia. It's a step above the\" slow TV \"movement where people tune in to watch a train slowly roll through the countryside for eight hours. Yep, it's actually a thing. Maybe that's how Gladys Berejiklian can get some money back on those old-timey trams no one asked for. None of us want to ride on them because it's not the 1940s. But she could strap a GoPro to the front and sell the footage to Seven to replace MKR with. It's a win for Sydney and a win for Seven and a win for us because apparently that's what we want to watch. We'd rather be locked on Gladys' slow trams than watch MKR. Anyway, the word from viewers is they miss the original MKR recipe. Seven has messed with the formula that made it a ratings smash in an attempt to rival the drama on Married At First Sight. Last year there was a storyline about two contestants hooking up. And while filming for this year's season was going on, reports surfaced that a crew member was accused of filming two contestants while they had sex on a couch. We've seen lots of insane stuff on MAFS over the years - cheating, a mild-choking, an attempted glassing. But we've never seen full-blown sex acts. You know something's inappropriate when even MAFS producers draw a line. People don't want hook ups with their cook ups! The only cheating scandals we want on MKR involve someone putting laxatives in another team's baked quail. All these TV shows are becoming the same and it's hard to tell them apart. MKR is morphing into MAFS with its sexiness and drunken dinner parties. Pretty soon Survivor will also probably introduce some kind of drunken tribal circle where someone gets a coconut thrown at their head .\" Any minute there's going to be sex on Survivor - some of those people are very, very attractive, \"columnist and author Kerri Sackville said on the Not Here To Make Friends podcast. And she's right - this week there was a wrestling challenge on Survivor that viewers compared to porn. If you missed it, I can send you my screenshots. Honestly, I'll probably start watching survivor now. Anyway, Kerri was a guest on the podcast with Sam Dastyari and we were talking about all these reality shows becoming the same and how they should just be rolled into one so we can save time .\" I do think we can bring them all together, \"she said .\" What we need to do is get all the MAFS couples onto the Survivor island. And then the MKR people come in and they cook them a meal. And they're all starving so, whatever the food is, they just think it's fantastic - so no one's crying which means they have to create drama in other ways. \"Even Dancing With The Stars, which returns tonight, is cashing in by casting one of MAFS' old cheaters. I just hope Great Australian Railway Journeys doesn't buckle to the trend and introduce a sex scandal. No one wants to see that. More screenshots of the Survivor porn from my archives. IT'S HARD TO RESPECT A BUSINESSMAN ON A RAZOR SCOOTER In big cities around Australia, professionals and business executives are whizzing around on Razor scooters and we're all pretending like that's normal. It's not. I can't respect a businessman on a scooter - it's like a visual oxymoron. Someone who's loving the scooter trend is Deborra-Lee Furness. She has been whizzing around Manhattan on a scooter for the past few months and I'm just obsessed with it. I've even set up a Google alert for\" Deb Lee Furness scooter \"so I don't miss an update. Whenever I'm feeling down, I just scroll through photos of Mrs Hugh Jackman hooning around the streets of SoHo and all is right in the world again. Me leaving work early before my boss notices. DIGGING THROUGH THE MAFS REJECT BIN About 15,000 Aussies applied to be on Married At First Sight this year and only 20 were successfully recruited into the mess. This begs the question: Where the hell are these 14,980 rejected applicants and who the hell are they? I've launched a Freedom Of Information request to get to the bottom of this and we're slowly getting answers. If you or someone you know was rejected, please get in touch. On this week's episode of the Not Here To Make Friends podcast, an asexual woman called in and told her story about being ghosted by the MAFS producers. Ouch, huh? You'd think producers would love to throw an asexual person in the mix. Then again, producers probably realised halfway through the interview process that - given this is basically a show about horny people cheating on each other - they probably wouldn't provide the level of drama required. On tonight's episode of the podcast, we'll hear from a man who is attracted to guys and girls but wanted MAFS producers to pair him with a wife. Why did producers say no? We'll find out.
