Guardian Ad Litem is a government-assisted, volunteer-based organization that speaks for children moved from their homes due to courtroom intervention. These children, who have been abused, neglected or abandoned, are often removed from a toxic environment and placed into care of others. Carita <mark>Smith</mark>, the Crestview Guardian Ad Litem program's volunteer coordinator, hosted the event. The goal was to encourage more people to volunteer for the program. \"We have lots of volunteers and I appreciate them,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said during the ceremony. \"But right now, we have over 200 (children) without Guardian Ad Litem. So that means those children get up and have nobody to speak on their behalf and have nobody to visit them and nobody to make sure they are not hurt, harmed or endangered again .\" A basket with 201 flowers was placed inside a lookout pavilion overlooking a pond at the park. Following the service, attendees tossed flowers into the pond in remembrance of children without representation. Additionally, area judges and program directors spoke and there were performances from the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church children's choir, Jeilani Champion and Dr. <mark>Linda Smith</mark>. \"Doing from my heart' Crestview resident Malcolm Parker said Sunday's event taught him a lot about the issue .\" It opened my eyes a little bit, \"he said .\" You don't always pay attention to what's going on with the children in the community. \"Parker said he's considering volunteering and wants to help spread the word. Tammy Hillsman, who has worked with Guardian for the past eight months, said she enjoys speaking on the children's behalf .\" I just want to be there because whatever situation we step in to, it's a tragedy from the very beginning, \"she said .\" I'm basically there to help them get through it. \"Hillsman said she is working on two cases involving four children. On average, she handles two cases at a time, she said. The workload is never a burden, she said .\" They try not to overwhelm you; they start you off slow \"Hillsman said. And it's fulfilling, she said .\" I'm doing from my heart - I don't want to get paid for it, \"Hillsman said .\" I'm just doing it for those children. \"Want to volunteer?

Perhaps some thirteen billion years. Harvard Astrophysicist, Avi Loeb speaks on the surprising habitability of planets in the early Universe far earlier than the creation of the Milky Way. Surprisingly, temperatures in the early cosmos were similar to those on Earth today. The cosmological conditions for life were in place far earlier than commonly thought. The NASA image at the top of the page shows one of the first stars, which formed around 13.7 billion years ago. The discovery was made by lead researcher <mark>Stefan Keller</mark> of The Australian National University and the results were published in Nature. Dr. <mark>Keller</mark>'s team operates the SkyMapper telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales. Because elements heavier than helium are forged in the cores of stars, the first ones were made mostly out of hydrogen. The telescope is able to detect these first stars because the low iron content influences their color. Using this technique to find early stars, the SkyMapper is currently in a 5-year-long survey, mapping the ancient Southern sky. This star formed so early in our Universe's history, was most likely a second-generation star. Because of the chemical composition, astronomers can gather information about the earlier primordial star, which is believed to be 60 times more massive than our sun and composed of hydrogen and helium.

It shows that worrying about the future of cricket, and English cricket in particular, is nothing new. However, whereas Sutcliffe was concerned by ice skating and greyhound racing taking people away from cricket, the worry now is about how one type of cricket--Twenty20 (T20) franchise leagues--could spell the end of another in five-day Tests. The recent decisions of England internationals Adil Rashid and Alex Hales to sign \"white-ball\" only county contracts--a red ball is used in traditional first-class matches--this season, thereby opting out of Test contention, heightened these concerns. Rashid and Hales have not played a Test since 2016, but the worry for some is that, without a major alteration to cricket's congested schedule and a change in spectator habits--Tests outside of England and Australia often draw paltry crowds--their example might be followed by that of more high-profile cricketers. Jonny Bairstow, a Yorkshire and England teammate of Rashid, is alive to the danger, although the wicketkeeper remains committed to continuing his Test career. \"If we're not careful, there are going to be more and more people [giving up red-ball cricket],\" said Bairstow, who is on tour with England in New Zealand. \"You've got lucrative tournaments...[to] go off for five weeks and earn a heck of a lot of money...[with] the strain and stress on the body of bowling [only] four overs compared to 24 in a day in Test cricket,\" he said. Bairstow's thoughts were echoed by Test colleague <mark>James Anderson</mark>, with England's all-time leading Test bowler adding: \"I just hope and pray there is enough love for Test cricket out there, not just the players that are playing at the moment, but players coming through still having the ambition and drive to play Test cricket in the future .\" Bairstow and <mark>Anderson</mark> grew up in an environment where the most reliable way for cricketers to maximize their income was to become an established Test player, as this would lead to a larger wage packet and enhanced opportunities for sponsorship deals. To gain Test selection, players would have to take part in domestic first-class competitions such as England's County Championship or Australia's Sheffield Shield. However, the advent of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other T20 franchise events has created an environment where it is now possible to make major money, in cricket terms, without playing Tests. For example, England all-rounder Ben Stokes was bought for \uffe1 1.37 million (US $1.89 million) by the Rajasthan Royals during January's IPL auction. By offering specialist \"white-ball,\" as well as Test, central contracts in a bid to improve England's woeful record at major global limited-overs tournaments, the England and Wales Cricket Board might have inadvertently made it easier for players to turn their backs on the first-class game. \"You always want your best players playing as much high-quality cricket as you can,\" England selector <mark>Angus Fraser</mark> said on Friday."}, {"articleID": "2010101205_00241860_W", "names": {"Phil Williams": ["Q20774381", "Q26899389", "Q50328322", "Q55940265", "Q7182552", "Q7182553", "Q7182554", "Q7182556"]}, "date": "2010-10-12", "url": "http://bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v6dpm/microsite", "content": "bbc - bbc radio 5 live programmes - 5 live breakfast @ import url (/ 5live/style/global-layout. css); @ import url (/ 5live/style/global-decor. css); british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links text only skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help now on air - 5 live breakfast webcam listen live less 06:00 - 09:00 call 0500 909 693 text 85058 cost info email breakfast @ bbc.co.uk next on air 09:00 5 live breakfast view full schedule home programmes schedule news sport life podcasts breakfast weekdays 06:00 - 10:00 home get in touch about nicky campbell about shelagh fogarty facebook page bbc radio 5 live programmes 5 live breakfast 5 live breakfast 5 live's breakfast programme with news, sport, weather and money reports. programmes: on bbc iplayer (48) clips (2) coming up (13) previous programmes: by series (2) by year (1493) available now on bbc iplayer listen to the latest programme your call 11/10/2010 more: programme information listen now (60 minutes) available since yesterday with 6 days left. how much should students have to pay to go to university?

I think [raising the stakes after Spider-Man 2] was the thinking going into it, and I think that's what doomed us.

The director said he would, although he would have to care about the characters. \"I wouldn't make that movie. If I had a different story with characters that I cared about and was engaging, yes, in a second. I love Spider-Man. That was never the issue, just that I made the wrong story, the wrong way.

In the ever-changing online world, it's possible for kids to come across something or someone that could do them harm. Police say it happens far too often and want parents to be more aware. Facebook, SnapChat, Instagram and Twitter are used multiple times every day. Kids are social and are using these apps and sites to share with each other. \"I think there's so many things out there now,\" said local parent, Craig Vaughn. \"When I was growing up all we had were encyclopedias. That was about all the technology we had .\" Vaughn has two kids, one of them a teenage girl who he tries to protect from potential online predators. \"Our computer is in the living room. If you wannause the main computer or lab top, it's in the living room,\" said Vaughn. \"So, everybody knows what you're doing .\" But the hardest thing to monitor are the smart phones. \"The kids have the computer in their pocket. You can't put it in a room where you can supervise them,\" said Sergeant Brent Barbee with the Amarillo Police Department. \"So, protecting them from predators and bad influences online has become more difficult .\" Barbee says the first step in protection starts with the parent. \"Sitting down with the children and having some really clear, frank discussion about ground rules,\" said Barbee. \"Rules like don't go to websites that other people tell you about, don't have contacts or conversations with people that you don't know in real life .\" Teach children to be smart while online--share with caution, that goes for pictures and details about their life. \"So often, very small things can turn into a lot of threat for a kid,\" said Barbee. Barbee also says parents should teach kids to be nice to others online and if your kids have a cell phone, know their apps. Check their privacy settings and make sure their information doesn't get in the wrong hands. All good advice for parents just like Vaughn. \"You might be saving your kid from big problems in the future,\" said Vaughn. Parents should also check the ratings and reviews of video games kids are playing. If they chat with other players online, make sure the child knows not to give out personal information.

by lisa leff associated press san francisco (ap) - federal officials no longer plan to contest joint bankruptcy pleadings brought by legally married same-sex couples, a department of justice spokeswoman said friday. the obama administration's recent position is that the federal law forbidding government recognition of same-sex unions is unconstitutional. justice department spokeswoman tracy schmaler said government lawyers decided this week that letting gay and lesbian couples jointly petition for bankruptcy protection is consistent with that stance .\" the department of justice has informed bankruptcy courts that it will no longer seek dismissal of bankruptcy petitions filed jointly by same-sex debtors who are married under state law, \"schmaler said. the shift stems from a case involving two california men who got married when it was briefly legal in 2008 before the state's voters passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. a u.s. bankruptcy trustee initially fought gene balas and <mark>carlos morales</mark>' shared chapter 13 bankruptcy plan on the grounds that the federal defense of marriage act prohibited it. but 20 of the 24 bankruptcy judges in los angeles took the unusual step of disagreeing and ruled last month that the act violated the couple's civil rights. trustee <mark>peter anderson</mark> subsequently appealed, maintaining president barack obama had ordered government lawyers to defend the ban\" unless and until \"congress repeals the act or there is a final judicial ruling striking it down. but <mark>anderson</mark> withdrew his objections in a written filing wednesday. he noted that even a u.s. house of representatives group that has stepped in to defend the marriage act's constitutionality in other cases had decided against taking part in <mark>morales</mark> and balas' case .\" in light of the decision by the (bipartisan legal advisory group) not to participate in this appeal and the availability of other judicial fora for resolution of the constitutional question, the united states trustee has determined that it is not a necessary or appropriate expenditure of the resources of this court and the parties to continue to litigate the appeal, \"<mark>anderson</mark>'s office wrote. even before the justice department arrived at its position this week, another bankruptcy trustee in san diego already had cited the administration's decision to stop defending the defense of marriage act in a request to withdraw her opposition to the bankruptcy pleading of another married gay couple. the department's change in policy already has provided the basis for the government to drop its opposition to an attempt by a same-sex couple to seek joint bankruptcy protection in new york state .\" by having the department change its policy nationwide in response to gene and <mark>carlos</mark>' case, we basically accomplished what it would normally take a supreme court ruling to achieve, \"robert pfister, a lawyer for the los angeles couple. balas, 42, a freelance economics writer, and <mark>morales</mark>, 46, a graphic designer, said friday that having the government recognize their marriage for purposes of declaring bankruptcy has practical and profound implications. they will not have to pay extra court fees to file separate petitions, nor go through the exhausting task of trying to untangle their financial lives, which include joint bank accounts, joint debts and jointly owned real estate. he said, however, that as long as the defense of marriage act and state-level same-sex marriage bans remain in effect, he and his husband are not truly equal. when he was considering taking a job in another state, for instance, he had to consider if their marriage would be recognized for purposes of taxes, hospital visitation, inheritance and other spousal rights .\" if you asked an opposite-sex married couple to move to a state where their relationship would be instantly divorced if they moved from say, california, across the border to arizona, you would see how doma and the patchwork of state laws created a problem for married same-sex couples such as <mark>carlos</mark> and myself, \"he said. obama's stance on doma also was cited this week by a federal appeals court in san francisco that ordered the pentagon to immediately stop enforcing the 17-year-old law that prohibits gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from serving openly in the armed forces. ktre.com rss news feeds rss (really simple syndication) is an easy way for you to keep up with all of your favorite news and information. get news, weather, sports, movie and tv listings, stocks, flight tracker, and more, anytime, anywhere on your cell phone or pda with ktre 9 to go! click here for details."}]
