sehwag thrashed the australian attack for a quick half century to equal the world record for the highest number of consecutive half-centuries in test cricket, on the second day of the first test at the mohali cricket stadium here on saturday. however, the australian journalists here have criticised him. according to them, <mark>mitchell johnson</mark>, who had announced he would trap sehwag with his short-pitched deliveries, has succeeded and that the fiery batsman has a weakness against rising deliveries. one of the headlines in a leading australian newspaper said \"<mark>johnson</mark>'s jibe hits home as short ball removes red-hot sehwag .\" sehwag does not seem to be amused by all this. in fact, many bowlers in the past had claimed they would trap him with short-pitched balls outside the off stump and get him caught. and sehwag did fall a few times to such deliveries. but a short-pitched delivery outside the off stump has often been hit for a six by the dashing delhi opener. on several occasions, his slashed cut had sailed over the point boundary and landed into the stands! just before this series against australia, when someone had asked him to comment on the criticism about his batting style, sehwag cited a popular hindi saying which translates into something like this: \"when an elephant walks, many dogs bark, but the elephant keeps walking without showing any importance to the lesser creatures. and that is exactly how i like to deal with my critics .\" email a friend emailing an article to friend is a simple way to share a news item. your

felony charges stemming from an investigation into whether she steered hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracts to her own public relations firm and associates who might not have done any work. deputy chief of staff carla oglesby's arrest is the latest blow to stroger, who enters his final two months in office buffeted by political defeat and the growing scandal that followed. oglesby pushed through a series of so-called 24-9 contracts that fell just under the $25,000 threshold for county board approval, angering many commissioners. on monday, some commissioners suggested oglesby's arrest should be the tipping point for putting the stroger administration into a caretaker role until a new county board president is elected nov. 2 and takes office in early december. stroger did not respond to a message left on his cell phone, but his spokesmen said stroger would have no comment before learning more about the charges leveled against oglesby, the spokeswoman for his failed democratic primary re-election campaign. stroger put her on the county payroll after his loss .> oglesby was arrested on a warrant as she pulled her vehicle out of a downtown parking garage shortly before 4 p.m. monday, said sally daly, a spokeswoman for state's attorney <mark>anita alvarez</mark>. oglesby is expected in court tuesday morning for a bond hearing. \"(oglesby) left work early, and she was seen entering her car,\" daly said. \"our investigators moved in, and as she was exiting the garage, they blocked her car and she was arrested without incident .\" oglesby is charged with felony theft of government services, money laundering and official misconduct, daly said. the government services count carries a sentence of 6 to 30 years upon conviction. \"i can tell you that at the state's attorney's direction, our investigators arrested her this afternoon as the result of a long-term investigation generally about the 24-9 contracts and her involvement with them,\" said dan kirk, chief of staff to <mark>alvarez</mark>. \"(oglesby) is being processed at the chicago police facility at homan square and will appear in bond court tomorrow .\" an attempt to contact oglesby's attorney for comment was not successful. at least a dozen of the contracts, worth a total of nearly $250,000, are being looked at by county inspector general patrick blanchard, who has been working with <mark>alvarez</mark>'s office for months. part of the investigation focused on whether any work was actually done in exchange for the contract payments, which were made at the time of approval, rather than upon the completion of work, as is usual. one of the payments went to cgc communications, a firm owned by oglesby, and another went to a firm that didn't even register with the state until the tribune started asking questions about how it got the deal. stroger briefly suspended oglesby earlier this year from her $120,000-a-year county job after reports that she authorized a $24,975 contract to cgc, which was supposed to inform suburban residents about federal flood relief grants. oglesby, the one-time promoter of sports stars and hip-hop artists, sought approval for all of the contracts, records show. she also played a role in authorizing nearly $150,000 in payments for census outreach contracts, which were given to people recommended by oglesby and eugene mullins, stroger's spokesman and childhood friend. those payments were to be repaid with federal grant money, but the county ended up eating the costs after it was determined they were not eligible for the grant program. one of those contracts was the one with cgc. another went to arrei management inc. under a proposal by cgc's director of strategy and marketing. arrei's task was to \"build awareness of the (county's) composting and electronic collection programs .\" <mark>mark carter</mark>, arrei's owner, is a west side activist who helped circulate pro-stroger fliers during the campaign that referred to the eventual winner, chicago ald. toni preckwinkle, as \"aunt je\" mamie, \"documents reveal. two of the census contracts went to companies run by men who belong to the rap duo dude 'n nem, best known for the single\" we are going to mcdonald's. \"in another case, oglesby sought approval of a contract with alliance media and marketing to\" build awareness of (county) energy and conservation programs. \"alliance media was incorporated may 24, after the tribune asked why it was not listed as a corporation in state records. the county board meets tuesday, and oglesby's arrest will loom large. in may, commissioners voted to put new restrictions on stroger's authority over spending in the last months of his administration, including requiring him to report within three days all contracts not preapproved by the board .\" i think this should cause the stroger administration to basically end now and go into a caretaker role, \"said commissioner larry suffredin, d-evanston .\" the 24-9 contracts that were awarded behind the board's back were totally inappropriate, \"said commissioner timothy schneider, r-streamwood .\" i think a statement is being delivered with this arrest that waste and corruption cannot be tolerated in cook county. \"tribune reporter serena daniels contributed to this report", "articleID": "2010100504_00047242_W", "names": {"Anita Alvarez":

"billionaire creates job for illegal immigrant, can't get no respect since republicans are frequently criticized for racial insensitivity, it's important to spotlight their progress in this area. case in point - did you know that california gubernatorial candidate meg whitman created a job for a young illegal immigrant named nicky diaz santillan? whitman employed santillan as a housekeeper for nine years, and i think we can all agree no racist would let a mexican near their personal belongings like that. however, whitman's in a pickle because she didn't know santillan was illegal (so whitman claims, anyway). once she found out, she had no choice but to terminate santillan, because that's what law-abiding employers do. to say santillan didn't take it well would be a massive understatement - she hired professional douchebag lawyer gloria allred to sue whitman. nothing illustrates the phrase \"no good deed goes unpunished\" like this nasty santillan business. custom requires me to point out meg whitman is a billionaire. does anyone not know she's a billionaire? in case you were unaware, meg whitman is supposedly, according to some estimates, worth upwards of one billion dollars. forbes lists her net worth at $1.3 billion. she's also spent tens of millions of her own fortune on her campaign, if that means anything to you. personally, i'm always in favor of an individual's right to spend their hard-earned money on frivolous pursuits. billionaire. so as you can imagine, being rich means you need a little help with the chores. santillan was whitman's domestic for almost a decade, and everything was in order until one fateful day. santillan confessed to whitman she was an illegal immigrant, and had provided false documentation of citizenship when applying for work. depending on whom you believe, santillan came clean out of loyalty to whitman, to warn her that this immigration issue could hurt the campaign. when faced with an admission of fraud, whitman terminated santillan's employment. apparently santillan wasn't expecting that reaction, and has retaliated with the legal equivalent of shock and awe: an attorney for nicky diaz santillan, the former housekeeper of california republican gubernatorial candidate meg whitman, claimed today that whitman was aware of santillan's status as an illegal immigrant and fired the housekeeper when she asked for help. the attorney, gloria allred, said she was filing a claim for lost wages that are due to santillan. the two women appeared at a press conference where santillan tearfully discussed the allegations. if i had to choose between being sued by gloria allred or being waterboarded? i actually think my chances of surviving waterboarding without lasting damage would be pretty good. seriously. wouldn't you? whether or not whitman mistreated santillan on occasion is beside the point now. hiring gloria allred is a decision that forfeits any reasonable benefit of doubt. in the parlance of the 2006 israel-lebanon war, deploying gloria allred is a disproportionate response. it's a morally repugnant act, comparable to suicide-bombing. outside of <mark>john edwards</mark>, there is no personification of pernicious lawyer-ism as thoroughly detestable as gloria allred. she barely seems human. allred's shameless attention-whoring is matched only by her transparent phoniness. this whole santillan case is quite obviously meant to harm whitman's campaign. it's certainly not for santillan's benefit. allred produced a letter from the social security administration that she says proves whitman knew santillan was undocumented in 2003. you can read the letter here (pdf), but it doesn't quite convey allred's undeserved self-satisfaction like this picture: the letter indicates there was a problem with santillan's social security number, which supposedly proves whitman is lying about not knowing santillan's immigration status. look, you can see whitman's husband's handwriting right there! it says, \"nicky please look into this. thanks .\" what a bastard! despite the flowery build up, it's not exactly evidence of anything other than whitman's husband's good manners. the third paragraph of the letter says, \"this letter does not imply that you or your employee intentionally provided incorrect information about the employee's name or ssn .\" it also says the letter is not a basis for terminating an employee, and that employers may face legal consequences if they do. all an employer can do is let their employee know about the letter and ask them to look into it. thanks. in her haste to embarrass whitman, it's very likely allred is harming her client. by holding a press conference, she's announced to the world her client is an illegal alien and a fraud. that's a peculiar way of advocating the client's best interests. in view of santillan's admitted dishonesty, any chance of winning a lawsuit for mistreatment is slim. by gratuitously manipulating her emotionally vulnerable client, allred has reached new depths of ignominy in a profession that is already famous for its depravity. for a more entertaining version of that same argument, here's greta van sustern ripping allred apart while she sits there wallowing in false indignation. but the ultimate responsibility is with santillan. if she truly felt exploited or treated unfairly by whitman, she could have sought employment elsewhere. nine years is a long time to keep a job you don't like. reports indicate santillan earned the equivalent of $47,000 annually when she worked for whitman, which suggests she has a valuable skill set. even when you account for california's high cost of living, $47,000 is better than median income. santillan could have gotten another job for less pay and still made a comfortable living. it's not as if she didn't have options. and post under your registered name. if not, you can post as a guest or i would have sex with gloria allred...posted by: fat ass tna troll (guest) on october 06, 2010 at 09:25 pm that's it, you just changed my mind i'm voting for meg whitman now privacy policy. please help us serve you better, fill

to face a wave of anger when it publishes a report expected to pave the way for millions of public sector workers to pay more into their pension and retire later. ministers will be on a collision course with the country's most powerful trade unions, who have warned that slashing pensions will add to the \"volatile cocktail\" of job and pay cuts already facing health, education, council and other employees. an interim report by former labour minister lord hutton is expected to highlight an \"affordability issue\" with public sector pensions, adding that they cannot be sustained at their current level. there was speculation that the report will not recommend a specific retirement date for workers or suggest how much more they should pay into their scheme, despite suggestions that their contributions could more than double in some cases, while the age at which people qualify for a full pension could increase to 65. sources said the report will instead highlight the fact that people are living longer, so it would be logical for the public sector retirement age to be increased, but unions are braced for the review to say that higher contributions and a raised retirement age are the only way to tackle the growing cost of the schemes. the amount workers, such as teachers, nhs staff, local government employees and civil servants, have to pay into the schemes could be increased as early as april. lord hutton was commissioned to carry out the review by chancellor <mark>george osborne</mark>, who warned the \"unsustainable\" rise in the annual bill for public sector schemes must be tackled. tuc general secretary brendan barber said: \"public servants are already facing job cuts, a pay freeze and intensified workloads as staff are not replaced. cuts in their pension provision and increased contributions that lead to a cut in take home pay, at a time when inflation is biting, will add to the volatile cocktail of issues they face .\" unite warned that
