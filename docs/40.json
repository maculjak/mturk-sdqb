though that's probably expected given the difference in age (23 versus 32) and experience. <mark>johnson</mark> finished 13 of 22 for 106 yards with one touchdown and one interception for a 67.6 passer rating. jeremiah trotter, who has played for both philly and tampa, may only play on running downs. defensive coordinator <mark>sean mcdermott</mark>, though, emphasized incumbent starter omar gaither still figures into the plans. \"it's important to understand that omar gaither is a heck of a football player,\" he said. \"and his impact on this defense will not change .\" last game:16 -13 home win vs. tampa bay next up: @ carolina (0-3) at some point soon, however, lewis is expected to make recommendations on how to improve an offense that ranks 27th in the league in scoring with an average of 14 points. owner daniel snyder determined that zorn, who had never been a coordinator or head coach in the nfl before snyder gave him both jobs, needs outside help, and as lewis watches tape, he will develop opinions about zorn's schemes, zorn's ability as a play-caller and the team's talent level. through all the cutler-talk and the loss to the <mark>jason campbell</mark>. \"when there was speculation that we were going to get another guy to come on board and compete against him he worked hard,\" redskins coach jim zorn said. \"so that's just the way it was. he just worked hard, and worked extremely hard to get himself ready. there's never been another issue .\" well, other than the four-turnover game last week, the kind of sloppy effort (albeit in a 16-13 win over tampa bay) that had folks wishing the talk had turned into something tangible. \"up until last game, i was having a pretty good season,\" <mark>campbell</mark> said. \"you couldn't tell, after we won against st. louis, we still got beat up pretty good because we didn't win the way people thought we should have won. but our objective is just to win the game. it's not about how pretty it is. it's just about us winning the game .\" \"it's always good to have all of your guys out there at one time and being on the same page,\" said linebacker na'il diggs. \"<mark>chris</mark> got all of the reps in camp and we kind of got accustomed to his style of play and just hearing his voice. so it's big to get him back. it's good to have somebody back there with a vast knowledge of this defense .\" the panthers have sorely lacked in creating turnovers and that's an area harris has excelled in in the past. he set a team record with eight forced fumbles two years ago. \"i knew the head coach, spags (steve spagnuolo), from when i was in philadelphia, and he said he needed to get some young guys playing and see what they had, so i understood,\" thomas said. \"he said he wished i could have a three-week vacation and come back, but that's not the nature of the business. my agent called carolina and the rest is history, one day old .\" the panthers knew well of thomas' exploits, having faced him as a division rival during three seasons (2006-08) with the new orleans saints. head coach <mark>john fox</mark> also conferred with thomas when he was a free agent on the open market. new york giants (4-0) last game: 27-16 win @ kansas city next up: home vs. oakland (1-3) while some reports suggest that <mark>david carr</mark> would get the start. manning, of course, practiced for the first time this week on friday, taking about half the snaps with the first-team offense during the giants' practice. if he had a setback overnight, the giants probably wouldn't have allowed him to take the field saturday morning. but, when <mark>tom coughlin</mark> addressed reporters on friday, he said he would let manning participate if he had \"made some progress overnight .\" if eli's foot bothers him, the giants will have to rely more on their running game. this is an area the raiders could look to control. [t] he giants will be hard pressed to get off the edge because one of the raiders' few strengths is the play of their des: <mark>richard seymour</mark> and former cowboy <mark>greg ellis</mark>. the giants will have their work cut out for them to block those two, especially since starting te kevin boss likely won't play because of his ankle injury. te <mark>darcy johnson</mark> will have to show off the blocking skills he's developed over the past two years while rookie ot william beatty will have to be a big force as a second te. because of a torn meniscus, giants' lb michel boley will chase blackburn and others are expected to take his place. blackburn technically will replace boley in the starting lineup, but in reality it will take several people to replace what boley was able to do. losing him creates a chain reaction of change throughout the defense. because boley is such an athletic linebacker, he was able to stay on the field in sub packages and help with pass coverage. now the giants likely will take the linebacker off the field in those situations and replace him with safety <mark>michael johnson</mark> as the nickel linebacker. the giants are coming off a five-sack performance against kansas city last week and are allowing just 115 yards passing per game. a matchup against the league's lowest-ranked offense featuring a rebuilt offensive line must have the giants' eyes lighting up. he's the leader of the raider offense. is he? \"yes i feel [i am the leader] because if you look at it, the quarterback touches the ball every play. if i can do the smallest things to get guys in position to become successful, then that's what i look at it as. if anything is not going right, i might get a 2-yard gain or anything just to spark the guys to get going and move forward .\" however, on monday cable all but said the offense has no leaders, \"until the offense finds their leaders, who those guys are going to be, i think you're leadership's gotta come from anywhere on this football team .\" list of injured giants. out: lb michael boley (knee), dt <mark>chris canty</mark> (calf), lb bryan kehl (finger), cb aaron ross (hamstring). doubtful: te kevin boss

audience members alike had participated in a powerful, if heartbreakingly brief, moment of racial harmony. racism has been a nasty undercurrent in plenty of national and local debates over the last

winner, selected by text messages from the audience. of the eight choirs competing, three were mostly white. and one after another, they sang traditionally african-american gospel songs in an african-american style, surprising and delighting the crowd and judges. but it was the choir from festus that brought the audience to its feet. most of the choirs performed wearing colorful choir robes. one was costumed in traditional african garb. all 75 faith baptist choir members walked onstage in either a black cocktail dress or a tuxedo. choir director <mark>michael</mark> nickelson wore

white choir trying to be a black choir,\" he added. the choir began slowly and quietly, harmonizing a gospel classic, andrae crouch's \"soon and very soon .\" then, at the beginning of the second verse, nickelson shed his tails, tossing his coat stage left, just as the choir picked up the tempo. he was in the zone, employing a time-honored african-american choir director tradition of using his entire body to guide his band and singers. he kicked his legs as he summoned certain notes. a mimed pujols-like swing of his arms was a signal for more volume. he may have attempted a moon walk. the crowd roared its approval. choir members got into the spirit, too, clapping and moving their bodies to the music. when faith baptist finished, a standing ovation was unnecessary. audience members were already on their feet. the judges seemed equally amazed. \"i have never seen a white brother move like that,\" said cole, speaking of nickelson's performance. dwight stone, a dj from 100.3 the beat

<mark>jim robinson</mark>, executive vice president of farm bureau insurance. \"more than 2,500 michigan residents, from grade school kids to people almost 90 years old, entered the contest and they really put some thought into it .\" the winning name is mighty mitt, suggested by five michigan residents. the name atlas took second place. trooper, a combination of the nicknames for lower peninsula residents, \"trolls,\" and upper peninsula residents, \"yoopers,\" took third. the contest was especially fun to judge, farm bureau insurance officials say, because each entrant had to explain how he or she came up with the name. for example, one of the names that almost made it to the finals was copper, which not only suggests the animal's copper color, but also refers to michigan's rich copper mining history. ten people entered the name copper. some other names that almost reached the finals were mighty mac (\"the mackinac bridge connects upper and lower michigan so the name shows unity,\"
