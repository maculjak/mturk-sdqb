Little League International announced Wednesday that it is vacating all of the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West squad's wins from last year's tournament, including from the Great Lakes regionals and U.S. championship, because some of its players lived outside its assigned boundaries. Mountain Ridge Little League, out of Las Vegas, officially becomes the 2014 U.S. champ in its place. The international youth baseball organization also suspended <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West's manager, ousted the local district administrator and barred the program from tournament play. Reflecting on what he called \"a heartbreaking decision,\" Little League International President Stephen Keener said the Chicago team's players can still be proud of what they accomplished last year. \"But it is unfortunate that the actions of adults have led to this outcome,\" Keener added. \"...As painful as this is, we feel it a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the Little League program. No team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries.\" <mark>Brandon Green</mark>, a player on the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West team, said the players weren't involved in anything that should cause the squad to be stripped of its title. \"We know that we're champions, our parents know that we're champions...and Chicago knows we're champions,\" he said at a news conference. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Keener and the two spoke for 10 minutes, a spokeswoman for the mayor, Kelley Quinn, said. Emanuel told the Little League official that the players didn't deserve to be punished. The organization should have sanctioned the adults, he said. \"You have turned them into the perpetrators when they are the victims,\" Emanuel told him, according to his spokeswoman. \"You know what they have done for Chicago, and let's face it, you know what they've done for your tournament.\" Named for the icon who broke baseball's color barrier and consisting entirely of African-Americans, the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West squad proved that, despite talk to the contrary, baseball was not dead among inner-city youth. The Illinois team earned raves after knocking out Sports Illustrated cover girl Mo \"ne Davis' Philadelphia team and rolling to the U.S. championship contest. It entered that game as an underdog to Las Vegas, which had beaten every team it faced--including crushing Chicago by a 13-2 score. The title game was a much more even affair. The two squads swapped leads before Chicago jumped ahead for good with a three-run fifth inning en route to a 7-5 win. In the World Series final the following day, <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West rallied late but couldn't overcome the eventual champions from South Korea. That loss didn't halt the positive feelings about the team. Everyone from former Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer <mark>Frank Thomas</mark> and longtime Obama adviser <mark>David Axelrod</mark> cheered their success. Emanuel credited\" their positive attitude and success on the field (for rallying) people from every neighborhood. \"The team was celebrated with a parade through their hometown and even a visit to the White House in November, where they met President Barack Obama, a Chicago resident. At the time of the Washington visit, local Little League officials were already investigating thanks to a tip from a neighboring district's official and documentation. Little League International initially determined that all of <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West's players were eligible. In the middle of December, though,\" Little League began to learn of multiple issues with boundary maps and operational process with multiple leagues in Illinois District 4, \"the international organization said in a statement. Several more meetings followed, including one on January 31 when several issues came up, including that\" <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West Little League used a falsified boundary map for their 2014 tournament and that <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West Little League officials met with other leagues in District 4 to try to get the territory they wrongfully claimed was theirs for their 2014 tournament. \"\"During our review, it became clear that both <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West officials and (the) District Administrator...signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been,\" Keener said.

According to a report by Wired, researchers at a digital security conference Friday revealed a difficult-to-detect BIOS attack called LightEater that leaves YouTube / hdgadget) When you turn on your computer, the BIOS - which stands for basic input/output system - helps your computer get going. It loads up your operating system - like Microsoft Windows - and helps the computer communicate with the stuff you've plugged into it: the display, the keyboard, the mouse, etc.. The hack works by infecting this basic input/output system. It's particularly worrisome because software designed to protect your computer from viruses doesn't typically scan the BIOS; it scans the operating system loaded by the BIOS. So if hackers can infect the BIOS, they are - in theory - capable of loading malware onto your system undetected. And here's the kicker, via Wired: \"The vulnerabilities...were so easy to find that they wrote a script to automate the process and eventually stopped counting [them] because there were too many.\" The problem is people aren't updating their BIOS when manufacturers make updates available. That leaves dozens of openings for hackers, which result in millions of vulnerable computers. \"To check the setup version from Windows, go to the Start screen and type\" msinfo32 .'

Journey times will be cut, frequencies increased and new routes added across the country following infrastructure investment and upgraded carriages. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the new timetable change will feature 1,000 extra weekly services, on top of the 4,000 introduced over the past two years. Train timetables are changed twice a year, in May and December. The launch of the May 2018 timetables saw services crippled in parts of the North and the South East, with blame attributed to Network Rail, train operators and the Government. <mark>Anthony Smith</mark>, chief executive of the passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: \"This time around passengers need the rail industry to deliver a smooth set of timetable improvements--so they can reliably use both new and existing services.\" Many passengers should have a greater choice of services with more seats as result of these changes. However, there will also be some who lose out with fewer or slower services. \"Train companies must have plenty of visible staff on hand to guide passengers, to answer questions on how these changes will affect them, and to explain what travel choices they have.\" The RDG sought to reassure passengers over the upcoming timetable, stating that the industry has put \"years of work into drafting, consulting and planning for these changes\" . <mark>Robert Nisbet</mark>, the organisation's director of nations and regions, urged passengers to check their journey details in advance as many times are changing. He added: \"Train operators and Network Rail will be working together to run a reliable service and respond quickly to any teething problems as people get used to the change.\" Sunday will see the biggest timetable change on the Great Western Railway network since the 1970s, taking advantage of Network Rail's electrification of the line between London and Bristol, and the operator's new intercity express trains. Non-stop trains between London Paddington and Bristol Parkway will have journey times as short as one hour and eight minutes, shaving 12 minutes off the existing quickest services. Fastest journey times between the capital and Bristol Temple Meads--near the centre of the city--will be cut by 17 minutes to one hour and 19 minutes. The frequency of trains on this routes will be increased from two per hour to three during the morning and evening peaks. There will be major improvements on the ScotRail network, with additional services in north-east Scotland and extra seats between Edinburgh and Glasgow. A new station, Robroyston, will open in north-east Glasgow on the line between Queen Street and Cumbernauld. Other operators introducing new services are Greater Anglia, London North Eastern Railway, Northern, TfL Rail, Thameslink, Transpennine Express (TPE), Transport for Wales, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway. TPE admitted last week that the frequency of its new direct Liverpool-Edinburgh trains will initially be lower than the planned hourly service. The firm blamed a maintenance backlog and infrastructure problems for delaying crew training, as well as the late delivery of new trains. 0 comment"}]
