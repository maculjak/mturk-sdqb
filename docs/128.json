same, old way, and expecting new, and different results. they have to do something to get this team excited, and orton just isn't cutting it as team leader. hey, when they have a chance to win, and the offense goes three-and-out on three plays that weren't even close, that hurts morale. it's hard to have confidence in a guy who goes 6-13 for 34 yards with one interception, and is tied for the league lead in interceptions. i do not put all of the onus on orton, but it is the job of the qb to be the team leader, to be the spark in offensive engine, and to rally the troops when it's rally time. orton may be the best qb they have, and their best option under center in terms of talent, ability, and experience, but, when it comes to motivating a team, and getting them to believe they can win, orton isn't cutting it and has lost the confidence not only of the fans, but of his teammates as well. orton won the job in training camp, and pretty much came out and stunk up the place on the way to a 1-4 record at the bye. watching <mark>jay cutler</mark> on monday night, and realizing that his offensive line was as bad or worse than the broncos, and also realizing that he was finding ways to overcome that when orton could not even come close really sealed the deal for me. orton gives up too easily, and resigns himself to, \"there's nothing i can do,\" but tebow, no matter how much he still has yet to learn will take whatever you give him, and keep trying no matter what. i truly can't believe it. the fans in denver really do run the football team. how else do you explain a 3rd string qb jumping to starter with no injuries involve? orton and quinn should both be asking for trades. of course, if i ran the team i would trade all 3. i could care less about entertainment. i want the team to win. that is the point of this sport. okay, please tell us what trades you would make, which qarterback out there you could aquire and how you would teach him the offense fast enough that he would have a better chance of winning the current qb. with the records of the past coaching staffs, the fans can do just a good a job...rathbone7 wrote: i truly can't believe it. the fans in denver

sound like you're from denver or have much invested in our broncos, so you can leave whenever you'd like. second, it was obviously clear that tebow in no way was ever \"3rd string\" , like many on these boards tried to claim (scott silver also said he was 4th string???? yeah good call silver). <mark>fox</mark> came out and literally said anyone who thought he was 3rd string was just flat out wrong. <mark>fox</mark> hasnt really handled this teams affairs all that well.he seems to be a day late and a dollar short all the time. i give him bringing miller in...but thats it. where is this high powered running game/sure mcaghee is running his off. . but i doubt hell last the season this way. moreno has become a reciever. wheres ball in all this? seldom seen. he played ortons card till he literly had to pull the guy from embarassment. trying to prove some damn thing??? for being known as a great defensive coach...im not seeing it. it looks to me like, these guys are trying but they are doing it on fumes...from other organaizations and their own knowledge. wheres is the <mark>john fox</mark> stamp on this defense? im a little mcd!!! again!!! he does chew gum rather well...with an open mouth...nice...i will admit i supported mcdaniels and orton more than both deserve. with the lockout, coaching change and a pretty bare bones football team i can't really blame coach <mark>fox</mark> for the current teams lackluster play. as fans we know of the major problems the broncos have been going through and most would agree we need a franchise qb to start, but we also know how pathetic the defense was and how porous our o-line and terrible running game has been. orton earned the opportunity to be the starting quarterback, he simply couldn't produce with it. therefore, <mark>fox</mark> has to make this change and that change has to be tebow. when you have an \"o'\" line that can't block and receivers who can't get open, a quarterback that can run is your only options. broncocrusader wrote: mr mojo risin wrote: might be a good idea for those of us who have been calling for tim to start to get a little thick skinned ourselves. probably gonna be some asinine

and should keep their thought to themselves anyone who \"gave orton more credit that he deserved\" especially after his last two seasons should have their nfl viewing rights stripped. face it, your ttds prevented you from seeing what was right in front of you. irrational hate can do that to ya. you wanted orton to be good, in the face of his recent history, because it would have justified your hate of tt. how'd that delusion work out for ya? there are no \"tebow\" fans, as much as you and the few remaining ttdsers would like to believe. the fact that you can't name names or point to posts tells you that. the reality is we are bronco fans who thought the best interest of the franchise was in finding out what tebow can do on the football field for a whole season before throwing away 3 drafts on another qb. but again, ttds prevented you from seeing the reality of the situation. even now you can't admit you were wrong, and only grudgingly give \"tebow fans\" credit. does the fact that i joined this board in 2009, while tt was still in college, mean anything to you, or does your ttds require you to just dismiss facts if they don't fit your delusion? johnnyk7 wrote: ok, so tebow had to shake off a little rust in the third quarter. no problem, it s/b expected. a few bobbled exchanges under center are ok. we want him in there to learn and give us the entertainment of days gone past. i remember elway doing the same thing when he was first starting out. shucks, on occaision, <mark>john</mark> used to line up under the guard instead of the center. the way i see it, three or four passes should have been caught by our receivers (even though they were a little under thrown). 95% of the time, if it hits them in two hands, it should be caught. end of story. boy-oh-boy, i especially wish decker wouldve caught his. even more so, i wish that he had one more step when he stormed in towards the right side of the endzone on the last play of the game and ultimately redeemed himself by catching the winning touchdown. decker & tebow have a pretty good chance to become a thing of legends just like elway & sharpe, or elway & smith, or elway and mccaffery. tim has all of the intangibles. tim is a student of the game. i do not know about you all, but i can see the difference already in regards to tebow staying in the pocket and looking for the receivers first before taking off. he showed it in the pre-season and he showed it on sunday. he is the kind of person that will not let himself fail. here's what i'd like to see happen. we finally trade orton to miami in the next two weeks. he starts for miami agianst us, against tebow, and von miller is unleashed on him hmmmm, it could happen. wishful thinking! hey, by the way, when rivers fumbled the ball and we got it overturned by the refs, would you not enforce the kenny stabler rule (wink) \"he gave us a spark. that's tim tebow,\" running back willis mcgahee said afterward. \"everybody's been cheering for him for the longest, and now he finally got in and came in and moved the ball for us .\" careful there willis, that almost sounds like the locker room was pulling for tebow from the start. of course willis is a miami product and should be a big supporter of tebow. i also think kuper is in that category. why it seemed as if the whole team played harder after tebow came in as qb. who could possibly imaging such a metamorphosis. well maybe some of those stupid fans. you know the one's that aren't the coaches. the one's who should just sit back and shut up, because the coaches are the professionals, and.... yada,...yada,...yada .>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> spider wrote: the last 2 1/2 half years have been very frustrating and trying for all bronco

think the previous posters comment has validity to it. no matter what tim does in the coming weeks, there will be people (yourself included most likely) that will still scrutinize his faults. he could

one of his clients to build a case to withhold public records sought by the dispatch. the newspaper's request for records surrounding american electric power's potential rate-hike settlement before the public utilities commission of ohio led the utilty and others to petition the puco to shield the records from release as trade secrets. however, dewine said yesterday that it appears the records must be released and that any move to deny the records would have to be justified by strong legal arguments that do not appear at hand. iran injected a new twist yesterday into the week-old u.s. accusation of an iranian plot to assassinate the saudi ambassador to washington, asserting that one of the defendants actually belongs to an outlawed and exiled opposition group. the defendant, gholam shakuri, identified by the justice department as an operative of the elite quds force of iran's revolutionary guards corps, is a \"key member\" of the muhajedeen-khalq, iran's mehr news agency reported. the agency did not explain the group's possible motive but implied that the plot was a bogus scheme meant to ostracize iran. it said shakuri, who is at large, was last seen in washington and in camp ashraf, the group's enclave in iraq. \"the person in question has been traveling to different countries under the names of ali shakuri/gholam shakuri/gholam-hussein shakuri by using fake passports including forged iranian passports,\" mehr said. u.s. officials did not comment on the mehr report. mark toner, a state department spokesman, reiterated the u.s. view in washington that \"this was a serious breach of international law and that iran needs to be held accountable .\" the opposition group itself dismissed the mehr report as nonsense. shahin gobadi, a spokesman, wrote in an email that \"this is a well-known tactic that has been used by the mullahs in the past 30 years where they blame their crimes on their opposition for double gains .\" the group, also known as the national council of resistance of iran, is regarded by iran as a violent insurgent organization with a history of assassinations and sabotage aimed at overthrowing the islamic government that took power in 1979. although the group says it renounced violence a decade ago, it is still classified as a foreign terrorist organization by the state department, but not by britain or the european union. it maintains a headquarters in paris. mehr said it had learned what it called the new information about shakuri from interpol but gave no details. calls and emailed queries to interpol were not immediately returned. if shakuri were a member of the opposition group, it would embarrass the united states, which announced the suspected plot with some fanfare a week ago. in a televised news conference, attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> said u.s. investigators thought that high-level officials in iran were responsible. the justice department has accused shakuri and mansour j. arbabsiar, a naturalized iranian-american citizen from corpus christi, texas, of conspiring to hire assassins from a mexican drug gang for $1.5 million. u.s. officials have acknowledged that the suspected plot sounds hard to believe but asserted they have the evidence to back it up. saudi arabia has accused iran of a \"dastardly\" scheme, and other u.s. allies say they take the accusation

ferocious predators on the prowl over night in ohio echoes a similar scare on the southeastern idaho border 16 years ago, and it represents the kind of nightmare scenario that utah laws are intended to prevent. the real-life safari hunt in zanesville, ohio, started tuesday night when terry thompson opened the gates and cages at his animal farm, where he had permits to house exotic animals. according to investigators, he then shot himself to death. lions, bears, leopards and wolves ran loose, leaving a community in terror and barricaded in their homes. \"it's like noah's ark wrecking right here in zanesville, ohio,\" said wildlife expert jack hanna. all the animals were either killed or recaptured, with one exception - a monkey that's still on the loose. a similar episode in idaho struck fear into residents of lava hot springs in 1995. nineteen lions, tigers and hybrid \"ligers\" escaped from a ramshackle facility known as \"ligertown .\" the privately owned collection of chicken-wire and plywood enclosures proved to be far too insecure to hold such dangerous predators. idaho deputies killed the last of the escaped cats several days later when it was found at a local elementary school, evidently stalking prey. officials in utah say a tough wild-animal law here protects the public. \"the state law in utah is very strict,\" said mark hadley of the utah division of wildlife resources. \"basically it prohibits people from being able to have wild and dangerous animals in their possession .\" it wasn't always so. <mark>john paul</mark> fox, chief investigator for the humane society of utah, remembers numerous private zoos and wild animal collections in the 1970s and 1980s. \"they were a big concern for us,\" fox said. \"dirty cages, lack of veterinary care, poor diets .\" the facilities were typically roadside tourist attractions or animal suppliers to movie companies. \"there was a lack of security in all those facilities,\" fox said. \"you could just drive on the site, walk in among the grizzly bears or jaguars or cougars. there would be nobody there the whole time you'd be there at the facility .\" ", "articleID": "2011102101_00061545_W",

data to back up his theories is a good thing. presenting his economic analysis to peer reviewed forums backed by old-fashioned data analysis and appropriate case control should be welcomed. this is a welcome departure from some of the overreaching that drives his nyt columns. yea but the inequality gap is a function of all administrations (the \"clinton miracle\" for example) whereby good natured ideas to bridge the gap starting with innocuous concepts like sub prime mortgages. nicely done wouldn't you agree...now look at greece, they were fronted mountains of cash so that they could bridge the inequality gap to western europe. they took the money. they squandered and looted the money and got nowhere. nowhere except in deep debt. both of these and cast of a thousand more were instrumental in creating bubbles and financial crisis. you think cdos were the playthings of bank geeks? in part true, but they were products to help the poor raise their standard of living through access to credit. of course it was a disaster every step of the way. but again, a major component introduced to bridge the gap .: perhaps a better question is how did the wealth-income inequality gap become so wide that the bottom 47% have even less to pay in taxes. whatever happened to trickle down economics? where have real wages gone in the last 40 years? how can you expect wages to fall and incomes and therefore taxable incomes to increase? complete nonsense. of course the population will pay less in taxes if they have less of the wealth from earning less in income, since their jobs of course were off-shored. not to mention lax standards in regards to illegal immigration. you wanted to destroy the middle class, and now your complaining about negative effects on the tax base? if you don't have the taxpayers you don't have a tax base. so why should unearned income not be taxed, relative to earned income? what gives speculators more of a right to gamble on land and equities than investing back into industry? why should real investment and income from work be discouraged? this is a bunch of baloney republican talking points. in a 35 year career as a partner in a cpa firm, dealing with thousands of businessmen, i never met one who was going to close up shop because he was only going to get to keep 58 cents out of every dollar of profit instead of 60 cents. the reason why business isn't expanding is because it's laying off. if you have overcapacity, particularly if it's debt-financed, it doesn't make much sense to add more people and build more capacity when you can't keep your current facilities or people busy. yes. but this time the elites have learned their lesson and they will not let slip their gold-plated boots from the bloodied faces of the middle and working classes. rushbo economics part one: what is not class warfare: cutting pay, eliminating benefits, increasing job demands, buying productive companies to saddle them with debt in order to raise $$$to play the markets, outsourcing jobs, exporting industries, employing illegal immigrants, transfering losses onto the govt. you nailed it. some day, i hope the average american can see beyond the propaganda machine meant to \"keep them in their place\" and supporting an economic regime that does nothing but screw them over. a lot of piss but no vinegar...so what to do? let china eat our lunch eight days a week so that we can make sure that american workers make $45 an hour to produce something in 12 other countries (including china) can produce for $3? you sound like you're running for office. you make good points in a vacuum. i'm not suggesting i have the answers to your question but i can certainly tell you that the era of all those things you pine for is certainly gone. you aren't going to put toothpaste back into the tube. thanks alphadirected. you really taught me how to construct an argument \"you aren't going to put toothpaste back into the tube .\" wow, that sure is mighty big thinking skills you got there. hard to argue with such airtight logic. economics and toothpaste. why didn't i see the similarity? it all begins to make sense when you think of economic problems as being similar if not identical to toothpaste problems. \"being a california resident my entire life, i will tell you with full authority that the latinos built this fucking state .\" wow, another great argument. i'm to suppose to take it on your authority that this bit of nonsense is true? and the gratitutious profanity is intended to make your argument even more irrefutable? brillant! while i understand latinos--or as they refer to themselves, the race--are a super race to which all other ethnic groups must bow and whimper, i will not do so. latinos are no better or worse than any other ethnic group. \"if you took every latino laborer and immigrant (illegal or otherwise) and shipped them back to where they came from, the state would entirely collapse in two weeks. forget their energy input, just look at what would happen to the tax base when you take them out of buying products at 9.75% sales tax or buying gasoline both of which you can't get around due to citizenship. economic collapse post haste. faster than already happening if that's possible...\"oh so true, and the fact that they duck income taxes doesn't change a thing. and it would be hateful to point out that while they routinely duck out of paying income taxes, they still make full use of the state roads, highways, schools, hospitals, etc. and so, in conclusion, you don't have any solutions but the john mccain solution: wring your hands and whimper,\" the jobs are gone and ain't coming back., the jobs are gone and aint coming back. . \"nice. the indians, mexicans and chinese must giggle at such american economic defeatism. what did you just say? as far as i can tell you derided my opinion because of all of it's\" big thinking skills \". then you went on and on about who knows what and then completely distorted the latino issue. in fact your understanding of the immigration issue looks to be taken directly from a tea party genius that heard about it on fox. btw. the latinos (or any immigrant) cannot duck out of sales tax nor can they duck out of paying taxes at the pump etc. if you've got some empirical evidence saying they take more in taxes than they give, then lets fucking see it. and don't show us any of that sexed up crap from those heritage foundation goof balls. look, i don't have an answer to an infinitely complex situation. nor do you--so quit with the populist\" well if americans were just smarter \"mentality bullshit. i'm not wringing my hands in defeat at all. that's your ridiculous assumption to be piled atop your other ridiculous assumptions. well genius, if the latinos built california the stats show they did a pretty poor job. with all those high priced players in la, frisco, and silicon valley paying big tax bills the state is still going broke. is broke. wonder how all those busted hospitals would fare if your beloved illegals would pay their hospital bills instead of skipping out. no mention by you of the large latino gangs home grown in california that now have their tentacles in most of the us and south of the border. i live in a small city of 8000 2000 miles from the border. we have had a latino presence here for over 50 years. officially we are over 20% latino. reality says closer to 30. one city 20 miles south of here is officially 40%. from experience i can say your claim that latinos are super workers is just plain crap. i've worked shoulder to shoulder with these people and they aren't even average. when the boss isn't looking you can't find them. when the boss comes around they brown nose the hell out of him so he doesn't see their lack of activity. quality isn't in their vocabulary. employers want illegals because they are too scared to do anything but work hard and endure your arrogance and incompetence. sounds like you employ gobs of illegals and are pissed cause you can't get enough of them. hey einstein, 1) only dolts and hells angel types call san francisco\" frisco \"...2) california is going broke because the ca government is retarded. it isn't about not paying enough taxes, it's about the\" smash and grab \"techniques used by both democrats and republicans alike with no regard or care about the state at large. i've got a $13mm bike path being put in in my community and we just voted on a $1bn yes that's one billion dollar! public transit train going to a community with 240 people in it! looks great supporting\" public transit \"so the mental midgets in sacto jumped on. the most expensive public transit train on the planet. no shit. hello, this is our problem--not some latino guy working for $9 an hour sending money back to mexico to his family. 3) i'm sorry you are working\" shoulder to shoulder with illegal aliens \"maybe your outlook would look a little rosier if you had a better job. just a thought. anyhow, your personal ancedotal evidence is meaningless in public policy. give us a an actual number of how many latinos run out on their hospital bill. now give us a number in how much latinos pay in sales and fuel taxes that can never be avoided. 4) american workers overpaid compared to chinese workers ignorant? are you a union shop steward touting union rhetoric? hey einstein, chinese workers are paid less than american workers thereby american workers are paid too much for the same work. do you want your iphone to cost $1,200 or do you want to pay $199? i'm not making up any rules here or saying anything that isn't obvious. don't hate the player--hate the game. and btw, your final statement reveals that you are a union mouthpiece spouting the same ol tired shit as the ship goes down. 5) look at solar energy in this state. an important industry across many fronts. president obama is using solar as a pillar of his\" green revolution \"the electrical union has stepped in and lobbied to have all the workers on a solar installation be union workers. they say\" we need strong union labor to be involved in green energy and to promote american hard work and the families they support \"fine. then the solar industry realized it would raise the cost on each job anywhere from 50-100% per job and it would kill the solar industry. nobody could afford solar with the increase. so the union says when asked about the crippling cost increases\" we need strong union labor to be involved in green energy and to promote american hard work and the families they support \"...they want to kill an entire industry and have no jobs for their members rather than be rational. as they've done over and over and over. how many industries have they destroyed now? the us does not benefit from such trade whatsoever, only a few executives and wall street benefit from the current dynamic. as the industrial output of the nation declines so does the ability for the nation to maintain its current living standards and tax base. so the ability to even service debt decreases. this forces an increase in credit growth whereby foreign goods are purchased with debt. you wanted your free market and free trade? now you have to live with the consequences. the enormous racked due to companies not willing to house operations in the us. why? labor costs. period. you are not looking at the big picture, you're simply looking at your flawed and failed neoliberal model. so china's macro policy decisions are of no consequence? free trade is a one way street to deindustrialization. the us was built on protectionism. from 1776 up until the end of ww2 and even more so up until the end of 1971 the us was once of the most protectionist nations on earth. all major industrial developed nations were developed through protectionism. governments when properly managed (i.e not under neo-liberalism, but under checks and balances, regulation, etc) are non-profit entities. unless you want to get into pinochet's endeavors. businesses are free to move to haiti. tax rates and regulation were at all time highs for them during the 50s and 60s, where did they go? they stayed right in the us. do you know why? it's the same exact reason why enterprises do not move from china (even though labor costs have been increasing over the past few years) to countries in southern asia, south america or africa. there is no infrastructure in those third world nations to handle the capacity the enterprise needs to move. government investment into infrastructure actually lowers their costs of production. why doesn't the free market invest in infrastructure? investments in infrastructure are considered to be quite terrible as a general rule of thumb by private investors. they almost always turn sour during recessions and usually go bankrupt in the free market. the only investors that actually stand to make a profit are the scavengers that buy them up on mere fractions of their original investment values. if labor was not needed then businesses wouldn't hire that labor period. if labor is needed for certain tasks then businesses simply must pay the difference instead of taking as much income from labor as possible and paying it out in dividends. businesses make profits after-tax. if they want to share in the growth of a region they will pay the necessary taxes. businesses will go wherever they find the most opportunity, if they want to exploit (i.e speculate instead of making capital investments) it then they don't have to share their benefits. no an increase in wages does not result in an increase in the price of the end product. this has been proved wrong time and time again. if a business is to be competitive in the market place and meet demand it cannot rise prices instead that will eat the cost of the wages. capitalism is about capitalists maximizing profits at the expense of all else. what the unions would like is keeping the real wage promised to them 40 years ago when the free-trade and deregulation business started. what they are seeing now is that the neoliberal models have been shown to be totally broken. the pension underfunding has more to do with faith in the stock market and the management of corporations, that is the risk taken with defined benefit contribution plans. no doubt managers looking out short term profits don't mind borrowing from workers pensions. it's a similar situation to what we have with ss and medicare. for the last 40 + years ever since lbj started spending taxes alloted to the ss and medicare trusted funds into the general fund for mostly military-industrial complex spending. he doesn't explain it at all, but someone a lot better does here:\" if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. \"- copy to clipboard\" paper is poverty,...it is only the ghost of money, and not money itself.

(ap)--michael waltrip said it was a good thing brother darrell wasn't around to defend himself at a charity roast. otherwise, nobody would have gone home until the wee hours of the morning after the man nicknamed jaws had finished responding. as michael said about his brother, darrell sure can talk. nascar president mike helton, x games gold medalist and future nationwide driver travis pastrana, kyle petty and comedian <mark>ron white</mark> were among those at the waltrip brothers' charity championship dinner wednesday night with darrell the man being roasted in honor of his january induction into the nascar hall of fame. darrell was called away on business and missed the silent auction and dinner wednesday night. he also will miss golf outing thursday, benefiting motor racing outreach and victory junction gang camp. his brother made sure everyone knew not to look around for darrell, announcing at the start: \"he ain't here .\" \"he gave me something to shoot for and made me know leaving owensboro, ky., with a dream was possible,\" michael said about his big brother, who won 84 cup races and three championships. \"he certainly made a difference in my life. we're here to honor darrell, and he didn't show up .\" darrell did get in the last word with a videotaped response from australia where he is working for fox, and he went on long enough that his brother asked once how much longer dw would go. \"i'm glad you guys had fun at my expense,\" darrell said. \"i'm out. i'm out representing the sport. i'm out spreading the gospel. i'm out being a good ambassador for nascar and for what we do while y' all are sitting there feeding your faces .\" darrell said he almost speechless at his brother setting him up to be roasted. he pointed out he owned the car michael won his first race in at dover. \"if i was there, i would be so embarrassed,\" darrell said. \"but i'm not and i wouldn't have been .\" he might have. helton shared details on how cale yarbrough started calling darrell \"jaws\" for how much he talked. helton also said nascar officials breathed a sigh of relief when darrell retired from racing as a driver until fox signed him to a contract. helton also joked that darrell put the pressure on until finally being voted in as a member of the hall of fame's third class. \"i'm especially not going to roast a guy who has a microphone every sunday and has the opportunity to pay me back and who by the way doesn't need an opportunity to,\" helton said. the night had plenty of star power even at the silent auction tables with an autographed guitar by singer darius rucker, a cowboy hat from richard petty, and gear from dale earnhardt jr., <mark>martin</mark> truex, <mark>mark martin</mark> and denny hamlin. as the roasting began, someone pretended to be darrell dressed in a fire suit and wearing a helmet. nascar team owner rick hendrick, who won nine races with darrell driving for him over four years, pointed out by video that country singer brad paisley chose jeff gordon to drive his race car in a music video leaving darrell to drive a four-wheeler. \"i know that you are one of the all-time winningest drivers in nascar. you tell us that every week on tv,\" hendrick said. attorney ed silva, who helped negotiate darrell out of a contract to sign with junior johnson, said darrell texted him on his way to australia. \"he said good luck. under no circumstance am i waiving the attorney-client privilege,\" silva said before wadding up a couple pieces of paper and tossing them away. print print email email this article share tweet facebook share share! x digg delicious myspace google buzz linkedin stumbleupon newsvine reddit next article wheldon's death returns safety issue to forefront", "articleID": "2011102114_00114740_W", "names": {"Mark Martin": ["Q16200207", "Q6768736", "Q6768737", "Q6768738", "Q719186"], "Ron White": ["Q16937459", "Q3441473", "Q7364531"]}}]
