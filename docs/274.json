Giroud has not played since the end of August when he suffered a broken tibia in the 2-2 draw with Everton, having scored minutes before the injury to salvage a point for the Gunners. The French striker's absence led to Wenger making a deadline day move for Danny Welbeck, with the England international joining the North London club from United for \u00a3 16m. Arsenal's injury list Ahead of the game against their fierce rivals, Wenger revealed that both Giroud and club captain Mikel Arteta are available after injury, and there was also positive news regarding the progress of defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny. \"Giroud and Arteta are both available,\" Wenger told www.arsenal.com. \"It's just a question of how ready they are. But they are available. Olivier Giroud is back in training\" He [Giroud] is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year. So he's one month ahead. \"Koscielny and Debuchy are doing well, they are out on the field [working] again. We have to see now. Usually field work is three weeks away from full group training. Then there is fitness. It looks straightforward for Debuchy. It's not inflammation, it's just repairing surgery. For Koscielny, it depends how well he responds to training. At the moment he looks good .\" Wenger defends Ozil and Diaby Wenger added that both Welbeck and \u00a3 35m Alexis Sanchez have helped the Gunners deal with the absence of their lead striker, but stressed that the return of both the France international and a fit-again Theo Walcott. When asked if they had relied on Welbeck, Wenger said: \"Yes, and on Sanchez as well. But we have Giroud back, we have Walcott back. Slowly they <mark>will</mark> integrate into the team again and give us different options. Welbeck has scored five goals since joining Arsenal Finally, Wenger gave a brief update on injured midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil as he continues to recover from a serious knee injury sustained in the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea. However, Wenger did concede that the timescale for his return still stretches into next year .\" Ozil is doing well but he <mark>will</mark> not be ready before the start of 2015, \"Wenger said.
