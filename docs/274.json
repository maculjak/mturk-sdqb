Manomet, based in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is proposing the shellfish shift as a way to beat predators that plague Maine's clam diggers. Seafood lovers have sought Maine's softshell clams in chowders and clam rolls for decades, but wild harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers along the Maine coast to grow quahogs, study the results and bring the bivalves to market. \"Wouldn't it make sense to branch out and do this new species? One of the things that attracted us to quahogs was they seem to be less susceptible to predation from green crabs and marine worms,\" said Marissa McMahan, marine fisheries division director for Manomet, referencing a pair of pests that eat softshell clams. Shellfish farming is already common along the Maine coast, but quahog farming isn't practiced extensively. There were more than 90 shellfish leases in Maine totaling more than 700 acres last year, but the industry is dominated by oyster and mussel farming. Quahog farming is making money in Massachusetts, where state records show the value of farmed quahogs topped $1 million in 2017. Quahogs are also harvested wild in the ocean and tidal areas off the East Coast, and they're popular stuffed, steamed and in chowders. The shellfish also lends its name to a fictional Rhode Island town on the animated series \"Family Guy .\" The federal government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sea Grant program has taken notice of Manomet's idea and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost. McMahan said the group provided the farmers with seed quahogs last month, and the shellfish are growing in Harpswell, Georgetown and West Bath farms. The first market-size quahogs are expected in 2021. Jordan Kramer, operator of the West Bath farm, said the growth of quahog aquaculture could help the state's farmers diversify. His farm, Winnegance Oyster Farm, was already raising some quahogs prior to joining the Manomet project, and the first bunch has reached maturity. \"It's a new option \ufffd a local option for an aquaculture product,\" Kramer said. Quahogs are still vulnerable to predators, such as green crabs, especially when they are young and small, said Brian Beal, a professor marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. So farmers are growing the quahogs in bags located in 10 to 30 feet of water, McMahan said. That will help protect them from the crabs, which prey on wild shellfish when they settle in mud. The growth of predators has become a bigger problem for softshell clams as the waters of the Gulf of Maine have warmed. The harvest fell to 1.4 million pounds, the lowest in decades, in 2017. The loss of the softshell clams has forced clammers to adapt, said <mark>Chad Campbell</mark>, one of the farmers working with Manomet on the quahog project in Georgetown. <mark>Campbell</mark> has dug for clams for 30 years and witnessed wild clamming fade as a way of life in Maine. \"We've seen the decline,\" he said. \"You can't rely on the wild harvest.

Will she actually use it? The alternative is to abandon her own justice system, subjecting her prelates to the vagaries of secular justice. Which might just mean no justice at all. As Pope Francis marks his sixth anniversary, a pressing issue in the year ahead will be to defend the Church's canonical processes, an unexpected turn for a pope who famously lacks enthusiasm for legal precision. The case of Theodore McCarrick, the former cardinal now laicised, demonstrates that the Church's own canon law does not require the secular justice system to operate. From start to finish, the McCarrick case was entirely handled within the Church and, until the formal trial at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, proceeded largely under the lay review board in the Archdiocese of New York. Indeed, in McCarrick's case, it is unlikely that there will be any processes in either criminal or civil courts. Cardinal George Pell has been convicted on what is widely believed--by many including this writer--to be a gross miscarriage of justice, the product of police and prosecutorial bias. Should Pell's appeal fail, there will be enormous pressure for the Church's canonical system to arrive at the same verdict. But what if the canonical process finds Pell not guilty, as would be likely? Will the Church abide by her own justice system? The case of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin adds another twist. Cardinal Barbarin has long acknowledged that he mishandled a case of priestly abuse. Those facts are not in doubt. The relevant prosecutor declined to criminally prosecute, finding that there was not the necessary criminal intent. In a quirk of the French system, the criminal case was brought anyway, and a panel of judges convicted Barbarin while acquitting all his co-defendants. Barbarin intends to appeal the verdict, but has also said that he will resign as Archbishop of Lyons. Should Barbarin's future depend on the French criminal justice system? If he had been acquitted presumably he would not offer his resignation. So the decision to resign depends on the French courts, but not a Church canonical process. It is likely that Barbarin quickly announced that he would resign because of the experience of <mark>Philip Wilson</mark>, the Archbishop of Adelaide. Convicted of not reporting sexual abuse last July, he announced that he would appeal and remain in office. Enormous pressure--in the Church and from wider Australian society--forced him to offer his resignation, which the Holy See quickly accepted. A few months later, Archbishop <mark>Wilson</mark> was acquitted on appeal, with the judge ruling that the original conviction was tainted by the current anti-clerical frenzy in Australia. All of which poses a critical question for the Church. Does she have enough confidence in her own canon law to defend judgments which might be at variance with secular proceedings? Especially when it appears that justice has not been done--as has been demonstrated with <mark>Wilson</mark>, is certainly true with Pell and likely true with Barbarin? The question extends beyond the most recent cases. In facing cases of misconduct--not only sexual--the practical abandonment of canonical processes in the 1960s onwards was a major factor in the current crises. In 2010, dealing with the Irish abuse crisis, Benedict XVI made that point in the interview book Light of the World. \"The Archbishop of Dublin [Diarmuid Martin] told me something very interesting about [the mishandling of sexual abuse cases],\" Benedict said. \"He said that ecclesiastical penal law functioned until the late 1950s; admittedly it was not perfect--there is much to criticise about it--but nevertheless it was applied. After the mid-60s, however, it was simply not applied any more...the prevailing mentality was that the Church must not be a Church of laws but, rather, a Church of love; she must not punish. Thus the awareness that punishment can be an act of love ceased to exist. This led to an odd darkening of the mind, even in very good people .\" The same diagnosis--that canon law was simply abandoned--was reached by the Irish government's Murphy Commission report into abuse in the Archdiocese of Dublin. It wasn't until the mid-1990s that canonical punishments began to be applied again. This was for priestly misconduct though, not for failings in the oversight of bishops. In 2016, Pope Francis implemented legislation to deal with cases of bishops who either were accused of sexual misconduct, or were negligent or malfeasant in handling such cases. In 2018, he said that he preferred not to use those measures. In the case of Cardinal Barbarin those measures, if used, might have deposed him from office even with an acquittal at criminal law, as the canonical standards for conviction are much lower than criminal ones. Alternatively, a canonical process could have decided on a remedy short of resignation, even with a criminal conviction. The Church fought for many centuries to keep clerics out of the jurisdiction of secular courts altogether. She no longer does that. The question now is whether clerics will be treated, de facto, by secular courts alone, and be kept out of the canonical justice system.

Friday, March 9, 2018. Advocate staff photo by MATTHEW HINTON TownNews.com Content Exchange Facebook Twitter Email Print Save There was a noticeable lack of scoring, and eyebrow, in the Smoothie King Center. <mark>Anthony Davis</mark> was sidelined due to a sprained ankle, and the New Orleans Pelicans' 10-game winning streak came crashing alongside of him. <mark>Davis</mark> could only watch from the sidelines as the streak he built was halted with a thud, concluding just a victory shy of the franchise record. Washington took full advantage of the Pelicans' diminished star power, dispatching them 116-97 and sweeping the season series. \"Yeah, it hurts (not having <mark>Davis</mark>),\" Jrue Holiday said. \"But, we have a team full of people who step up to the plate. Tonight, it didn't happen very much. We saw some guys play well, but we just can't always rely on <mark>Anthony</mark>.\" It was the Pelicans' first loss since Feb. 9, and in the month between defeats New Orleans climbed from No. 8 to the coveted No. 4 spot in the bunched up Western Conference standings. While the loss didn't immediately drop the Pelicans from that valuable home-court advantage perch, it did tighten the margin for error down to a half-game. And it underscored the notion that if <mark>Davis</mark> remains out for any length of time, the Pelicans could be more concerned with reaching the playoffs at all than where it's seeded. Without <mark>Davis</mark>, the Pelicans' offense had nowhere to turn when it needed a bucket to stop a run and no one to seal off the paint from a torrent of Wizards dribble drives. Instead, E\u2019Twaun Moore was forced to cover the rangy 6-foot-8 Otto Porter, Jr., who tallied 19 points. And Markieff Morris battered the Pelicans' interior for 17 of his own. In short, the Pelicans had no answers. Their cheat sheet was sitting on the bench in a sweatsuit. Once Washington rattled off a 27-7 run midway through the second quarter, there was little drama remaining for the sold out crowd of 18,147 fans, most of whom headed to the exits with more than six minutes remaining. However, coach Alvin Gentry is hopeful the Pelicans' won't miss <mark>Davis</mark> for long, claiming the All-Star can potentially return for Sunday's 3 p.m. tipoff against the Utah Jazz. \"I don't think it's that big of a deal,\" Gentry said, when asked about the severity of <mark>Davis</mark>' injury. \"I really don't. It's a sprained ankle and it's going to be OK. I'm optimistic about Sunday, yes .\" Friday, however, went off the rails in a hurry. After tallying at least 110 points in each of the 10 consecutive wins, New Orleans couldn't gear up into its fast pace or create their typical shooting space, scoring just 19 in each of the first two quarters. And the premium placed on ball security during the winning streak evaporated under a torrent of sloppy passes. The Pelicans finished the third quarter with an equal number of assists and turnovers (14). \"We just never got into any kind of flow,\" Gentry said. One game after Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic carried the Pelicans' fourth quarter in a win at Sacramento, they were nowhere to be found. Washington swarmed Holiday and Mirotic, running them off of the arc and shading defenses their way whenever some open space appeared. With all of the focus on him, Holiday not only failed to replace some of <mark>Davis</mark>' production but didn't come close to replicating his own. \"It was just one of them games for me,\" Holiday said. \"I just didn't really have it. I'm a little disappointed in myself .\" After a torrid run of averaging more than 25 points per game, Holiday failed to fight off the array of double teams thrown at him and tallied just just four points and two assists, his lowest output since the season opener. \"I mean, it's not easy for him,\" Mirotic said of Holiday. \"All of the games, he's guarding the best player there and we're kind of expecting him to be a leader of the offense too. So I think he might be a little tired today, too, which is normal. And he's guarding (All-Star Bradley) Beal tonight, so it was really a tough matchup .\" It just wasn't our day. \"This article originally ran on theadvocate.com.

Minister of Local Government and Community Development, Hon. Desmond McKenzie, is calling on local authorities to become more self-sufficient, in order to reduce their dependency on central government. He was addressing the opening ceremony of the inaugural Caribbean Conference of Mayors at the University of the West Indies (UWI) Regional Headquarters, Mona, St. Andrew, today (April 9). \"If we speak about the independence of local government, then we should create our own niche of revenue, and it's time we extricate ourselves from the pockets of central government by becoming more relevant when it comes to generating our own sources of revenue,\" the Minister said. Mr. McKenzie emphasised that the potential is there for this to become a reality, noting that \"this is one area of disappointment in local government\". The Minister argued that the success of central government requires the continued success of local government. \"Local government has and continues to be the most accessible and intimate form of government to the citizens anywhere, (and) its importance continues to grow. As our collective economy and societies evolve, we should pool our intellectual and social capacities to drive and support development in our cities, municipalities and countries,\" he said. The Minister said the conference provides an opportunity for local government practitioners to share best practices and significantly improve the quality of service provided to citizens, particularly in starting the process of coordinating the creation of smart cities across the Caribbean. \"The starting point of this process is the sharing of ideas--communication and information technologies--to increase efficiency and creativity of our operations. In this way, we will positively affect service delivery and governance in our cities and municipalities, and, at the same time, we will more strongly contribute to the share of the limited budget resources that are available to the local authorities,\" he said. The conference, which ends on April 11, is being held under the theme \"Caribbean Cities: Honouring the Past, Embracing a Smart Future'. It is geared towards building relationships and understanding among mayors and local government practitioners from across the Caribbean.

Get a jump on that rapidly evolving trend at Big Data Expo, which we are introducing in November at Cloud Expo Silicon Valley. \"Cloud\" has become synonymous with \"computing\" and \"software\" in two short years. Cloud Expo is the new PC Expo, Comdex, and InternetWorld of our decade. By 2012, more than 50,000 delegates per year will participate in Cloud Expo worldwide. The cloud is certainly a compelling alternative to running all applications within a traditional corporate data center. But moving from theory into practice is where things get complicated, and this is where attending a top industry event like Cloud Expo comes in. No one can take full advantage of cloud computing without first becoming familiar with the latest issues and trends, which is why the organizing principle of the 10th International Cloud Expo on November 4-7, 2013 - is to ensure - through an intensive four-day schedule of keynotes, general and breakout sessions, and our bustling Expo Floor - that attending delegates leave the Santa Clara Convention Center with abundant resources, ideas and examples they can apply immediately to leveraging the Cloud, helping them to maximize performance, minimize cost and improve the scalability of their Enterprise IT endeavors. Delegates will leave Cloud Expo with dramatically increased understanding the entire scope of the entire cloud computing spectrum from storage to security. Whether you're an enterprise or small to medium business, you'll soon be benefiting from the Cloud. Join your peers in Silicon Valley November 4-7, and maximize those benefits already in 2013.

Harris and Shahien Nasiripour, Bloomberg News WASHINGTON--Maryland and Washington, D.C., officials unleashed a burst of subpoenas seeking financial records that would penetrate <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s closely guarded trust and business and reveal whether the president is profiting off foreign governments. Among the investigative demands issued Tuesday to more than 30 business entities, competitors and government agencies is a request for state and federal tax returns of Trump's personal trust and the Trump Organization. The officials are seeking information about spending by foreign and domestic governments at Trump's D.C. hotel as part of a lawsuit accusing the president of enriching himself through the White House. Unless the specific requests are blocked by a court, the records could allow attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia to pierce a layer of secrecy that Trump and his company have zealously guarded--namely, which governments the company is pitching for business and how much revenue Trump has generated from overseas officials while in public office. The subpoenas, many of which the attorneys general publicly disclosed, come a day after a federal judge approved a schedule for the two sides to exchange documents as part of the attorneys general's lawsuit. The suits claim Trump's ownership of the luxury hotel violates the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clauses because visiting government officials may be spending money there to curry favor with the president. Along with the Trump Organization, the attorneys general seek documents from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, Trump International Hotels Management LLC and related entities. The officials also want records from the hotel's competitors and the U.S. departments of Defense, Commerce and the Treasury, as well as the state of Maine. The case is among a number of legal and political challenges to Trump's ownership of a sprawling empire, spurring criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that Trump is seeking to profit off the presidency. In winning the court's approval to delve into Trump's records, the D.C. and Maryland attorneys general are now entering a realm of the president's life he once declared off-limits to those probing him. But that hasn't stopped investigators. Last week, special counsel Robert Mueller won a guilty plea from Trump's longtime personal lawyer, <mark>Michael Cohen</mark>, who told a judge that the then-candidate secretly sought to develop a Moscow Trump Tower until well after the 2016 Iowa primary. And last month New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood won a court ruling allowing the state to move forward with a lawsuit accusing the president and his three oldest children of engaging in a decadelong pattern of self-dealing and using his nonprofit's funds for political purposes. Trump and his children have denied the allegations. The attorneys general lawsuit is taking a different tack, searching for proof that Trump's luxury hotel--just blocks from the White House--is enriching him in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit names just Trump as a defendant. But included among the many targets of the broad subpoenas are documents related to the flow of money from the hotel to the president's pocket, the extent of foreign and domestic government business at his hotel, and steps taken to attract their dollars. In addition to the tax returns, the attorneys general are seeking organizational charts, communications between the U.S. government and Trump companies, a list of hotel guests and restaurant customers employed by foreign or domestic governments, and insight into how the company calculated a $151,470 payment to the U.S. Treasury, ostensibly from foreign sources. \"On Feb. 22, 2018, the Trump Organization voluntarily donated to the U.S. Treasury all profits identified as being from foreign government patronage at our hotels and similar businesses,\" company spokeswoman <mark>Amanda Miller</mark> said. \"We intend to make a similar contribution in 2019 .\" The attorneys general also want records about \"the anticipated and actual impact of the 2016 presidential election\" on the hotel's finances, according to the subpoenas. The attorneys general will review competing hotels, restaurants and event spaces in Maryland and the District for evidence they're losing customers to the president. Some foreign governments have been open about spending money at Trump's Pennsylvania Avenue hotel. The Philippines hosted an event at the hotel in June to mark the 120th anniversary of its independence. Lobbyists representing Saudi Arabia spent some $270,000 at the hotel last year as part of an effort to derail terrorism legislation, according to filings with the U.S. Justice Department. Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has requested information from the embassies of Kuwait, Bahrain and Azerbaijan regarding events they've held at Trump's hotel since his 2016 election. Justice Department lawyers last week told U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte that they'll seek permission from an appeals court in Richmond, Va., to appeal and to freeze the evidence-gathering process while that review plays out .---- --"}]
