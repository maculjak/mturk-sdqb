(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) More WASHINGTON (AP)--Not since John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Bobby to be attorney general and his brother-in-law as director of the Peace Corps has a president leaned so heavily on his family. Even <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s 5-year-old granddaughter Arabella has pitched in. As the administration nears its 100-day mark, Trump has established a White House operation with such an unusual commingling of blood, business and government that it has surprised even his own family. Ivanka Trump, who once said she'd stick to the role of daughter, now has a West Wing office and the title of assistant to the president after she discovered that \"having one foot in and one foot out wouldn't work .\" Her effort to walk a fine line has not always been easy. During an appearance Tuesday at a women's empowerment conference in Germany, she drew hisses and groans as she defended her father's track record. Her husband Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to the president with a bulging and growing portfolio that includes everything from brokering Mideast peace to restructuring the federal government. And there was the president's son Eric, in the unofficial role of spokesman, declaring his father would stand up to North Korea's provocations. In an interview, at the White House Easter egg roll no less, saying on behalf of the president: \"You don't want there to be death and destruction and turmoil around the world but, again, you have to have massive backbone when it comes to dealing with awful, awful dictators .\" Another Trump son, Don Jr., enhanced his profile during the campaign and early months of his father's presidency to such an extent that there is speculation he'll make his own run for office. And he's leaving that door open, saying the New York governor's seat could be a tempting destination at some point. The president's wife, Melania, meanwhile, has been a largely distant presence so far, remaining in New York for the most part while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes out the school year. But she is gradually spending more time in Washington and did give her husband a gentle nudge to put his hand on his heart during the playing of the national anthem at the Easter egg roll. Little Arabella chimed in to the Trump team effort by charming Chinese President Xi Jinping by singing a tune in Mandarin during the leaders' recent meeting at Mar-a-Lago. There are both pros and cons in staffing up from within one's own family, as Trump is learning. The family dynamic has added extra intrigue to the jockeying between rival power centers that is typical in the early days of any White House. The more moderate contingent led by Kushner and Ivanka Trump appears to be ascendant in recent days over those allied with senior strategist Steve Bannon, the former media executive and radio host who's a favorite of conservatives. Princeton historian Julian Zelizer says family members may be able to give a president a tough assessment that other staff members would shrink from providing, but they also can become \"so enmeshed in the identity of their family and protecting their father that they can't give honest advice or can't even see problems as they emerge .\" Ivanka Trump has been criticized for not speaking out more forcefully when she disagrees with her father. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's not making her views heard. \"I would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,\" she said earlier this month. During her appearance this week in Berlin, she said she's still \"rather unfamiliar\" with her new role as first daughter and presidential adviser but hopes to bring advice and feedback \"back to both my father and the president--and hopefully that will bring about incremental, positive change .\" Her husband, meanwhile, has traveled to Iraq with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and has been advising the president on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. The extent of Ivanka Trump's sway with her father is suggested by Eric Trump's recent comment that she likely weighed in before the president decided to bomb Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. Eric Trump told London's Daily Telegraph: \"She has influence. I'm sure she said,\" Listen, this is horrible stuff .' \"The blurry line between the Trump family's business interests and its government connections is another unusual complication of this presidency. Even with sons Don Jr. and Eric tasked with running the Trump businesses while Kushner and Ivanka Trump tend to government affairs, the continuing public-private overlap has generated lots of questions about conflicts of interest. Read More The separation between business and government is\" totally artificial, \"says Zelizer. Eric Trump's admission to Forbes magazine in February that\" nepotism is kind of a factor of life \"in the Trump family didn't help dispel the impression of an insider's clan, although he stressed that\" if we didn't do a good job, if we weren't competent, believe me, we wouldn't be in this spot. \"For all the questions about Trump's reliance on family, some see it as a net positive. The value of having a son or daughter on the inside\" is honesty and love, \"says former George H.W. Bush administration staffer Doug Wead, author of books on presidential children and the 2016 campaign .\" They care if your shirt-tail is hanging out. If your hair is messed up, they'll tell you. When everybody else is trying to hide from you, they're going to let you know. \"The power--and peril--of Kushner's place in Trump World is hinted at by Washington graybeard Henry Kissinger in a write-up for Time's list of 100 most influential people. Kissinger said Kushner's broad education and business background\" should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun. \"___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http: //twitter.com/nbenac"}, {"articleID": "2014112018_00001021_W", "names": {"King Kong": ["Q2171232", "Q22278621", "Q6411824"]}, "date": "2014-11-20", "url": "http://www.modernghana.com/news/582121/1/stephen-akwetey-to-invest-gh1-million-into-health-.html", "content": "The Former Greater Accra Regional Chairman Aspirant of the National Democratic Congress NDC, Stephen Akwetey has reiterated commitment to invest in the ongoing project he outlines, as part of the promises he made towards the campaign.

Government dietary guidelines encouraged the consumption of poultry as a healthier alternative.

No longer does Vass have the comfort of <mark>Dylan Thomas</mark>, Bryan Joyve or Kevin Haggerty on his side. Instead, its him and a wealth of new players tasked with leading the Pioneers into a new form of glory, Central Jersey, Group 2. New Providence head coach Art Cattano said with all the work Vass put in during the summer, he is more than capable of stepping up as a leader on and off the floor. Sign Up for E-News \"He's got to be on the court as much as possible, if not all the time,\" Cattano said, \"just because of the fact that he's a very good point guard and can run the show. He just makes everybody else better when he's in there. I'd say there is a lot on him .\" Vass will be tasked with being every bit of a leader that <mark>Thomas</mark>, Haggerty and the rest of last year's senior class were combined. However, he won't be doing it alone. Joining Vass is senior football standout <mark>Russell Davidson</mark>, who could be the Pioneers' biggest surprise. The all-conference defensive lineman is relatively new to basketball, but because of his work ethic and natural leadership abilities, has stepped up to be a major part of Cattano's plan. \"Here is a kid with not a lot of basketball experience, but football wise, his presence, he's just that type of kid,\" Cattano said. \"He's developed that from being a captain on the football team. He really works hard. I'm very pleased with him. I didn't know what to expect from him. He's into basketball and he really likes it. He's certainly a big help .\" Sophomore Jack Barletta has also propelled himself into the starting lineup. His pure athleticism doesn't go unnoticed, as both Cattano and Vass expressed their desire to see Barletta exceed on the hardwood. \"He's just really athletic,\" Vass said. \"He's fast and can get to the rim. He's going to be a good player .\" The biggest question facing the Pioneers this year is who else will step up until Sean Cole returns later in the season. Jason DiBenedetto and Jon Munroe are both expected to see significant playing time this year, however after that, the rest is a big question mark. \"I'm looking forward to see who steps up on the team,\" Vass said. \"Its going to be a whole new team this year with the exception of me. I want to know who can step up and fill the roles of players from last year .\" The Pioneers tip-off their season on Friday night, and right off the bat will be forced into highly competitive games against rivals Oratory Prep and Jonathan Dayton before making their annual appearance in the Chatham Cougar Classic. With a jump up to Central Jersey, Group 2 for states, Cattano is hoping that New Providence's early season strength of schedule will give his squad enough experience to get ready for a strong push in January, February and March. \"We play some pretty good schools in our season,\" Cattano said. \"Forget about our league, we play Summit, Caldwell, Chatham, Hanover Park. We play Summit, Hanover Park and Chatham just in the holiday tournament. Its brutal, but its good for us. Its very good competition .\" Tip-off for Friday's season opener at Oratory Prep is scheduled for 7 p.m."}, {"articleID": "2015031218_00007123_W", "names": {"Joseph Sanchez": ["Q11728477", "Q6286816"], "Larry Walker": ["Q11752886", "Q22337579", "Q3218116"], "Chris Drury": ["Q2495654", "Q471491"], "Matt Miller": ["Q16732613", "Q20680269", "Q32945388", "Q6788873", "Q6789069", "Q6789071", "Q6789072", "Q6789073", "Q6789074", "Q6789075"]}, "date": "2015-03-12", "url": "http://www.heyreverb.com/blog/2015/03/12/remember-remember-garth-brooks-was-in-denver/101377/", "content": "In this Jan. 25, 2008 file photo, country singer Garth Brooks performs during a charity concert in Los Angeles, to benefit the Southern California 2008 Fire Intervention Relief Effort (F.I.R. E). Brooks is going to be very busy in December. Brooks sold more than 140,000 tickets Saturday morning, Nov. 6, 2010, and his benefit concert for Nashville, Tenn., flood relief ballooned from one show to nine. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) Garth Brooks took the stage with a beeper clipped to his belt. It was the year 1996 and Brooks and his then-wife Sandy Mahl were expecting their third child. Mahl was due any moment, her contractions were four minutes apart that day and the beeper was there to notify Brooks if his third child was coming. \"If this beeper goes off, I'm out of here,\" Brooks said before the show at McNichols Arena - his first of three-night sold out run. \"I've got a plane here ready to go .\" Lucky for Denver fans, Brooks' daughter (Allie Colleen Brooks) was born a week later and the country star made it through his string of McNichols shows. When Brooks returns on March 18 for his first Colorado concert since the McNichols run, Allie Brooks will be nearing her 18th birthday. Babies have become adults, the McNichols building has been demolished, Brooks has retired, returned from retirement and has released three more albums in the time it took him to make his way back to play a proper show in Colorado. That Colorado fans have waited nearly two decades to see the country superstar was only half the excitement when he announced his return in January. Brooks will be playing nine shows at Denver's Pepsi Center from March 18-24. It's a record breaking tour stop in the region: with 120,000 tickets up for grabs, Brooks has sold more tickets than any artist with consecutive shows at one venue in Colorado. While he hasn't played a proper show since 1996, Brooks has made two appearances in the state for charity events in the past few years. April 24, 2010 - Brooks attends the opening of Child Life Zone The Garth Brooks Teammates for Kids Foundation and the Troy Aikman Foundation built the $2 million therapeutic and education play area at Denver Health Medical Center. Brooks himself appeared for the grand opening. \"Trust me, you're gonna be very happy what it does for our kids,\" country singer Brooks told a large and cheering audience made up of hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, support staff, children, parents, politicians and members of both Broncos and Avalanche teams. June 8, 2000 - Baseball in field boots: Brooks was one of the celebrities on the roster for the Evening of Stars and Fireworks, a celebrity softball game featuring members of the Rockies, the Rapids, the Broncos, the Avalanche and the Nuggets. As the Denver Post's <mark>Joseph Sanchez</mark> wrote of the evening: \"It was country music star Garth Brooks, in farmhand field boots, trying to tackle <mark>Larry Walker</mark> of the Colorado Rockies in the pregame introductions at home plate...For the record, <mark>Walker</mark>'s Blue Stars defeated Brooks' Gray Stars 27-26 when Jon Klemm of the Avs slapped a Griese pitch over the centerfield fence in the bottom of the sixth inning, scoring Avs teammate <mark>Chris Drury</mark> ahead of him .\" And what about previous shows before his lengthy absence in Colorado? June 2, 1992 - McNichols Arena: As the Denver Post described the scene of Brooks' Colorado tour just before the release of his fourth studio album, \"The Chase\" : \"With his now familiar headset microphone, Brooks paced the length of the stage like a caged panther, using the ramps to work the audience along the sides and back of the arena. He played little guitar, opting to shake hands and hug members of the audience like a politician. Three songs into the set Brooks told the screaming throng:\" Six and a half months off and it took me one second tonight to figure out that this is where I belong .' Sept. 6, 1993 - Pueblo State Fair: Brooks headlined the Pueblo State Fair in 1993, where he accepted a rain of flowers from the fans. He even made a special request for crews to work non-stop to build a stage lower to the ground and closer to the crowd. \"It paid off,\" The Denver Post wrote. Google +. Or send us a telegram.
