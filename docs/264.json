With temperatures set to soar up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), and as refugees continue to flee to Jordan and Lebanon, \"the health risks must be urgently addressed,\" Oxfam said in a statement. \"Increased cases of public health-related diseases such as diarrhoea and skin infections have already been recorded in host communities and temporary settlements where an increasing number of refugees now live,\" it added. Oxfam said it is \"crucial to ensure funds are in place to provide refugees with shelter, clean water and adequate sanitation,\" adding that it is aiming to raise $53.4 million (41.6 million euros) over the next year. So far Oxfam's appeal is only 23 percent funded, the statement said. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has said the number of refugees in Jordan alone could reach 1.2 million by the end of the year--equivalent to one fifth of the kingdom's population. The kingdom says it currently hosts more than 500,000 Syrian refugees. Lebanon currently houses 400,000 Syrians, according to the United Nations. \"Providing safe water, appropriate sanitation facilities and access to health care is costly. It's time for the key donors to wake up and face that reality,\" said Rick Bauer, regional humanitarian coordinator of Oxfam. \"The sad reality is that the vast majority of Syrian refugees are not going home soon. It is also crystal clear that host communities in Lebanon and Jordan need urgent help.\" Bauer said Oxfam is \"starting to really worry about the health of Syrian refugees\" . \"The aid effort must be properly funded and focused on providing refugees with affordable and decent places to stay, where they can live with dignity. That's priority number one for refugees and host communities alike,\" he said.

Business groups in Blenheim are in talks over a business hub. Photo: LDR / Chloe Ranford A report detailing the pros and cons of a business hub has been released by four of the region's business groups and the Marlborough District Council - who have christened themselves \"Marlborough Inc'. The idea was first pitched during last year's annual plan, when the Marlborough Chamber of Commerce asked the council to fund a feasibility study into a business hub. The council instead offered to run meet-ups to pinpoint how to better support local businesses. It had since held three meetings with Destination Marlborough, Marlborough Chamber of Commerce, Business Trust Marlborough and the Blenheim Business Association (BBA), the report said. Council strategic planning and economic development manager <mark>Neil Henry</mark> said the organisations had supported an investigation into possible business hub costs, and creating a more\" cohesive \"business model. But their report showed the organisations were concerned that setting up a hub would cause a loss of brand identity and independence,\" community confusion \", and difficulties over who owned the building and its data. Written under the\" cons' section were people's worries, including: \"[the] bad performance of one partner effecting all\" , \"[being] tarred with the same brush\" and \"dominant personalities winning out\" . Business Trust Marlborough also queried the potential cost of renting a space in the hub, as their current lease was $285 a month. Benefits of a business hub included reductions in duplication, a potential reduction in costs, and a \"vibrant work environment\" . \"[It could allow] cover while I am on holiday,\" one person wrote. Marlborough Chamber of Commerce CEO Hans Neilson pitched the idea of a business hub to the Marlborough District Council last year. Photo: LDR / Chloe Ranford <mark>Henry</mark> said a hub would also prove Marlborough was \"open for business', and could entice central government agencies to set up. The organisations noted under an\" insights' prompt that the business hub might need to be located outside Blenheim's town centre, and that moving in together could encourage a lower infrastructure footprint. <mark>Henry</mark> pointed out that a business hub was not needed to build a more cohesive business system, which the organisations were working on. The proposed system, which could be put down instead of or before a business hub's establishment, encouraged the organisations to discuss each other's services to clients and share reporting. Business Trust Marlborough manager and councillor <mark>Brian Dawson</mark>, who could not vote on the report due to conflict of interest, said to keep or scrap the business hub was a \"big decision\" . He went with Marlborough Chamber of Commerce chief executive Hans Neilson to Hawkes Bay in September last year to pilfer ideas from its business hub, which covered a region, like Marlborough. \"Like all things, there's advantages and disadvantages,\" he said. Hawkes Bay's business hub was \"no doubt\" the go-to place for businesses, but there was also \"an air of very stiff competition\" . \"This is fine for bigger corporations, but the smallers ones have to constantly carve out a space in a client's mind,\" <mark>Dawson</mark> said. \"All events have multiple organisations attached to them. Sponsors don't know whether to sponsor one organisation or all of them.\" <mark>Henry</mark> said the organisations would decide whether to submit a funding request to the council's 2020-21 annual plan in April, and would consider opening the meetings to others in future. Until then, they aimed to complete several \"quick wins', like streamlining event calendars to\" remove duplication \", and publishing each other's business pitch to their personal websites to\" helped present a united \"Marlborough Inc' face\" , he said in his report. The organisations would continue to meet monthly to \"improve collaboration\" .

In May's elections, nationalist and populist formations such as France's National Front and Britain's UK Independence Party made strong advances. And while two-thirds of the assembly is still made up of the mainstream center-right and center-left, Francis must offer a message that resonates with an audience ranging from devout Christians to militant atheists. \"The pope will be warmly welcomed--both as a religious leader and as a moral authority,\" said Jan Bernas, spokesman for the Socialist-Democrat group, which holds the second-most seats in the 751-seat Parliament. \"As a secular political organization, we embrace various orientations and don't follow any religious doctrine,\" Bernas told NCR. \"But we believe charity and the common good should be at the heart of politics, and we'll be eager to hear his words of encouragement.\" Become one today! Francis will also be visiting the nearby Council of Europe, the wider advisory organization of European states, whose 47 members include Russia and Ukraine. German Cardinal <mark>Reinhard Marx</mark>, who heads the Commission of European Union Bishops Conferences (COMECE) said he hopes Francis will plead against the war now setting Russia and Ukraine against each other. But he said he's confident Francis will also address the poverty and exclusion that have worsened during the financial crisis and reiterate Catholic support for the \"noble ideals of European integration.\" \"Pope Francis is acknowledging the unique significance of the European institutions in the life of our continent and saluting the achievements of the European project,\" <mark>Marx</mark>, archbishop of Munich-Freising, said in a mid-September statement. \"We hope he'll encourage European parliamentarians in their work and show how the foundational values of the Union, largely inspired by the Christian faith, may shape the Europe of tomorrow,\" <mark>Marx</mark> said. Not everyone has been so positive. There have been calls for a boycott of the visit by politicians favoring the French model of strict church-state separation, as well as from a coterie of secularist and anti-clerical organizations. Members of the feminist group Femen protested the pope's intended \"attack on secularization\" in a naked St. Peter's Square protest in mid-November, while The Alliance for a Secular Europe rejected Schulz's invitation, citing the Catholic church's alleged compounding of the Ebola pandemic in West Africa. \"The religious movement represented by the Pope continues to actively combat human rights, such as the European Union defends, seeking to impose on the rest of society a dogmatic moral vision, in defiance of the principles of freedom of conscience and equality,\" The Alliance for a Secular Europe wrote in an Oct. 31 open letter. \"The Catholic Church's doctrinal positions on start and end of life and sexual matters, including women's reproductive rights, the very issues on which they campaign most forcefully, are the very ones on which they are at most variance from their followers, especially in Europe,\" the letter continued. Schulz has sought to reassure the critics. \"We'll be welcoming someone who, at this historical moment, is a point of reference not only for Catholics but for many other people as well,\" Schulz said at a mid-October Strasbourg press conference. \"At a time when many are disorientated and the world is moving at a dizzying speed, often in very risky directions, the pope is the only person giving people hope through his noble rectitude,\" he said. It remains to be seen, however, how Francis will be received. \"The Holy Father's presence is symbolic--but he'll be speaking in front of European representatives who are responsible for democracy, freedom of religion and human rights, and he'll clearly be viewed differently than his predecessors,\" Marion Jeanne, a French spokesman for the conservative European People's Party, told NCR. \"Although his visit will strongly signal recognition for the EU as a peace project, however, I'm not only expecting words of peace. I also imagine he'll want to wake Europe up to its Christian roots and our global responsibility to keep them alive.\" The visit, which will last barely four hours, will be the pope's first to the territory of the European Union outside Italy and the first to the European Parliament by a pontiff since that of Pope <mark>John Paul</mark> II in 1988. <mark>John Paul</mark>'s address to the Parliament was disrupted by the Rev. <mark>Ian Paisley</mark>, leader of Northern Ireland's Protestants, who was bundled from the chamber after waving posters branding the pontiff the \"anti-Christ.\" But the pope was otherwise well-received for his speech, defending the \"aspirations of Slavic peoples\" then under Communist rule, and for championing a united \"sovereign Europe, shaped by the Christian faith.\" Much has changed since in Europe's political and cultural map. The 1989 collapse of Communist rule brought old nations back into the European family. Meanwhile, the EU has expanded from 12 to 28 member-states with a combined population of 507 million and wields far greater power and influence as the world's largest economic bloc. Although the Vatican appointed its own permanent representative to the European institutions in 1990 and has consistently argued for an integrated Europe, it's often been unhappy with the course of events. Church membership and participation plummeted, and EU officials have been accused of ignoring the role of religious communities in their treaties and directives. Prominent Catholics, meanwhile, have accused the European Parliament itself of an anti-Catholic agenda on issues like same-sex unions and embryo research. Others, however, have cautioned against overreacting. Although the EU's landmark 2009 Lisbon Treaty declined to acknowledge Europe's Christian roots directly, it recognized the \"identity and specific contribution\" of churches under the national law of member-states and committed EU officials, under Article 17, to maintain \"an open, transparent and regular dialogue\" with them. During the same year, church leaders expressed concern when MEPs, members of the European Parliament, voted to strip away national exemptions from the Anti-Discrimination Directive, raising fears that faith schools would be forced to admit non-believers and gay couples would be able to sue if refused church marriages. In 2011, however, they welcomed a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights validating the public presence of crosses after a previous judgment barring them from state schools had prompted calls for a Europe-wide ban. In 2013, church leaders accused the Parliament of trespassing beyond its competence after a draft resolution called for abortion--which is tightly restricted in Poland, Malta, and other countries--to be recognized as a \"fundamental right\" throughout the EU. In June 2013, however, they lauded the Parliament's backing for new EU plans to make financial help for countries around the world conditional on their protection of religious rights. Such topics may well appear in the pope's Strasbourg address. Although Francis has said little so far about Europe, he'll most likely be aware, as an experienced Jesuit pastor, of the challenges of secularization and the need for change in how his church proclaims the Gospel in an area deeply affected by hardship and social injustice and showing signs of tiredness and disillusionment. Speaking in Sardinia, Italy, in September 2013, Francis talked of an economic system that had fueled a crisis both cultural and economic and the need to place mankind at its center again in place of the \"would-be pagan god of money.\" It may be a message the pontiff brings to talks with new European officials such as Poland's Donald Tusk, who takes over Dec. 1 as president of the European Council, or the EU's head of state, and Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who took over on Nov. 1 as 12th president of the EU's 28-member governing commission. As his largest encounter with politicians to date, the Strasbourg visit will bring Francis into contact with all the political and ideological tendencies of a continent marked through history by wars and crises. But Fr. Patrick Daly, secretary-general of COMECE, is hopeful. Francis cannot assume a \"familiarity with Christian social teaching\" on the part of his audience, Daly said, but he can be expected to cope well with \"his first test in the political arena.\" \"President Schulz and the MEPs have a right to assume the pope will display sensitivity to the long-term aspirations of the European project, and to the competences and policy fields specific to the Union,\" Daly said in an October statement. \"But the Holy Father will be speaking to a Parliament that still has the freshness and energy of any parliament at the beginning of its term, knowing that 58 percent of MEPs are there for the first time, and are impressionable,\" he said.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Sen. John Cornyn is on the short list to be the next FBI director Some of his Republican Senate colleagues want someone else (CNN) Influential Senate Republicans are questioning whether one of their own--Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn--should be tapped to run the FBI, amid a deeply chaotic political environment after President Donald Trump fired James Comey as director of the bureau. While Cornyn is one of the more popular members of the Senate GOP Conference, a number of his colleagues are skeptical that he would be the right choice for the job, worried that such a pick would be viewed as too political at a time when many critics are questioning whether Comey was fired to slow-walk the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian coordination with the Trump campaign during last year's elections. On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to put his weight behind his top deputy, instead pushing another potential candidate, Merrick Garland, who was former President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick before the majority leader led an effort to scuttle his nomination last year. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate judiciary committee with Cornyn, suggested that it made sense to name an FBI agent to the post--rather than the Texas Republican. And on Monday, Sen. <mark>Susan Collins</mark>, who sits on the intelligence committee with Cornyn, said it made sense to choose either Garland or <mark>Mike Rogers</mark>, a former House intelligence committee chairman and FBI special agent. \"I think the world of John Cornyn, and he would be a great choice in normal times, but we're not living in normal times,\" Sen. <mark>Susan Collins</mark>, a Maine Republican, told CNN Monday. Read More With Garland, <mark>Collins</mark> said: \"No one could argue that he was beholden to anybody in any way and he would bring integrity and independence to the job.\" On Monday, Cornyn, who has insisted he has not been offered the job, told CNN he interviewed this weekend for 45 minutes with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his former Senate colleagues, and Rod Rosenstein, who is the deputy attorney general. But Cornyn declined to say whether the Russia probe or Comey's firing were discussed. And he would not say if there was a pledge for loyalty, as Trump reportedly asked Comey to commit to earlier this year, though the White House has denied that account. \"I met with the attorney and the deputy attorney general. I told him I was interested in having a conversation and, basically, that's what we did,\" Cornyn said. Asked about the White House's shifting explanations for Comey's firing, Cornyn said he still backed the President's decision and supported the initial reasoning behind the firing--that Comey mishandled the Clinton email investigation. \"I found the Rod Rosenstein email compelling--that's still my view.\" Cornyn would not comment about Trump's threats to release a tape of his conversations with Comey--or if Congress should obtain those tapes. But <mark>Collins</mark>, like other Republicans, said the White House should be prepared to turn them over. \"We have no idea whether or not there are tapes but if there are tapes then they should be turned over,\" <mark>Collins</mark> said. \"That issue was settled many years ago when the Supreme Court ruled in 1974 that the tapes that President (Richard) Nixon had should be turned over to Congress.\" Democrats have vowed to try to block the new FBI director until Rosenstein names a special prosecutor to investigate the Russia probe. But they would need to court at least three Republicans to be successful. And <mark>Collins</mark> signaled she would not go that route. \"I don't think that's a good strategy at all,\" <mark>Collins</mark> said, adding that she wanted to question Rosenstein Thursday on whether a special prosecutor was indeed needed."}, {"articleID": "2017082103_00635726_W", "names": {"Brad Pitt": ["Q35332", "Q373912"]}, "date": "2017-08-21", "url": "http://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/08/21/12/49/daniel-kelsall-argues-murder-sentence-should-be-reduced-by-up-to-10-years", "content": "Killer who stabbed victim 28 times in \"senseless' murder appeals sentence By Kelly Fedor \u2022 Court Reporter 1:40 pm Aug 21, 2017 Daniel Jack Kelsall today argued for his sentence to be reduced.

there is no heroism in brutally attacking peace convoys to break the siege around gaza. there is no heroism in attacking peaceful demonstrations against the wall and against the expansion of colonial settlement. if israel is not confronted with punitive resolutions, israel's madness would keep going.\" by holding on to talmudic and torah myths, israel appears unable to achieve balance with violence committed on a daily basis brutalising palestinians economically, politically and culturally, igniting a huge fire that shall very soon drag the israelis into its heat. it is important to remember that israel will not be the first entity who would be committing suicide by the hand of her sons! email a friend emailing an article to friend is a simple way to share a news item. your friend will receive an email with your name and email address as well any personal message you choose to send. the information you provide on this page will not be used to send unsolicited emails. opec needs to present a united front organisation has to sort out internal rivalries and enhance investment to tackle western challenges to its influence"}, {"articleID": "2018011117_00194252_W", "names": {"Bill Smith": ["Q17017840", "Q20273869", "Q4020151", "Q4400961", "Q4910910", "Q4910914", "Q4910916", "Q4910919", "Q4910920", "Q4910921", "Q4910925", "Q4910927", "Q56274191", "Q621106", "Q862469"]}, "date": "2018-01-11", "url": "http://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/main-news/shipt-to-bring-groceries-from-heb-to-abilene-homes/910517139", "content": "Shipt to bring groceries from HEB to Abilene homes By: Erica Garner Posted: Jan 11, 2018 11:02 AM CST Updated: Jan 11, 2018 11:04 AM CST Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc..

Carrawburgh Fort in Northumberland is one of 16 along the 73 miles of Hadrian's Wall and has been handed over to the care of English Heritage by owner Jennifer Du Cane. The 1.4 hectare site, which sits between the cavalry fort at Chesters and the infantry outpost at Housesteads, would once have been the garrison of 500 soldiers defending the wall from tribes in the north. The fort's surviving structures, including the remains of its walls, lie beneath the turf and it has been investigated archaeologically less than other sites nearby, meaning it could hold undiscovered treasures. Carrawburgh's garrison on the edge of the Roman Empire was made up of soldiers from south-west France and later southern Belgium, and they built a nearby temple to their god Mithras. The site has been cared for by the Du Cane family since 1950. Jennifer Du Cane said: \"It has been a great privilege, but also a serious responsibility, to own Carrawburgh Roman Fort.\" The time has come to pass on this amazing site as a gift to the nation. \"Legal ownership of Carrawburgh has transferred to Historic England, the Government's heritage adviser, and it will be cared for by English Heritage. The site has been owned by the du Cane family (Justin Minns/English Heritage/PA) It will join the National Heritage Collection which are important historic sites, dating back to Stonehenge and as recent as a Cold War bunker outside York. The fort is the first acquisition for the National Heritage Collection since English Heritage became a charity in 2015. Kate Mavor, English Heritage's chief executive, said:\" This is a great start to the New Year, not only for English Heritage but for the nation who will get to enjoy this wonderfully evocative site on what was once the edge of the Roman Empire. \"We would like to thank Jennifer Du Cane for her generosity and look forward very much to welcoming the public to Carrawburgh.\" It is already open for visitors (Justin Minns/English Heritage/PA) <mark>Duncan Wilson</mark>, chief executive at Historic England, said: \"We are enormously grateful for this generous gift.\" Hadrian's Wall is one of England's most important historic sites and Carrawburgh makes a really valuable addition to our National Collection of historic properties. \"The fort represents a key part of the Roman frontier and is of outstanding archaeological significance.\" It has the potential to contribute significantly to our knowledge of the Roman Empire and to visitor enjoyment of the Wall. \"Carrawburgh Roman Fort is now open to the public and entrance is free. 0 comment"}]
