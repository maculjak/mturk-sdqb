Credit: Nike In the back corner of a clothing boutique in downtown Manhattan, past the bolts of denim hanging from the wall, eight tailors and one cutter are at work sewing custom jeans. Each will make just two or three pairs in a day. The shop, called 3x1 (three-by-one), has intrigued shoppers and industry insiders alike. It is known for experimenting with selvedge denim sourced from mills around the world and for playing with new designs. Fans include professional athletes such as Lebron James, <mark>Tony Parker</mark> and Victor Cruz, whose superhuman physiques are ill-served by off-the-rack denim. A fully bespoke 3x1 pair can run upward of $1,200, but there are other ways for a high-end label to gain exposure to new shoppers. On Friday, 3x1 and Nike Inc. are releasing three limited-edition selvedge denim shoe styles, putting the type of fabric on the Air Force 1 for the first time ever, after 1,500 iterations. The sneakers cost $130 and come in stonewash blue, raw indigo and black denim. It's an important moment for the small denim house. \"We've had so many Nike relationships over the years,\" said owner and denim industry veteran <mark>Scott Morrison</mark>. \"I hope that this will be the first of many things we get to do .\" Nike is under constant pressure to develop new styles, so it often collaborates with outside fashion houses and designers. Drops happen every few days in an eternal cycle of hype, long lines and sellouts. Nike delivered strong results globally last quarter, but had weak sales in North America due to a slow period at its U.S. retail partners. Using non-traditional materials is one way to stand out, but the new collaboration won't be the first denim sneaker. Adidas, Puma and Converse have all sold denim styles. Nike previously made denim skateboarding sneakers and Air Jordans in collaboration with Levi's. The relationship between Nike and 3x1 began, at least in part, like many New York relationships: thanks to forced proximity. The 3x1 store is right next door to NikeLab 21 Mercer, a high-concept shop that's frequented by celebrities and hosts regular sneaker drops. Nike Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker began visiting the neighboring shop in 2011, and <mark>Morrison</mark> often chats with Al Baik, senior creative director of men's footwear at Nike Sportswear. Baik wanted to put high-end denim on people's feet. \"It only made sense to leverage <mark>Scott</mark>'s passion and expertise to get us there,\" he said. Denim is enjoying a widespread resurgence at the moment, having mounted a comeback in the past two years after shoppers passed over the classic style in favor of leggings and yoga pants throughout the mid-2010s. <mark>Morrison</mark> was along for that whole ride: He's been in the denim business for decades, first with Paper Denim & Cloth, then Earnest Sewn, before going on to run Japanese denim company Evisu. At 3x1, the custom jeans are its standout product, but the bulk of its business is in wholesale. The label's regular jeans run for around $200 to $400 and can be found in luxury retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's and Net-a-Porter. <mark>Morrison</mark> hopes to open additional 3x1 stores in California and Europe. He declined to share revenue numbers, but said the business is now \"as close to I've ever seen to profitable .\" --Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Retail and E-commerce", "articleID": "2019052416_00032433_W", "names": {"Scott Morrison": ["Q1286476", "Q21285393", "Q7436904", "Q7436906", "Q7436908"], "Tony Parker": ["Q193108", "Q19588477", "Q52151028", "Q52899347"]}}, {"date": "2019-05-25", "url": "http://highschoolsports.nj.com/news/article/-4425574274652336114/county-champs-nottingham-ww-p-north-chase-sectional-track-and-field-titles-video/", "content": "County champs Nottingham, WW-P North chase sectional track and field titles (VIDEO) By Andrew Borders | For NJ Advance Media on May 24, 2019 9:05 PM Central Jersey, Group 2 and 3 Meet Results Nottingham and West Windsor-Plainsboro North claimed the Mercer County boys and girls track and field titles two weeks ago, and now that the NJSIAA postseason has begun, those two teams are aiming high. Nottingham got a win in the 100 from Dana Ridley in the 100 (10.50) and WW-P North got wins from Nadia Elhossieni in the shot put (38-4 3/4) and Aditi Parekh in the long jump (18-0 1/4) to stand fifth and second their respective Central Jersey, Group 3 meets at Jackson Liberty heading into Saturday's 9 a.m. resumption. With both the Central Jersey, Group 2 and 3 boys discus results outstanding from Friday, as well as the Group 3 triple jump, WW-P North's boys lead Central Jersey, Group 3 28.5-26 over host Jackson Liberty with Hopewell Valley third at 16 and Nottingham fifth at 14. Colts Neck's girls lead WW-P North 47-44 with Northern Burlington third at 39. In Group 2, Matawan's boys lead Rahway 48-34, and Rumson-Fair Haven's girls lead Matawan 47.5-47. Competitors who finish in the top six in their events will advance to next weekend's group meet at Central Regional. \"Outperforming seeds is helping us out,\" WW-P North coach Matthew Warren said. \"When we showed up today, I said just like, girls, go for it. So far, they have. The performances have been either, like I said, outperforming seeds or just overwhelmingly incredible PRs from, like, Aditi. Tomorrow, we have another day .\" Parekh's previous outdoor long jump best was 17-3 1/2 from the sectional meet two years ago. Ridley's time surpassed the section record of 10.62 in fully-automated time as well as the hand-timed marks of 10.6, but the wind level of 3.6 meters per second surpassed the standard of 2.0 meters per second for the record to stand. \"I didn't have a time (goal) because I knew it was going to be wind-aided, so I just was going for place,\" Ridley said. Nottingham was dealt a tough blow when sprinter Louis Akpadago's hamstring did not recover in time for the meet after an injury suffered at the Mercer County meet. \"We thought that he had enough time to recover, but obviously, he didn't, so he won't run again until the nationals now. That's a big, big hole, but we needed something, we needed a spark, and (Ridley) kind of gave us one,\" Nottingham coach <mark>Jon Adams</mark> said. \"Dana kind of came to the rescue. Really, he's been working hard. We needed Superman to step up, and he showed up. The kid is a warrior and he proved that he's one of the top sprinters, and that's great for him .\" Carteret's Stephon Kelley-Gordon surpassed his own sectional record distance of 46-9 in the triple jump, leaping 48-0 3/4 to win that event in Central Jersey, Group 2, but those results had the No Wind Instrument designation to measure the gusts on an afternoon that saw its share of them. All in Central Jersey, Group 3, Steinert's Terris Burton won the high jump in 53.73, Hopewell Valley's Sean Dolan won the 1600 in 4:22.59, and Northern Burlington had two wins, from Kaneisha Raymond in the 400 hurdles in 1:07.37 and from Nathina Wright in the javelin at 111-0. Among the performances of note at the meet from outside the capital region, Metuchen's Nina Suss, Caroline Schleif, Camille Lussier and Mary Malague won the 4x800 in 9:40.90 to break the Central Jersey, Group 2 meet record of 9:42.64 Matawan set two years ago. When the meet resumes on Saturday, Nottingham will be looking to move up a spot from the runner-up finish it had to WW-P North last year, and the Knights' will be aiming to jump four spots from their fifth-place finish in 2018. <mark>Adams</mark> feels confident about where the Northstars stand. \"We'll see what happens tomorrow when we run our wheelhouse events, the 110 hurdles, the 200, the 4x1 and the javelin,\" <mark>Adams</mark> said. \"We put ourselves in pretty good position .\" ", "articleID": "2019052501_00116662_W", "names": {"Jon Adams": ["Q29650168", "Q42392966"]}}, {"date": "2019-05-25", "url": "http://www.bromsgroveadvertiser.co.uk/news/national/17664618.tory-battle-intensifies-as-new-candidates-emerge/", "content": "Tory battle intensifies as new candidates emerge By Press Association 2019 Tory leadership front runner Boris Johnson (David Mirzoeff/PA) 0 comment The Tory leadership race has exploded into life, with Cabinet minister <mark>Rory Stewart</mark> launching an attack on Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock entering the contest. As the battle heated up, International Development Secretary Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> said he could not serve in a government led by Mr Johnson because of his stance on a possible no-deal exit from the EU. The comments came as Labour insisted it would force a Commons vote of no confidence in the new prime minister as soon as possible. As Tory tensions rose, Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a no-deal exit would be \"damaging and dishonest\". He said: \"I could not serve in a government whose policy was to push this country into a no-deal Brexit .\" I could not serve with Boris Johnson. \"I spoke to Boris, I suppose, about two weeks ago about this and I thought at the time he had assured me that he wouldn't push for a no-deal Brexit .\" So, we had a conversation about 20, 25 minutes and I left the room reassured by him that he wouldn't do this. \"But, it now seems that he is coming out for a no-deal Brexit .\" Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> said there was no majority in the Commons for no deal, stating: \"I think it would be a huge mistake. Damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest .\" Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, who has emerged as the bookies' favourite, stressed he would be prepared to back a no-deal departure to ensure the UK leaves the EU on October 31. Mr Hancock said he was running for leader because the party needed to look to the future and attract younger voters. He said he would take a different approach to try and get Commons support for a Brexit deal than the one <mark>Theresa May</mark> used. He said: \"She didn't start by levelling with people about the trade-offs .\" I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposal if you are straightforward in advance. \"Mr Hancock warned against an early election, saying:\" Some of my contenders <mark>may</mark> say that if they don't get their preferred option, whether it be no deal or something else, then they'll have a general election. \"I put it to you that would be a disaster for the country and it would risk Corbyn by Christmas .\" Asked if Labour would force a Commons no confidence vote in the new prime minister when they take office, shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> told the Today programme: \"Yes .\" Because we believe any incoming prime minister in these circumstance should go to the country anyway and seek a mandate. \"Mr <mark>McDonnell</mark> said that Labour needed to have a new\" conversation \"about the way forward on Brexit. International Trade Secretary <mark>Liam Fox</mark> has refused to rule himself out as a Tory leadership candidate. Asked if he would stand, Dr <mark>Fox</mark> told the BBC:\" Well, I don't think it's likely to happen, but, as you say, it's an unusual contest. \"Dr <mark>Fox</mark> said:\" It is best for us to leave with an agreement. \"But, I think that it is possible, and probably increasingly likely now, that we could leave without a deal because I think there's a limited patience from the European Union with Britain's constant delay .\" Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who has said she will not stand for the top job, told the BBC: \"I would be very concerned about somebody who is too enthusiastic about no deal .\" It is very important that whoever takes this on looks for a solution and tries to work to find where the majority of the House (of Commons) is. \"More than a dozen Tories are understood to be considering a bid, with Foreign Secretary <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> indicating he will be in the race and former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey putting herself forward\" as a future leader \". (PA Graphics) The new Tory leader looks set to take over as prime minister at the end of July after Mrs <mark>May</mark> finally laid out a timetable for her exit from Downing Street. The timetable for the contest will see nominations close in the week of June 10, with MPs involved in a series of votes to whittle down what is set to be a crowded field to a final two contenders. Tory party members will then decide who wins the run-off. Hosting a radio call-in on LBC, Ms McVey said:\" I'll put my hands up here, I better declare an interest straight away. I have put myself forward as a future leader. \"And Sir Graham Brady quit as the leader of the 1922 Committee--a position which gave him a significant role in the Prime Minister's departure--in order to consider a leadership bid. Environment Secretary Michael Gove--who stood in the 2016 leadership race and <mark>may</mark> consider another bid--said Mrs <mark>May</mark>\" deserves our respect and gratitude \". Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who had a\" frank \"discussion with Mrs <mark>May</mark> about her deal on Thursday, said\" nobody could have worked harder or had a greater sense of public duty \". Leading Eurosceptic <mark>Steve Baker</mark> said he is\" considering \"running. 0 comment", "articleID": "2019052508_00262293_W", "names": {"Jeremy Hunt": ["Q333533", "Q929730"], "John Mcdonnell": ["Q10379941", "Q47348016", "Q55196720", "Q6247660", "Q6247662", "Q6247664", "Q6247666", "Q694695"], "Liam Fox": ["Q16300641", "Q332374", "Q6539597"], "Rory Stewart": ["Q328892", "Q55363983"], "Steve Baker": ["Q10379857", "Q15973457", "Q1991602", "Q2346812", "Q260111", "Q6380444", "Q7611849", "Q7611850", "Q7611852", "Q9345785"], "Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"]}}, {"date": "2019-05-26", "url": "http://scores.nbcsports.msnbc.com/en-xl/asia/nepal/four-killed-seven-injured-in-three-explosions-in-nepali-capital-police/ar-AABWzwA?li=BBJGzsi", "content": "Portals Navigation Outlook.com Skype Microsoft Store Facebook Twitter Office OneDrive Receive your emails here See your recent emails Send a quick email Manage your calendar with easy access Sign in with any Microsoft account: Outlook, Hotmail, MSN, Live What is a Microsoft account?
