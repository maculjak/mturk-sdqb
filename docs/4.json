washington post staff writer sunday, november 16, 2008; 11:19 pm redskins notebook: calf injury sidelines springs for fourth straight game campbell and moss, however, have not experienced that type of success recently--and neither have the redskins. the duo failed to connect on a fourth-down pass, dallas took possession with 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining in the game and ran out the clock in a 14-10 victory in front of 90,830. \"this is an nfc east game,\" washington cornerback fred smoot said. \"they gutted it out at the end, and we didn't make they plays when it mattered. they threw a punch, we threw a punch; they threw the last punch, and it knocked us out .\" the cowboys took the lead with 10:36 left to play on quarterback tony romo's 25-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end martellus bennett, who beat rookie strong safety <mark>chris horton</mark> off the line of scrimmage and made a nifty catch in the end zone while absorbing a hit from free safety laron landry. romo, who returned to the lineup after missing three games because of a pinky injury, threw two interceptions in the first half but led the cowboys (6-4) as they rallied past the redskins (6-4) in a matchup of nfc east rivals. romo completed 19 of 27 passes for 198 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions, his return providing a boost for the cowboys in what their players described as a must-win game. the redskins have now dropped two in a row. campbell finished 22 of 34 with 162 yards and one touchdown and one interception. running back clinton portis, playing with a sprained left knee, ran for 68 yards on 15 carries. \"we're 6-4, a lot of teams are 6-4,\" portis said. \"it's gonna come down to the end .\" neither team could establish a consistent rhythm on offense in a scoreless third quarter. the redskins began the second half with a three-point lead and the ball. starting at their 13, the redskins ran 12 plays in advancing to the cowboys' 35-yard line. but on third down, with campbell looking for moss along the right sideline, dallas cornerback terence newman got between moss and the ball and came up with an interception. in the redskins' previous game--a 23-6 loss to the pittsburgh steelers on nov. 3--campbell threw his first interception of the season in the third quarter, ending washington's nfl-record streak of games without an interception at 12, spanning 379 consecutive pass attempts. the interception was campbell's first in 271 straight attempts, which established a team record. he was picked off by the steelers a second time on washington's final offensive play. romo threw two first-half interceptions as he struggled against the nfl's fourth-ranked defense. with the cowboys at washington's 27-yard line in the first quarter, recently acquired pro bowl cornerback deangelo hall, in coverage against owens, intercepted a poorly thrown pass by romo. at washington's 25-yard line in the second quarter, romo completed a short pass in the middle of the field to owens, but the ball popped out of owens's hands when <mark>carlos rogers</mark> delivered a big hit and weak-side linebacker grabbed it for his first career interception. portis impressed as the redskins scored the game's first touchdown in the first quarter on a short touchdown pass from campbell to sellers. dallas tied the score at 7 on barber's two-yard touchdown run with 1:06 left in the half. romo had 28 - and 25-yard completions to tight end jason witten and owens, respectively, on consecutive plays to help dallas drive 80 yards on seven plays in 3:40. and then dallas did a poor job on its kickoff return coverage, and cartwright seized produced a 58-yard kickoff return. five plays later, suisham kicked a 41-yard field goal. \"it was really good,\" zorn said of cartwright's timely return. \"that is our special teams. we just need more of that. we talked during the week about how all three phases needed to be a part of the win, if we were going to win .\" increased fan support, in part, might have aided the redskins in their fast start. after pittsburgh fans seemed to take over fedex--waving gold-and-black terrible towels from start to finish--during the steelers' victory in week 9, players expressed disappointment and frustration about the situation. in fact, steelers fans were so vocal that the redskins had to use a silent count at times because of the crowd noise. presumably in response to that display, radio station espn 980, an outlet washington owner daniel snyder purchased in june, gave away 50,000 \"rally rags\" emblazoned with the redskins' colors and logo. redskins supporters then did their part, waving the towels in an impressive showing before kickoff and at other key moments throughout the game. portis provided the night's first stirring moment, carrying the united states flag as he ran onto the field during pregame introductions. there was a buzz in stadium about two hours before game time as portis, under the supervision of larry hess, director rehabilitation, tested his knee on the field. for about 15 minutes, portis cut sharply, sprinted and ran through others drills in an effort to determine whether he could play. for someone who had not practiced all week because of a sprained medial collateral ligament, portis appeared to move well. after the session, portis, hess, zorn, offensive coordinator <mark>sherman smith</mark>, director of sports medicine bubba tyer and head athletic trainer john burrell met on the field and discussed the situation. portis told the group he could give it a go, and they agreed to let him try. washington quickly benefited from the move as portis played a key role in helping the team take a 7-0 lead. after the cowboys went three and out on the game's opening possession, the redskins traveled 49 yards on 10 plays, the last two yards on campbell's touchdown pass to sellers to the right side. on the drive, portis rushed five times for 29 yards. he gained five yards on his first carry to reach 1,000 yards rushing for the season in his 10th game--the fewest games he has needed to accomplish the feat in his career. with the redskins needing a yard on fourth down at dallas's 11-yard line, portis, who has rushed for at least 1,000 yards six times in his seven-year career, gained nine yards. on the next play, sellers and campbell connected for the touchdown. redskins insider jason la canfora provides exlusive analysis of the redskins.", "articleID": "2008111705_00000238_W", "names": {"Sherman Smith": ["Q3959414", "Q48971430"]}}, {"date":

isleton's city manager said wednesday that if the debt-laden city can't borrow $1 million by the end of the year, he will urge the city council to seek bankruptcy protection. city manager bruce pope, hired in march 2007 to repair the city's failed efforts to properly manage spending and revenues, said in an interview that he has issued several warnings about the fiscal danger the city faces if it cannot borrow $1 million to repay $950,000 in accrued debt. vice mayor <mark>michael gomez</mark> said the bankruptcy question will be discussed at the dec. 10 council meeting. \"time isn't on our side, unfortunately,\" he said, adding, \"the loan seems to be our best option. if that comes through, fantastic. if not, we do need to have a backup plan .\" the city of about 850 has an operating budget of $1.4 million, only slightly more than the needed loan. \"on numerous occasions, i've told (council members) if we don't get the loan, my recommendation the next day would be to go into (bankruptcy),\" pope said. \"i don't see any other options .\" he expects to make that recommendation at the first council meeting in january if no loan comes through. the debt accumulated during years of inattention to budgeting, a problem that helped draw the attention in february of the sacramento county grand jury. among the debts were unpaid obligations to the city's waste management contractor, the contract city attorney, utilities providers and various other creditors. \"they basically took from the accounts and threw them into the general fund and then wrote checks,\" pope said, recalling his discoveries as he worked to repair the city's financial records. \"we have to pay that back .\" more than a year ago pope proposed that the city borrow $1 million to be repaid over 10 years. the city hired an underwriter, which helped create the isleton financing authority to carry out the plan. in the meantime, the city began working with the county to transfer accounting responsibilities to that jurisdiction. in the time it took to lay the groundwork, pope said, the credit market began to tighten. now he's working with three lenders, but he's not optimistic. \"the question is,\" he said, \"are they going to take a shot with isleton?\" in the past year, other cities have begun to show the strain of a tight economy. in may, vallejo sought chapter 9 federal bankruptcy protection. pope said he believes vallejo won't be the last. \"if you look at the massive debt that the state and federal governments have accrued, you see that the little cities in in california are not on anybody's radar,\" pope said. in february, the county grand jury criticized isleton for being \"in a state of perpetual crisis\" and warned that it needed to fix both governance and fiscal problems. it said pope's efforts were helping on the fiscal front but warned that if problems could not be resolved, the city would need to take steps to dissolve itself. pope said he does not favor disincorporation. that would take two to three more years and cost about $300,000, he said. that's money the city doesn't have. call the bee's loretta kalb, (916) 478-2641. dear readers,

that are cast illegally. this year, around 25 percent of all the ballots cast in hennepin county, where minneapolis is located, were by voters who registered at the polls. no one will ever know how many of those votes were illegally cast by illegal aliens, felons, non-minnesota residents, or people who also voted in other precincts or other states-both of which are absurdly easy to do. no doubt, al franken benefited from thousands of illegally cast votes. but there is no way to connect a particular ballot with a specific illegal voter, so it is hard to see how these illegalities can ever be

<mark>david harley</mark>'s thoughts on the film, which is about a high school girl named bella falls in love with a vampire. the new couple leads a rival vampire clan to pursue them and attempt to force her to decide if she, too, wishes to become one of the undead. the film opens in theaters tonight at midnight and is expected to take in close to $70m this weekend. don't forget to back in 2005, my then 12-year-old sister brought home a 498-page novel called twilight. she managed to breeze through it in only a day or two, talking up a storm about how good it was and even hinting that there was a faint possibility i might enjoy it. the premise of a teenage girl falling in love with a vampire, with lots of \"drama\" assumedly thrown into the mix, didn't strike me as anything original or something i'd want to waste a few hours on, so i shrugged it off and forgot about it, only to be reminded of it each subsequent year when the next installment was released. i had no idea how huge stephenie meyer's series was until this past august 1st, when i made a trip to a local bookstore around 7pm. a mob-like crowd of 15-year-olds gathered in the lobby, overtaking the store with their shrill, giddy laughter. \"why are all these people here? did rowling pop out another potter book and i didn't hear about it?\" i asked a worker who was making a feeble attempt to corral the tweens. \"new twilight book comes out at midnight\" she replied. even though i knew the film adaptation had wrapped principal photography back in april and its magazine covers had began to trickle out, it was at that moment, after making it to the periodical rack by wading through a giant crowd, when i realized that twilight was a pop culture phenomenon and a force to be reckoned with. having just seen twilight, a film which has proven itself to be among the most anticipated of the year, i can honestly say that i have no intention of ever reading the books now, simply because there is absolutely no way they can match the utter ridiculousness that oozes from every frame of catherine hardwicke's romantic-fantasy debut. kristen stewart stars as isabella \"bella\" swan, a shy 17-year-old who moves from phoenix, arizona to forks, washington to live with her father, charlie (<mark>billy burke</mark>). walking into biology class on her first day of school, bella spots edward cullen (robert pattinson), an angelic-looking outsider. the two share really bizarre passionate gazes while the wind blows through bella's hair and close-up shots of pouty lips, flickering tongues and deer eyes pop on screen at a more alarming rate than in whatever the last playboy \"best of\" video was. sadly, berlin's take my breath away was mysteriously absent in the background. after several mood swings on edward's behalf, bella eventually picks up on the fact that he's a vampire and makes him own up to it. sexually frustrated and apparently desperate, she falls for the vampire and begins the complicated relationship that will potentially last us for four films. of course, twilight wouldn't be much of a film if it stopped there (then again, it isn't much of a film after it keeps going either); enter james, an evil \"vampire\" who begins stalking bella just because he loves the thrill of the hunt. i feel weird using the word vampire in this review because i felt it was used in the film (and assumedly, the novel) for lack of a better phrase. the \"cold ones\" , as the quileute tribe refers to them as, aren't hurt by the sun, but rather sparkle like the diamond cream from arrested development in it. the cullen clan doesn't drink the blood of humans, only animals, and their body temperatures are frigid. they don't ever sleep, nor do they have fangs and their reflections can be seen in mirrors. they do, however, seem to have character-specific powers bestowed upon them, which are presented with the same quality of cgi found in a children's live-action show. the characters act more like superheroes than vampires, which makes sense in the context of the action-oriented ending and baseball sequence, but not during the goofy tone of the rest of the film. catherine hardwicke gave us thirteen back in 2003, a film that i personally enjoy. what's impressive about that script is that it was written in only six days by hardwicke and 14-year-old actress nikki reed, who takes on the role of rosalie in twilight. even though the character development is rushed, the film is an honest portrayal of the great lengths a teen will go to fit in and find themselves. you know what's impressive about the script for twilight? that a first-time writer/director and a 14-year-old could write more naturally sounding dialogue than an executive co-producer and writer from dexter. characters spout out lines like \"you're my own personal brand of heroin\" and \"hang on, my little spider monkey\" , leaving me confused as to whether it's supposed to be taken seriously or written as a cutesy tween joke. with a running time of a little over two hours, the joke is evidently on me. i hear the books aren't written well either, so maybe this is just a case of trying to stick to the source material to keep fans happy, however terribly conceived it might be to begin with. why would anybody want to see a vampire movie with no blood sucking or fangs!!! sarah
