This week's announcement means that Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland councils will ultimately come together to form a new combined authority which will include an elected mayor, to be chosen in 2019. The three councils decided to go it alone after negotiations for an authority encompassing all seven North East councils collapsed last year. As well as \u00a3 600m over 30 years, the government say the deal will include\" powers over important economic levers including planning and skills \". The full scale of the deal will be revealed soon, but it represents the biggest shake-up to local government in the North East for decades.

His declaration followed a Times report revealing that such women have had to either pay for plane tickets, basic food and shelter themselves or, if they are over 18, take out emergency loans with the department. Tottenham Labour MP David Lammy likened the situation to the Windrush scandal as an indication of how Britons from ethnic minority backgrounds are treated by officialdom .\" A white woman who had been kidnapped, sold into slavery and raped would never have been asked to pay for her freedom, \"he said. It is understood that the forced marriage unit, jointly run by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Home Office, does not profit from the repatriations. A spokeswoman of the FCO, which claims to be a\" world leader in the fight to tackle the brutal practice of forced marriage, \"said that it has a duty to recover costs paid by public funds. The department helped 27 victims of forced marriage return to Britain in 2017 and 55 the year before, according to figures obtained under freedom of information laws. In the past two years the FCO has lent \u00a3 7,765 to at least eight forced marriage victims who could not pay for repatriation. Debts of more than \u00a3 4,500 are outstanding. Under FCO terms and conditions a surcharge of 10 per cent is added if an emergency loan is not repaid within six months. Last year four young British women sent by their families to a\" correctional school \"in Somalia, where they were imprisoned and physically abused, were charged \u00a3 740 each, The Times said. Left destitute by the loans, two are living in refuges and two have become addicted to drugs since returning to Britain, they told the paper. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the situation is\" morally repugnant \"and accused PM Theresa May and Home Secretary Sajid Javid of\" rank hypocrisy \"given their statements made in the past about tackling forced marriages .\" The Foreign Office must immediately scrap these charges and write off all outstanding debts owed by women brought home in recent years, \"Ms Thornberry said. Mr <mark>Hunt</mark> told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he wanted to\" get to the bottom \"of the issue .\" Any interventions that I have had on these consular matters, I have always stressed to embassies and posts abroad that they need to use discretion, \"he said.

Jacquelyn Martin / AP View Slideshow 2 of 2 Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford (left) with <mark>Mattis</mark>, who is departing the administration. Jacquelyn Martin / AP Originally published on December 20, 2018 4:34 pm Updated at 5:46 p.m. ET Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a living Marine Corps legend who made history by securing special permission from Congress to lead the Pentagon, is stepping down after a slow freeze-out by President <mark>Trump</mark>. The president made the announcement via Twitter Thursday evening. \"General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,\" <mark>Trump</mark> wrote. \"General <mark>Mattis</mark> was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!\" t he president also wrote in a second tweet about the departure. <mark>Mattis</mark>' departure completes a near-wholesale shake-up of <mark>Trump</mark>'s initial national security team and follows a record-setting series of departures of administration leaders so early in a presidency. Of <mark>Trump</mark>'s initial top national security or diplomatic policy advisers, only Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who began as CIA director, and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley remain--and Haley is set to depart the administration soon as well. The dismissal followed an abrupt decision by <mark>Trump</mark> this week to withdraw American troops from Syria, over the objections of many of the president's military and national security advisers. And it also followed the publication of a book by Bob Woodward that described <mark>Mattis</mark> as deeply frustrated with <mark>Trump</mark>, likening his understanding to that of a fifth - or sixth-grader, and being put into uncomfortable positions by the president's sometime outbursts. At one point, Woodward describes <mark>Trump</mark> calling <mark>Mattis</mark> and ordering him to assassinate Syrian President Bashar Assad; <mark>Mattis</mark>, according to the account, agreed to \"get right on that\" but ultimately brought about a much more measured low-level cruise missile attack. Following the reports, <mark>Mattis</mark> said, \"The contemptuous words about the president attributed to me in Woodward's book were never uttered by me or in my presence. While I generally enjoy reading fiction, this is a uniquely Washington brand of literature, and his anonymous sources do not lend credibility .\" But on Thursday, <mark>Mattis</mark> wrote in a resignation letter that he felt he could no longer continue to execute <mark>Trump</mark>'s policies. \"Because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours...I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,\" he wrote. <mark>Mattis</mark>' letter cited his support for America's \"unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships .\" <mark>Trump</mark>'s brusque approach to those international relationships, <mark>Mattis</mark> wrote, is one reason the defense secretary feels he must step down. Departure of a major figure <mark>Mattis</mark>' departure is significant. He enjoyed outsize influence with <mark>Trump</mark> from his first day back in government and was, for example, credited with single-handedly changing <mark>Trump</mark>'s mind on the use of harsh interrogation with terrorism suspects. <mark>Trump</mark> campaigned in 2016 on the need to revive brutal techniques such as waterboarding and \"a lot worse,\" but he ceded that policy to <mark>Mattis</mark> after a conversation in which the former Marine general told him he could get better results by offering sympathy in interrogations. \"\"I've always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture,'\" as <mark>Trump</mark> described the conversation. So <mark>Trump</mark> backed away from his stance on torture and continued to lean on <mark>Mattis</mark> for advice about the toughest national security challenges in the early phase of his presidency. <mark>Trump</mark> relied on <mark>Mattis</mark> to execute his orders for two missile attacks on Syria in April in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons, and <mark>Mattis</mark> also played the good cop after <mark>Trump</mark>'s bad cop in dealing with allies in Europe and Asia. <mark>Mattis</mark>' long-standing enmity toward Iran also established a strong trend line in policy for <mark>Trump</mark>, although <mark>Mattis</mark> stopped short of telling members of Congress that the Iran nuclear deal wasn't working. It was working, he said--although <mark>Trump</mark> decided in May to abrogate America's participation in it. But <mark>Trump</mark> also grew frustrated with <mark>Mattis</mark> and the rest of his advisers--including then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson--over the sputtering war in Afghanistan. <mark>Trump</mark>, who had at one time harbored ideas of simply cutting bait on Afghanistan and withdrawing nearly all American troops, found that <mark>Mattis</mark> and his military advisers counseled doubling down with increased deployments, again. The frustration appeared to go both ways. <mark>Mattis</mark> and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford were blindsided by <mark>Trump</mark>'s spur-of-the-moment announcement last summer that the military would ban transgender troops, a policy they opposed. President comes into his own <mark>Trump</mark> grew more confident in his role over time. As the rare president with no experience in elective office or the military, <mark>Trump</mark> had relied on <mark>Mattis</mark> and other advisers of his vintage for on-the-job orientation about America's global security posture and what was considered feasible and not feasible in various regions around the globe. With more time in the job, <mark>Trump</mark> felt more comfortable going his own way, meaning the role that <mark>Mattis</mark> played as a mentor-adviser was diminished. <mark>Trump</mark> was said to have smarted at the notion that there was a \"Committee to Save America,\" comprising <mark>Mattis</mark>, Tillerson and others, which was fencing a feckless <mark>Trump</mark> safely away from serious mistakes. The \"committee,\" if there ever really was one, now is mostly gone--McMaster, Tillerson, former chief economic adviser <mark>Gary Cohn</mark> and several others all have left the administration. According to reports, <mark>Mattis</mark> was cut out of <mark>Trump</mark>'s decision on the Iran deal and also was not aware that <mark>Trump</mark> planned to commit to freezing U.S. and South Korean military exercises as part of nuclear negotiations with North Korea. The overall impression was that <mark>Trump</mark>, at some point along the line, stopped listening to <mark>Mattis</mark> in the way he once had. Myth of \"Mad Dog\" <mark>Mattis</mark> is a three-war veteran with service in Afghanistan and two Iraq wars, first in the 1991 Desert Storm campaign and then again following the 2003 invasion. The Marine Corps ground commander was revered perhaps more than any of his contemporaries--he is the subject of memes, quote pages and other devotional treatments. But when he rose to become head of U.S. Central Command, the military combatant command responsible for the Middle East, he fell out with President Barack Obama's administration, likely over Iran policy. <mark>Mattis</mark> retired and said at the time he did not expect to return to public service. U.S. law barred former commanders of his stature from serving as secretaries of defense until after a cooling-off period, a practice designed to preserve civilian control of the military. But <mark>Mattis</mark> came to the attention of <mark>Trump</mark> after his election, in part because of a nickname he'd picked up in Iraq: \"Mad Dog .\" <mark>Mattis</mark> didn't like the nickname and it was mostly the province of newspaper headlines, but the impression, for <mark>Trump</mark>, was made. President-elect <mark>Trump</mark>, as he then was, invited <mark>Mattis</mark> to join him onstage at a rally in December 2016. <mark>Trump</mark> later sought, and received, a waiver from Congress that permitted <mark>Mattis</mark> to take over the Defense Department, even though he was still technically within the window barring him from a civilian leadership position. If <mark>Trump</mark> thought \"Mad Dog\" <mark>Mattis</mark> was going to be a snarling martinet, however, he did not know his man. The cerebral, often soft-spoken <mark>Mattis</mark> told reporters he preferred the nickname \"Jim .\" He told Congress that his study of history meant he was seldom surprised by world events. All along, however, <mark>Mattis</mark> was aware of his reputation as a \"warrior monk\" and, to the degree that he could in the shadow of a headline-jealous <mark>Trump</mark>, continued cultivating it. John Dickerson of CBS News, for example, asked <mark>Mattis</mark> in an interview what scared him or kept him up at night. \"Nothing,\" he responded. \"I keep other people up at night .\" Copyright 2018 NPR.

June 26 (Warner Bros. / MGM) Cast Josh Wiggins, Lauren Graham, Thomas Yakin After his Marine partner is killed in action, a military working dog is adopted by the soldier's Texas family. The handsome Belgian Malinois who plays the title character in Max (with the help of a few trusty stunt doubles) is an action star par excellence. He's also the only involving character in this blunt instrument of a family drama. The canine trouper fares best not just because of that expressive face and athletic body, but because he's spared the embarrassment of speaking the hokey dialogue. Emotional nuance never has been the forte of director Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans) or his co-scripter, Sheldon Lettich (Rambo III), but here even the broad-stroke storytelling falls short of its intended impact - not helped by the desperate bombast of Trevor Rabin's score. The tale of a war-traumatized military working dog, or MWD, who helps a teen boy and his family overcome their own war-related grief, Max puts a YA slant on an intriguing setup. But the screenplay muddles its emotional core with a clunky cross between old-fashioned Hardy Boys mystery and a far-fetched weapons-trafficking subplot. Families who have already seen Inside Out might be enticed, along with moviegoers who are eager to root for a heroic hound and are not put off by the military angle. Though the movie's good guys and bad guys couldn't be more clearly drawn, that military angle is far from flag-wavingly simplistic (though not exactly complex), with Yakin and Lettich foregrounding PTSD and other devastating effects of frontline battle. Max's post-traumatic stress makes him unable to work with anyone else after his Marine handler, Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell), is killed in Afghanistan. The sight of Max running to Kyle's coffin is wrenching. Summer Movie Guide: Sequels...Comedy...Action! Soon after the funeral, the Wincotts are alerted that Max will be put down, so they decide to adopt him. The decision is spearheaded by mom Pamela (Lauren Graham, lending leavening warmth), who declares, in one of the film's more effective lines, that \"this family takes care of its own .\" Dad Ray, an injured Iraq vet played with overdone rigidity by Thomas Haden Church, comes to blame the dog for his son's death, upping the friction between him and his younger son, Justin (Josh Wiggins of Hellion), who becomes Max's caretaker. With training tips from tough-talking tomboy Carmen (Mia Xitlali) that are drawn straight from the Cesar Millan playbook, Justin puts aside his video-game bootlegging enterprise and learns to handle Max and understand him. He discovers, too, that the dog growls around Kyle's friend and fellow Marine Tyler (Luke Kleintank) for a reason. Having telegraphed Tyler's bad-apple status from the get-go, Yakin draws a widening circle of hard-to-buy connections involving the discharged Marine, local gang leader Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria), a crooked cop (Owen Harn), a Mexican cartel and, farther afield, the Taliban. The baddies naturally include a couple of Rottweilers, and there's some impressive dog-on-dog action as Max assists de-facto detectives Justin, Carmen and her cousin Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) - without having to partake in their \"comic\" exchanges. Animal coordinator Mark Forbes has drawn commendable performances from the dogs, and the stunt sequences, both canine and human, are staged effectively and are shot well by Stefan Czapsky. But they never really matter. And the teens' hangout, a DIY bike park in the woods that's a nice element of Kalina Ivanov's production design, isn't quite enough to explain Justin's daring two-wheeled maneuvers. Though the lead performance would do Lassie and Rin Tin Tin proud, Max's increasingly ludicrous, cliche-packed plot generates not an ounce of suspense.

An agreement between the Potters and the Irish FA allows O\u2019Neill to remain in charge of Northern Ireland for the fixtures next spring--their last chance of reaching Euro 2020 after Saturday's 0-0 draw with Holland closed the door on automatic qualification. On Friday, O\u2019Neill refused to say definitively he would still be at the helm of the national team as he adjusts to the demands of the Championship, but speaking after the game he was adamant selecting a squad and scouting the opposition--who will be named in Friday's draw--would not pose a problem. \"It's dead easy,\" he said. \"We're going to turn up on a Sunday and play on a Thursday. I can pick my squad now. I could name it tomorrow. There are not 40 players out there we're not picking .\" I'll be able to (prepare for the opposition). That's not a problem. Our opponents don't play between now and then, they've already played. We're not going to watch individual players play for their clubs, so the work we have on the opponents, we'll have that well in advance. \"O\u2019Neill had previously suggested\" common sense will prevail \"regarding his situation and they would find the\" right resolution for everyone \", comments taken as meaning he may find the demands on his time too much. But that was not the position he took after Saturday's draw--a game Northern Ireland might have won but for a missed penalty from captain <mark>Steven Davis</mark> in the first half .\" In this job, I could watch 40 games or two games and 99 per cent of the time, my squad will be pretty much the same, so people are making a lot out of this situation, which doesn't exist, \"he said .\" To be honest, there's nobody better than me to judge this because I actually do the job and the reality of the situation is to put a coach in with a play-off situation with three days' preparation wouldn't be fair to the players or the association because of what's at stake. \"And it wouldn't be fair to the coach to go and prepare .\" We know our team, we know our best team. We have one or two players to come back in--Conor Washington and <mark>Jordan Jones</mark>--but the squad picks itself other than that. \"Either way, virtually every play-off permutation has Northern Ireland playing away, making Saturday almost certainly O\u2019Neill's Windsor Park farewell with Tuesday's final Group C fixture away to Germany in Frankfurt. He will end his tenure having taken charge of 32 games at the National Stadium, winning 17, drawing six and losing nine, a record he is proud of .\" I think this stadium used to be a place where at times (our own) players and fans dreaded coming, and performances showed that, \"he said .\" Now we have a great atmosphere here, the redevelopment of the stadium has been a big factor in that but what we also have is a group of players who love playing here and a really strong bond between the supporters and the players. \"It's really important we hold on to that going forward, regardless of who's in charge of the team .\" 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2019052121_00224135_W", "names": {"Scott Morrison": ["Q1286476", "Q21285393", "Q7436904", "Q7436906", "Q7436908"], "Stan Grant": ["Q7597664", "Q7597665"], "Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Kerry Brown": ["Q55615855", "Q6394477", "Q6394478", "Q6394480"]}, "date": "2019-05-21", "url": "http://mideastafrica.foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/21/scott-morrison-won-australias-election-against-all-odds-it-shouldnt-have-come-as-a-surprise-alp-shorten-folau-religion/", "content": "Argument <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> Won Australia's Election Against All Odds. It Shouldn't Have Come as a Surprise. The Australian Labor Party made the same mistakes that have led to failure for center-left leaders across the globe--and the right is reaping the benefits. By <mark>Stan Grant</mark> | May 21, 2019, 4:44 PM Australian Prime Minister <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> (C) shakes hands with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (L) at a special ecumenical service to mark the start of the parliamentary year at St Paul's Anglican church on Feb. 12 in Canberra, Australia. Tracey Nearmy/Getty Images Understanding Australia's shock election last weekend, in which the right-wing coalition of incumbent Prime Minister <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> unexpectedly won, requires looking to an unlikely source: a conservative Christian rugby star. The pundits didn't see it coming, but they don't spend too much time in church pews. Israel Folau, one of the most outstanding athletes of his generation, has become a lightning rod for debate about freedom of religion in Australia. Folau had his contract with Rugby Australia terminated after he posted a social media message six weeks ago that said, among other things, that gay people were sinners doomed for hell unless they repented and accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. He has been accused of hate speech, causing offense to the LGBTQ community, and breaching the game's code of conduct. What was a heated sports issue spilled over into politics in the final week of election campaigning. <mark>Morrison</mark> shares a similar Pentecostal Christian faith with Folau, and he was asked by journalists if he agreed with the rugby legend and also condemned gay Australians. <mark>Morrison</mark> replied as politicians do: He said he separated his politics and his faith. But within hours, Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition progressive Labor Party, seized on the remark, seeing a chance to damage the prime minister. But playing politics with faith was a misstep--perhaps a fatal one. Shorten's move raised red flags in the minds of many voters. Just what did he stand for? Did he value the rights of the LGBTQ community not to be offended over the rights of someone to publicly profess their religious beliefs? It came in the same week that Shorten had given a rousing speech pledging to \"change the nation forever .\" But did Australians really want their country changed? Shorten had already outlined an agenda of social change: an ambitious plan for indigenous rights, making Australia a republic (something that had been put to the Australian people and rejected in 1999), as well as higher taxes on what Shorten called \"the big end of town .\" It was old-style class politics, and it spooked some Australians. Retirees, middle-class parents, and those dependent on the mining industry for their livelihoods all felt they were in the firing line. Christian leaders now say that religious freedom was a sleeper issue that turned votes in critical marginal seats. This was the so-called unlosable election for Shorten, who lost to <mark>Morrison</mark>'s predecessor in the 2016 federal election; opinion polls stretching back more than two years said the conservative government was doomed. It was wracked with division, having dumped two prime ministers in internal party coups. They went into the election light on policy but led by a new leader big on faith. Within hours of the vote count, it was clear the polls had been hopelessly wrong. Grand narratives are often foolhardy, and something as complex as an election can't be so tidily explained. But there is a realignment taking place. The wave that has broken across liberal democracies in the West has washed up in Australia. The conservatives have been in power for six years, and after this victory some analysts are predicting at least another six more. Throughout the world, long-silent voices are making themselves heard and it is shaking up politics as usual. In the United States, <mark>Donald Trump</mark> tapped into the frustration of those who felt left behind and promised to make their country great again; Viktor Orban in Hungary has entrenched his leadership by toughening the borders and stopping refugees; in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, far-right parties are increasing their popularity. At its worst, there are fears of resurgent fascism--certainly nationalism is back. People are saying they want to belong and they want their leaders to put them first. On immigration, trade, climate change policy, and more, countries are putting themselves first amid a blowback against multilateralism and globalization. After two decades marked by Middle East wars, the financial meltdown, and the Great Recession of 2008, whatever consensus had held around the free movement of goods and people and pooled sovereignty is looking frayed. Australia's election is not its <mark>Trump</mark> or Brexit moment as some have suggested--the picture here is too complicated for that. Overall, Australia's democracy is strong: The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index has placed Australia in the top 10 for the past decade. It is a country not given to political extremes; it is centrist and broadly conservative with a strong ethos of what Australians call a \"fair go\" for all. Australia avoided the worst of the financial crisis and has had nearly 30 years of uninterrupted economic growth in part fueled by a mining boom driven by China's hunger for Australia's natural resources. Compulsory voting also cushions Australia against get-out-the-vote campaigns and voter suppression efforts that can be so decisive in countries like the United States. But there are similarities: The political divide so critical elsewhere in the world is alive in Australia. It has been dubbed the \"quinoa curtain\" --the split between city and country, particularly the heavily mining-dependent state of Queensland, which broke heavily conservative in the election. The other similarity is that Shorten, like progressives globally, lost the ability to talk to big numbers of Australians--whether on religious freedoms, free speech, tax, or climate change policy. He created too many potential losers. Even worse, he lost the ability to listen. He wanted to change Australians, but he didn't think to ask if they wanted changing. Progressive hubris plays into the hands of the conservative right. The right is at home talking about nation and family and faith. <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> is a Christian, rugby-loving, suburban family man. In Australia we would endearingly call him a \"bogan .\" He is also a tough politician who knows his side: As immigration minister in 2013 and 2014 he turned back refugee boats and toughened Australia's border patrol; he once brought a lump of coal into Parliament to argue against shutting down mines to appease environmentalists. <mark>Morrison</mark> dedicated his victory to the \"quiet Australians .\" He claims to like them just as they are and does not seek to change them. Progressive politicians in Australia, like everywhere, are now realizing that if they want change, they need to win power--and that means bringing the people with them rather than telling them what's good for them. Two days before Australia's federal election, one of the country's most loved and popular former prime ministers, Bob Hawke, passed away. He came to power in the 1980s as a former union leader and towering figure of the left, but his message was summed up in one word: consensus. In four elections, he was never defeated. And he was a rugby fan.

Guardiola was too modest to agree. Pep Guardiola insists his side have more to prove before they can call themselves the world's best team (Martin Rickett/PA) \"Thank you but we are not the best,\" he said. \"To be the best we have to win the titles and we did not win the titles to be the best in the world .\" Guardiola feels Tuesday's 2-1 victory at Watford, when City endured a nervy finish after dominating early on, underlines this point. He said: \"We could have dropped two points in the last 10 minutes. After 2-0 we were not the best side. There are many things we can do better and tomorrow we have a very demanding test for us .\" Guardiola has been impressed by the work of Sarri so far in his first season at Chelsea. He said: \"He needs time. Maybe they are not playing 90 minutes but when they play good for 50, 60, 70, 75 minutes they are excellent .\" 0 comments"}]
