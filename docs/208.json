AstraZeneca Thumbs up or down on megamergers? Depends on your point of view Eisai's revved-up Belviq marketing starting to pay off, analysts say Reprint Pfizer may not get a great shot at buying AstraZeneca this fall--but it's preparing to give it a try. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports, the U.S.-based drug giant is looking at Actavis, the generics maker with a new home address in Ireland, among other targets. That domicile is a key factor, of course, given Pfizer's (Warner Chilcott last year. That deal--and its subsequent buyout of U.S.-based Forest Laboratories--also built up Actavis' business in branded pharmaceuticals. So in addition to the company's large portfolio of generic meds, Actavis would bring along a few notable brands, and some newly approved meds. So, an Actavis buy would build up Pfizer's established products unit, widely seen as the first prospect for another sale or spin-off. It would add some new products to Pfizer's branded stable, which is in need of help. And because of Actavis' recent buying spree, it's worth some $59 billion--large enough to allow Pfizer to shift its domicile to Dublin, Bloomberg says. Whether Actavis is receptive to Pfizer's advances isn't clear; the smaller company didn't comment. Whether Pfizer would prefer Actavis, AstraZeneca ($AZN) or another buy? The company won't say, of course; Pfizer's spokeswoman Joan Campion told Bloomberg her company is continuing to \"evaluate all opportunities, regardless of size, through the lens of value creation for our shareholders and enhancing the competitiveness of our business.\" That pretty well echoes what CEO <mark>Ian Read</mark> said during the company's Q2 earnings call. Analysts and media reports have trotted out a variety of other potential Pfizer targets--even GlaxoSmithKline ($VRX), Bloomberg points out, but the Canadian drugmaker is embroiled in a hostile move to buy Allergan. The history of Pfizer's AstraZeneca bid is well documented. So is the U.K. M & A code that prevents Pfizer from mounting a new offer until November. What Bloomberg points out now is that, since Pfizer's most recent foray, AstraZeneca has raised its 2014 revenue forecast, bought a portfolio of respiratory meds from Spain's Almirall and trotted out some promising data for three cancer drugs. That means AstraZeneca would likely raise its asking price even further, Helvea analyst Odile Rundquist told the news service. \"My impression is that the deal will never go through, because it is too expensive for Pfizer.\" Will he or won't he?

The House passed Senate Bill 99 on a 60-40 vote. It will be up for a final vote on Wednesday. The bill passed out of the Senate in February on a 30-20 vote before moving to the House. It would establish the \"Montana Federal Firearm, Magazine and Ammunition Ban Enforcement Prohibition Act.\" Rep. Seth Berglee, R-Joliet, is carrying the bill in the House for Sen. <mark>Cary Smith</mark>, R-Billings. \"We did add a couple of amendments to it to allow for federal assistance, as long as it is not for the primary purpose of prohibiting, restricting or requiring any of the federal bans,\" Berglee said. At the bill's first hearing in the House Patrick Audet, lobbyist for the School Administrators of Montana, opposed the bill and said it would allow firearms on school campuses. \"If an officer couldn't enforce that law, that would be a problem. We would be opposed to that,\" Audet said. Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association, said Audet is referring to a federal act called the \"Gun-Free School Zones Act.\" The act prohibits anyone from openly carrying a loaded firearm (one that's not properly stowed) within 1,000 feet from school grounds. Marbut supported SB 99 and said past legislation already exempts Montana from that law. \"The Legislature passed a statute, frankly that I wrote, that said because we have the right to keep and bear arms in Montana every law-abiding adult is deemed to be licensed by the state, pursuant to the federal\" Gun-Free School Zones Act, \"' Marbut said. Marbut said the only other ban for firearms on school grounds is a different one called the\" Gun-Free Schools Act, \"in which the federal government encourages each state to introduce their own laws for firearms on campus. He said since that ban would be considered a state law, a school resource officer's enforcement of the state's ban would not be affected by the bill.

prevent protests at the funeral of a leading political prisoner, an activist said, after the death of the hunger-striking detainee sparked international outrage. cuban president raul castro \"regrets the death of cuban prisoner orlando zapata tamayo, who died yesterday after having been on a hunger strike,\" a foreign ministry statement said. but castro denied allegations of repression in the americas' only one-party communist regime after the late dissident's mother charged her son was tortured. \"there are no tortured people, there were no tortured people, there was no execution,\" raul castro, 78, told reporters. \"that is what happens at (the us naval base in) guantanamo.\" the government's initial reaction however appeared to be to move swiftly against other dissidents. elizardo sanchez, spokesman for the outlawed commission for human rights and national reconciliation, told afp that security agents had detained about 30 activists tuesday and wednesday. \"some also have been held in their houses, without a judicial warrant, to prevent people from going to the wake,\" he said. dissidents have been rounded up in the eastern provinces of santiago de cuba, guantanamo, las tunas and camaguey, and in the central city of placetas, sanchez said. zapata, 42, was to be buried in his hometown of banes, 830 kilometers (500 miles) east of havana, after a wake at the home of his mother. \"my son was tortured the whole time he was in prison,\" reina luisa tamayo charged in a video on the blog generacion y, run by independent journalist yoani sanchez in defiance of havana's tightly controlled state media. tamayo implored \"the international community to demand the release of the rest of (cuba's political) prisoners...so that what happened to my boy does not happen again.\" zapata's death drew international condemnation and calls for an investigation. jailed since 2003 and deemed a prisoner of conscience by amnesty international, zapata had blamed his already deteriorating health on harsh conditions inside cuba's jails. sanchez said it was the first time in nearly 40 years that a cuban opposition figure has died while on a hunger strike. zapata's death is \"bad news for the human rights movement and for the government as well,\" he said. the movement \"is not seeking martyrs,\" said oswaldo paya, leader of the christian liberation movement dissident group. zapata died \"defending the freedom, rights and dignity of all cubans,\" paya added. in washington, us state department spokesman philip crowley said zapata's death \"highlights the injustice of cuba's holding more than 200 political prisoners who should now be released without delay.\" related article: us urges cuba to free political prisoners the eu commission also voiced deep regret at zapata's death. the european union urges the cuban government \"to improve effectively the human rights situation in the country by releasing unconditionally all political prisoners,\" eu commission spokesman <mark>john clancy</mark> told afp. related article: eu \"deeply regrets' death of cuban hunger striker cuba claims it has no political prisoners; it says regime opponents are all\" mercenaries \"in the pay of the united states or right-wing cuban exiles. zapata was one of 55\" prisoners of conscience \"adopted by amnesty international in cuba, most of whom were also arrested in the 2003 government crackdown on activists seeking political change. initially given a three-year prison term, zapata saw his sentence grow to 36 years as the government piled on additional charges of\" disobedience \"and\" disorder in a penal establishment. \"amnesty international said zapata\" felt he had no other avenue available to him but to starve himself in protest is a terrible indictment of the continuing repression of political dissidents in cuba. \"hector palacios, one of 75 political prisoners convicted in 2003 and who met zapata in prison, told afp\" people are outraged, \"and that a national mourning and fasting period was being weighed."}, {"articleID": "2013040410_00018826_W", "names": {"Brad Pitt": ["Q35332", "Q373912"]}, "date": "2013-04-04", "url":

hollywood movies have already begun catering to a growing chinese audience. most recently, the makers behind the anticipated third-installment of the marvel superhero series \"iron man,\" which was partially shot in china, announced that a different version of the film will be released, and it will differ from what audiences outside of china will see. the chinese version of the trailer, which can be seen above, also differs from the movie's american trailers, as it more prominently features chinese actors and settings. typically, when china releases its own version of a hollywood movie, it means the film did not pass the sometimes-arbitrary standards of the nation's media censorship group, the state administration of radio, film and television, which is this time, however, legendary comic book company marvel is behind the decision to create the special china-version of \"iron man 3,\" starring robert downey jr. in the title role. according to the diplomat, chinese actress fan bingbing will be in the chinese version of the movie, but her scenes will be cut from all non-chinese showings. but marvel explained that chinese audiences can expect more than just fan bingbing. \"the chinese version of the film will also feature a special appearance of china's top actress, fan bingbing, and will offer specially prepared bonus footage exclusively for the chinese audience,\" the company noted. in addition, chinese actor wang xueqi will be featured in both versions of the movie. the production of \"iron man 3\" has received a lot of international attention for its friendly involvement with chinese authorities while filming and for its use of chinese actors. \"marvel studios' experience working on this film with fan bingbing and wang xueqi and in shooting in china has been very positive and has created a springboard for future collaboration with china's talented stars and its growing film and television industry,\" marvel said. marvel isn't the only entertainment company with eyes on china. paramount pictures had a screening of their upcoming zombie movie, \"world war z,\" which stars <mark>brad pitt</mark>, for executives and decided to make a minor change to the film, keeping in mind a major audience: china. the wrap, paramount decided to alter a minor plot detail, changing the geographic origin of an outbreak that eventually caused the zombie apocalypse from china to a different location. while paramount executives say that the plot does not hinge on china being the origin, they made the change to be conscious of the fast-growing chinese market, and the state censorship that would have likely carried out the the change for them. just yesterday, paramount announced that the making of another potential blockbuster, \"transformers 4,\" will involve working with china. entertainment weekly is reporting that paramount will be co-producing the movie with two high-profile chinese companies, china movie channel and jiaflix enterprises."},

Toyota team practice to improve their efficiency changing tires and pouring gas, to ensure they can save precious seconds necessary to maintain track position. Today, the team banded together with colleagues from <mark>Joe Gibbs</mark> Racing, NASCAR and M & M'S to make improvements of a different kind. This unique team, comprised of more than 50 volunteers, is helping build two Habitat for Humanity of Charlotte homes in the Charlotte area, which includes the future homes of Yasin Mohamed and Egland Isak and their three children, as well as Kung Mang and Sung Thluai and their two children. The effort is part of M & M'S M'Prove America? campaign, a year-long partnership with Habitat designed to fund construction of new Habitat homes across the United States. Fans can join Busch and M & M'S by pledging to volunteer their time and talents at Habitat for Humanity build sites across the country at www.mproveamerica.com. This year, M & M'S is encouraging its associates and fans to log an ambitious 1.5 million minutes - or 25,000 hours - of volunteer time with Habitat. \"Charlotte has always been good to the NASCAR community - and especially to me and my teammates,\" said Kyle Busch. \"So it feels great to help two local families fulfill their dreams of homeownership. I encourage all race fans to join M & M'S in the effort to M'Prove America in their own hometowns, as there are few things in life as rewarding as helping a neighbor.\" In addition to encouraging fans to volunteer time, M & M'S is also making a donation of $500,000 to Habitat for Humanity to fund the construction of Habitat homes in 2013. Later this month, M & M'S will also introduce specially marked M'Prove America packages of red, white and blue M & M'S? Brand Candies in stores nationwide. The M & M'S M'Prove America campaign will also be on display during the Coca-Cola 600 on May 26 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when Busch gets behind the wheel of a special No. 18 M & M'S M'Prove America Toyota.

It was probably only about four degrees, really cold, and I got inside. Sweat from me is hitting the ground hard so I knew I wasn't right,\" he said of the match against Cambridge University. \"That's when I thought I was going to die.\" <mark>Taylor</mark>, 26, thought he was suffering from a viral infection but scans showed he had a heart condition known as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Arrhythmia (ARVC), the same condition that almost killed former Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba. The middle-order batsman played seven tests and 27 one-day internationals for England and captained the side against Ireland in May last year. Speaking to the BBC, <mark>Taylor</mark> said he had no inkling of the heart complaint as the new season loomed and was \"in hysterics\" when doctors first told him he would have to retire. \"I was feeling good as gold, in fact my lead up to this season was probably the best I've ever felt, mentally and technically,\" he said. \"When the doctor told me I was in hysterics at first.\" But then he told me that the majority of these cases are only found out in the post-mortem. I almost stopped crying at that point and felt more lucky that I'm in a position to tell this story now, \"added <mark>Taylor</mark>."}]
