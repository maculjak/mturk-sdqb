Photograph: Press 22 <mark>Steve Collins</mark>, father of murdered Limerick businessman Roy Collins, has moved back to the city to rebuild his family's life, he has said. The family fled Ireland in recent years to try and overcome the devastation wreaked on the them by gangland violence and intimidation. Mr Collins led a campaign, including street marches through Limerick, against the rampant criminality in the city and emigrated after testifying against members of the Dundon McCarthy gang who murdered his son in 2009. In October 2017, Wayne Dundon and Nathan Killeen, who are serving life sentences for the murder, had their convictions upheld by the Court of Appeal. Exactly ten years to the day of the killing of 35-year-old father-of-two Roy at the Coin Castle amusements arcade they ran at Roxboro Road in Limerick, his father said it was time to build a new life for his other son Steven in their home city. \"There is inward investment all the time now (in Limerick), we have the hanging gardens and the likes of that here now,\" he said. \"We have invested heavily in a bar here, my son Steven runs it. Father of murdered Roy Collins hopes others will give evidence\" We are trying to rebuild our lives, trying to rebuild Steven's life, to give him something to hold on to. We were comfortable in this city before all this came on our door, then we were destroyed and devastated in every way - this is a rebuilding thing now. \"Mr Collins said he remains\" haunted \"by his ordeal .\" It never leaves you...you never expect it to come into your life, the horrific way it happened, \"he said .\" It's a loss you never get over, nobody ever gets over losing a child - it doesn't matter what age they are. We are just happy to be moving on now. \"Mr Collins praised the support of the people of Limerick who came out onto the streets in solidarity with his family when they began their campaign against gang violence .\" It gave us the impetus to move on and talk to politicians and campaign to get the law changed. I think we've achieved that with the 2009 Justice Act, \"he said .\" I think Limerick is a different place. When we came back we noticed it how things have changed. The investment is coming into the city now. That wouldn't happened back in the day, in 2009. \"For such a small city, it was crazy. To get change, it is heartening .\" Mr Collins told RT\u00c9 Radio's Morning Ireland the change came at a huge cost to his family and the stress has \"put an awful burden\" on their health. \"We relocated to try rebuild our lives again, but it was tough, we always wanted to come back in Limerick. We sacrificed an awful lot for this city .\" It took the people of Limerick to stand up and say \"we are sick of this\" , he said, to bring about the changes. \"I'm just so happy it happened...this didn't just help Limerick - it helped the whole country .\" ", "articleID": "2019040908_00454711_W", "names": {"Steve Collins": ["Q1337988", "Q16194486", "Q2346903", "Q48817948", "Q7612235", "Q7612236"]}}, {"date": "2019-04-09", "url": "http://www.inverelltimes.com.au/story/6011642/labor-pushes-investigation-into-phone-tower-on-rineharts-kingstown-property/?src=rss", "content": "Local News news, local-news, An investigation request into a phone tower on Gina Rinehart's New England property has been filed with the Auditor-General. A letter from Labor's regional communications spokesman <mark>Stephen Jones</mark> has asked that the decision to place the tower on the Kingstown property be scrutinised. \"I believe the decision-making around the location of this particular base station should be investigated to ascertain if proper departmental procedures were adhered to and if decision-making was influenced by factors outside of the program objectives,\" Mr <mark>Jones</mark> wrote. \"I understand that you are already considering an audit of Round 3 of this program .\" In that round, the Coalition Government selected the locations for co-funding, leading to criticisms from state governments alleging the program was not delivering good outcomes for the community. \"Kingstown residents have complained that the tower has been plagued by reception problems since it was switched on two weeks ago. Member for New England Barnaby Joyce campaigned for the tower and announced it as part of the federal government's Mobile Black Spot program in June 2015. He said he had no say in the exact location of the phone tower in Kingstown. Mr Joyce told The Inverell Times on Tuesday afternoon that the referral of the issue to the auditor-general was a political stunt .\" The Labor Party of course will play games, this is a political tactic, \"he said .\" I could refer anything; I could refer Mr <mark>Jones</mark> if I wanted too. \"Mr Joyce said he worked to get the funding for the tower in the village, but where it is placed is up to Telstra. He rejected any assertion he had any dealings with Gina Rinehart on the issue, and said the government and Telstra negotiated with the previous owners of the property, prior to her purchase\" I have never have had any conversation with Ms Rinehart with any purchase of hers in the New England, \"Mr Joyce said .\" Any negotiations about the phone tower do not include me; I provide the money for a phone tower in Kingstown, it's up to Telstra where it puts it. \"If it was up to me, I would have put it on top of the hill so that it gives coverage to the whole town .\" The tower is located on Sundown Valley, a property purchased by Gina Rinehart's pastoral arm, Hancock Agriculture, in August last year. But the contract with Telstra to host the tower was signed by the previous owners, Hancock Agriculture chief executive David Larkin told the Times, and said the annual rent paid on the tower was not a motivation. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) will now consider the request, a spokesman for the Auditor-General said. \"As outlined in the ANAO corporate plan, the Auditor-General aims to respond to the vast majority, 90 per cent, of requests for audit within 28 days,\" he said. It's not the first time the federal government's Mobile Black Spot program has been referred to the national audit body. READ MORE: Third drought assistance package announced A 2016 ANAO investigation found the $110 million program did not target the funding to areas where coverage had not previously existed. At least 89 of the 499 base stations provided minimal new coverage at a cost of $28 million; that means the public funded a program that did not extend coverage into new areas. The investigation also found that there was not a structured method for assessing the technical and financial aspects of proposals. It found that the department's ability to measure the effectiveness of the program was difficult, given there was no way to evaluate it. https: //nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/hAWJC77isbRCSsmqzS5A6F/777f8a0f-e2fb-46d6-bfb0-652852e883cf.png/r2_0_1152_650_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "articleID": "2019040923_00109917_W", "names": {"Stephen Jones": ["Q11836360", "Q1380938", "Q17476791", "Q2374211", "Q25345871", "Q2670107", "Q4160428", "Q43565191", "Q47119713", "Q56598186", "Q7609616", "Q7609617", "Q7609618", "Q7609619", "Q7609620", "Q7609622", "Q7609623", "Q7612967"]}}, {"date": "2019-04-10", "url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/apr/10/woman-lived-to-99-with-most-organs-on-wrong-side-of-body-1962606.html", "content": "Home World Woman lived to 99 with most organs on wrong side of body The discovery of the rare condition, which was presented this week to a conference of anatomists, was astounding especially because Bentley had lived so long. Share Via Email Published: 10th April 2019 11:45 AM | Last Updated: 10th April 2019 11:45 AM | A + A A - Rose Marie Bentley. By PTI SALEM: Rose Marie Bentley was an avid swimmer, raised five kids, helped her husband run a feed store, and lived to the ripe age of 99. It was only after she died that medical students discovered that all her internal organs \"except for her heart' were in the wrong place. The discovery of the rare condition, which was presented this week to a conference of anatomists, was astounding especially because Bentley had lived so long. People with the condition known as situs inversus with levocardia often have life-threatening cardiac ailments and other abnormalities, according to Oregon Health & Science University. <mark>Cameron Walker</mark>'s class at the university in Portland was examining the heart of a cadaver last year when they noticed the blood vessels were different. When they opened the abdominal cavity, they saw that all the other organs were on the wrong side. The unusual blood vessels helped the heart compensate. In a telephone interview Tuesday, <mark>Walker</mark> described his reaction to the find as\" definitely a mix of curiosity, fascination and a sense of wanting to explore a little bit of a medical mystery' a medical marvel really' that was in front of us. \"\"And I would say the students felt something very similar,\" <mark>Walker</mark>, an assistant professor of anatomy, told The Associated Press. Bentley's family had not known about the condition, which OHSU says occurs only once in every 22,000 births. Apparently, Bentley didn't either. Bentley, who lived in Molalla, 40 kilometers south of Portland, had led a normal life. Her only recurrent physical complaint was arthritis, her daughter Louise Allee remembered. But there were signs. When Bentley was in her 50s, she underwent a hysterectomy, and the doctor also wanted to remove the appendix. But he couldn't find it, Allee said in a phone interview. When Bentley had her gallbladder removed at least a decade later, it was on the opposite side of where it should have been, she said. \"No one said a thing,\" Allee said. Bentley had agreed to donate her body to OHSU, Oregon's only academic health center. \"This is an important case that really gave us an opportunity to talk about the importance of future clinicians paying attention to subtle anatomic variations, not just large anatomic variations, in terms of addressing their future patients as individuals,\" <mark>Walker</mark> said. \"Don't judge a book by its cover, and always check and see what you've got before you talk about care .\" He has researched how long people with the condition have lived, and he found no documented cases in which a person lived beyond age 73. Bentley surpassed that by 26 years. Her husband, James, died about 15 years ago.

They forecheck. They backcheck. They block shots and take few risks, more focused on fundamentals than flash. It's a style designed to frustrate opponents regardless of pedigree, one that has them on the cusp of just their second playoff series win in more than a quarter century. Jordan Eberle and Brock Nelson scored 62 seconds apart in the first period to quickly erase an early deficit, Robin Lehner stopped 25 shots, and the Islanders moved within one victory of finishing off Sidney Crosby and the rest of the frustrated Pittsburgh Penguins with a 4-1 win Sunday to take a 3-0 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal series. It's heady territory for a franchise that's advanced past the first round just once since 1993. Yet the Islanders certainly look like they belong on the big stage. They've outscored Pittsburgh 11-5 through three games and have trailed for less than four minutes against a team that began the playoffs looking to capture its third Stanley Cup in four years, a dream that's all but vanished. \"We kind of did our best to play simple hockey and really just grind it out a little bit,\" said Islanders forward Anders Lee, whose empty-net goal with 1:28 to go pushed his team to the cusp of an unlikely sweep. While they lack Pittsburgh's offensive firepower, the Islanders have made up for it with depth and resiliency. Rather than get rattled after Garrett Wilson gave the Penguins just their second lead of the series when he redirected a point shot past Lehner midway through the first period, the Islanders responded immediately. Eberle beat <mark>Matt Murray</mark> short side from just above the goal line 28 seconds after Wilson's goal, and Nelson finished off a 2-on-1 just over a minute later to put New York in front to stay. Lehner withstood a series of pushes by the Penguins, and the Islanders counterpunched brilliantly in the third period, getting goals from Leo Komarov and Lee to pull away. \"Playoffs are all about momentum,\" said Eberle, who has three goals in the series. \"When you can take some team's momentum away and just continue to build yours, it's key .\" <mark>Matt Murray</mark> finished with 32 saves for the Penguins, but Pittsburgh again struggled to generate sustained offensive pressure. New York, which allowed an NHL-low 196 goals on its way to a second-place finish in the Metropolitan Division, has clamped down on Crosby and linemate Jake Guentzel. The two combined for 75 goals and 101 assists during the regular season but have yet to record a point in this series. Pittsburgh needs a win in Game 4 on Tuesday to avoid being swept for the first time since the 2013 Eastern Conference finals against Boston. \"You've got to find ways to score goals this time of year,\" Crosby said. \"It's not easy, but you've got to find a way to do it, and obviously we haven't done a good job of it through the first three games .\" NOTES AVALANCHE: Cale Makar is about to jump from one grueling playoff run straight into another. The 20-year-old defenseman signed a three-year, entry-level deal with Colorado, a day after his UMass squad lost in the Frozen Four championship game. Makar, who's from Calgary, could make his NHL debut Monday in Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Calgary Flames. The series is tied at a game apiece. \"I want to make sure he's in, rested, prepared and focused on what we're doing here now. Then we'll make a decision on when we get him in the lineup,\" Avalanche Coach Jared Bednar said. \"It's definitely a big step up from the college game, especially when you're jumping in mid-series, in a heated playoff round, against such a good opponent like Calgary. It's my job to make sure I'm putting him in a position to succeed .\" The 6-foot, 192-pound Makar was the fourth overall pick by Colorado in the 2017 draft. He recently won the Hobey Baker Memorial Award as college hockey's top player after a season in which he had 16 goals and 33 assists in 41 games.
