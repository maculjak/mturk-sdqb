none of their starters played? i don't believe you. nonetheless, a win is a win is a win. derek was check out his excellent recap if you get the chance. the sixers continue their pre-season adventures tonight against the toronto raptors. and in case you were worried, mike preston confirmed that they landed in toronto late last night. sources close to me saying they flew on hippogriffs the entire way but i'm still searching for confirmation. tonight's match-up will be televised on nba league pass (channel game1) which i believe is currently free to anybody who's cable provider supports it. unfortunately, it's the raptors broadcast team so no ear candy in the name of marc zumoff for us tonight. but let's get to the links of the day, shall we? today we will recap last night's win, address <mark>collins</mark>' bold jrue holiday prediction, learn about tiered ticket pricing, and 10 reasons to check out the sixers this season. kapono came off the bench and threw down four three-pointers to account for his 12 points and also dealt four assists in 19 very active minutes. \"it was cool,\" he said. \"i didn't expect to play as i sat the whole first half, but i'm a professional, and i'm ready to play and help this team. i feel that my skill of shooting can really help this team .\" williams led the sixers with 19 points and marreese speights added 16 to lead seven players in double-digit scoring. <mark>collins</mark> was pleased that the team had 29 fastbreak points and made 10 of 12 from three-point range. \"as frustrating as it is, especially since i felt like i came into training camp in great shape and was doing well, you just have to look at the big picture at the end of the day. i thought it was just soreness from training camp, but it just never really got better. now, compared to, like, 3 or 4 days ago, i'm feeling a lot better. before, just walking around was kind of a struggle. but now with all the stretching, i'm making progress. i would say about a week more now .\" <mark>collins</mark> addresses his jrue holiday early prediction: phillyburbs.com unlike in his rookie campaign, holiday is facing high expectations - some of which were brought on by <mark>doug collins</mark> saying he could be one of the league's top five point guards by the end of this year. \"you know what, that's good,\" <mark>collins</mark> said before tuesday's 103-92 victory over the shorthanded celtics at the wells fargo center. \"expectations are only placed on people with talent. i've always said i like people to put expectations on me because they feel i'm supposed to do a good job. i think you learn to deal with that .\" \"expectations can either derail you or they can drive you to bigger things. i think jrue's the kind of kid who's going to be lifted by expectations .\" thaddeus young said he and his teammates are confident holiday will be fine. \"he has a whole new system and a whole new everything,\" <mark>young</mark> said. \"he's going to figure a way to accommodate us and get back to his old self .\" \"i know the celtics' starters didn't play, but still that's a very tough defensive team,\" sixers coach <mark>doug collins</mark> said. \"was it against the celtics' second team? yeah, but i'm not going to diminish the fact that our guys fought back and won that game, because it looked pretty ugly with about six minutes gone in the third .\" none of <mark>collins</mark>' starters - jrue holiday, andre iguodala, <mark>young</mark>, and brand - played fewer than 28 minutes, but both iguodala and brand sat for the fourth quarter. <mark>collins</mark> played 10 players, using four substitutes (lou williams, marreese speights, andres nocioni) for more than 18 minutes. speights led the sixers with 19 points. dei lynam recaps last night's pre-season matchup: csn philly with 20 seconds left in third andre iguodala was pusing the ball in transition he spotted an open kapono for three. kapono thought about it and then made the extra pass to williams for a corner three which is closer. <mark>collins</mark> had emphasized such execution on sunday. his team was up two heading into the final frame. \"offensively we got a little better spacing,\" iguodala said of the team turning a corner. \"two shooters out there opens the court up for myself and lou williams penetrating. j.k. came in and got to his spot, i hit him and then he drew somebody that left someone else open. from there we just got a good flow. if you are a team that doesn't have a shooter out there they pack it in and you start second guessing yourself with open shots. you can shoot too many threes when you don't have good shooters, but when nocioni and kapono came out there it changed .\" turner made his second start of this preseason and he isn't shy in saying he hopes he can hold onto the spot. \"you get to warm up and then going from warm-ups to the starting lineup helps a lot and i also think you get a better feel for the rhythm of the game,\" the rookie explained of his preference to be on the floor for the opening tip. \"i am used to being out there. it is kind of hard to get used to (coming off the bench), but hopefully i keep playing well and it's the best situation and best for the team i think i might stay in the lineup .\" sixer fans, meet tiered pricing: philadelphia business journal for the opening night game oct. 27 against the miami heat, single-game tickets are priced at between $25 and $238, with the highest-priced tickets in six center-court, lower-level sections. for the team's second home game against the indiana pacers on nov. 3, and for all its other games except for the heat and lakers contests, the price range is $15 to $119. when the lakers visit in december, single game tickets are priced at between $25 and $139. 3. jrue holliday: he really looks like he could join the crop of <mark>young</mark> point guards that are changing the nba. with turner, holliday, and thaddeus young, you have 3 <mark>young</mark> guys on the court with some real basketball iq. 2. <mark>eddie jordan</mark> is not the coach: it bears repeating. completely un-sixer-related news of the day: gilbert fakes an injury when the washington post's <mark>michael lee</mark> and other reporters approached arenas after the game to ask about his sore knee that kept him out, he said he faked it to help get <mark>nick young</mark> some more playing time. \"i know he's kind of frustrated he's not getting a chance to crack the three position, especially since we're going three guards, so i told him i'd go ahead and fake an injury or say something's wrong with me so you can start,\" a smiling arenas said in the locker room. yahoo! sports says jrue holiday is a candidate to be a breakout fantasy player. speaking of, we...tragic end to a great story and the story that started it all for me nba coach power rankings: which head coaches are the best of an elite group?

newton, the team's top returning rusher from last season, has fallen behind monroe and fozzy whittaker on the depth chart while battling a hip pointer. <mark>brown</mark> said newton, a southlake carroll graduate, does not project to play much, if at all, in saturday's game at no. 5 nebraska (5-0, 1-0 big 12) that will determine if texas (3-2, 1-1) can snap its first two-game losing streak since the 2007 season. if not, the unranked longhorns will be afterthoughts in the big 12 title picture and owners of their first three-game losing streak since 1999. against that backdrop, expect the longhorns to do something in lincoln, neb., that they should have done sooner: build a game plan around quarterback garrett gilbert, a five-star signee with nfl-caliber arm strength, and downscale plans to jump-start a ground game that ranks 82nd nationally, at 129.8 yards per game. from the outset, <mark>brown</mark> has stressed that his off-season emphasis on an improved ground game--a failed bit, for multiple reasons--stemmed from a desire to minimize pressure on his first-year quarterback. now, coaches deem gilbert ready to shoulder more of the offensive load. \"we thought our offense would grow with garrett,\" <mark>brown</mark> said. \"we liked a lot of things he did in the second half against oklahoma .\" specifically, coaches liked the 208 passing yards and three scoring drives gilbert led during the second half of a 28-20 loss. during that stretch, he completed 17 of 26 passes and did not throw an interception. included were strikes of 44, 40 and 33 yards to different receivers. gilbert put up those numbers without throwing to the team's most electric receiver, <mark>mike davis</mark>, who missed the ou game with a knee ailment but is expected to play against nebraska. so is john chiles, a mansfield summit graduate who leads the team in yards per catch (15.4), but missed most of the ou game with a groin injury. after reviewing videotapes during the longhorns' bye week, offensive coordinator <mark>greg davis</mark> declared himself \"negligent\" of freeing gilbert to make big plays in the early stages of games because he focused too much on building his confidence with short completions. \"can we let him throw the ball vertically a little bit more?\" <mark>greg davis</mark> said. \"the answer is,\" yes .'...even if you don't hit those balls, it sends a message about vertical throws that may open up something underneath. early in games, we have not cut it loose as much as we should have. \"so, for the first time this season, all signs point to texas trying to win a game by leaning on its five-star quarterback instead of mixing in a liberal dose of carries for its three-star running backs. why have coaches been reluctant, until now, to put the ball in the hands of their most heralded offensive player? a combined 14 drops by receivers in the past three games is one answer. gilbert also has thrown more interceptions (five) than td passes (four) this season. but <mark>brown</mark> identified the biggest reason .\" there's no question that, until the trust between <mark>greg</mark> and garrett gets there, that it's harder to call plays, \"<mark>brown</mark> said .\" he's got to find out what garrett can do under pressure. \"<mark>brown</mark> said the two seemed to be\" really making progress \"during the bye week. gilbert said <mark>greg davis</mark> has spent the time since the ou game stressing a need to be more precise with the football and to look for more opportunities to scramble for first downs .\" there have been times when i've gotten out of the pocket and i maybe had 5 or 6 yards, \"gilbert said .\" but i tossed it downfield and the ball ended up falling incomplete. sometimes, the best play is to run and get what you can and either get down or get out of bounds. \"<mark>greg davis</mark> said gilbert's arm strength is a\" noticeable \"upgrade over predecessor colt mccoy. in terms of gilbert's mobility, <mark>davis</mark> said:\" we knew that he would not be a zone-read guy. but there are more plays in his feet than we've gotten through this part of the season. \"bottom line: with the team's season on the brink, texas coaches sound like they're finally ready to remove the offensive training wheels and sink or swim with gilbert. he clearly is receptive to the challenge.", "articleID": "2010101505_00273693_W", "names": {"Cody Johnson": ["Q17916913", "Q27052182"], "Greg Davis": ["Q16218420", "Q19872760", "Q3116205", "Q5605468", "Q5605470", "Q5605471", "Q5605474", "Q9276234"], "Mack Brown": ["Q13411875", "Q27830906"], "Mike Davis": ["Q14948795", "Q1608491", "Q16193543", "Q16235313", "Q16728420", "Q18631667", "Q1933136", "Q3313280", "Q6846501", "Q6846502", "Q6846504", "Q6846507", "Q6846508", "Q6846511", "Q6846512"]}}]
