stories of shooting his newest film the other end of the line, in mumbai. \"i think i will never forget my indian stay,\" he says, \"but if there is one thing that sticks up, \u00e2 it is an unscripted scene that director <mark>james dodson</mark> shot .\" the scene involved metcalfe racing through mumbai traffic. \"it was actually the mumbai traffic,\" he says, laughing. \"no roads were shut down to shoot the scene. we trusted our luck and shot it, and i am proud the way it came out .\" to the american popular media, jesse metcalfe is a \"shirtless beef,' as one fan magazine wrote. he is also known for the film <mark>john tucker</mark> must die, a modestly budgeted comedy, which went to earn about $40 million in north america. the film was a hit in many countries in europe, earning about $10 million from its british and german run alone. also read:\" excellent chemistry between jesse & shriya' this is the first time he is cast opposite\u00e2 an indian actress, shriya saran]. \u00e2 the other end of the line is a cross cultural love story produced by ashok amritraj and distributed in north america by mgm. it opens today in the us. the film focuses on an unlikely romance between a spunky indian call center operator (shriya) and an american customer (metcalfe) she falls in love without meeting him. ditching her indian fianc\u00ef \u00bf 1/2, and without telling him or her parents, she flies into san francisco and makes many discoveries, some pleasant, some disturbing and a few startling. \"my character in the film learns to connect the two cultures--american and indian,\" jesse says. \"i think i was able to do so in my own life. so i will always say that this film was a life-enhancing experience .\" the film created quite a bit of buzz not only for metcalfe but also shriya, who is featured in her first hollywood film. shriya, who has worked in 30 films in the last six years (including the rajnikanth-starrer sivaji: the boss), could not have asked for a bigger hollywood break than \"what makes the other end of the line a unique project for metcalfe is that he fell in love with his co-star, shriya saran,' wrote boxofficeprophets.com .\" that's right. one of the hottest actresses in bollywood is now hooking up with one of the hottest actors in hollywood, creating the possibility of some sort of ethnically diverse super-baby down the line .' \"everything that happened in this film was quite spontaneous,\" says metcalfe. \"we got along fabulously well with our indian co-artistes including anupam .\" ] plays shriya's nervous father, who follows her to san francisco along with his wife, hoping to persuade her to return to india to her fianc\u00ef \u00bf 1/2. metcalfe says he chose the film \"because every artist looks for a film to advance his or her career .' in an interview with an american magazine he said he doesn't miss his role as the gardener in desperate housewives. he acknowledges that it was a huge opportunity and he had a lot of fun .\" but leaving the show was a blessing because i could have still been playing <mark>john rowland</mark> five years later,' he had said. \"now, i've gotten to play some really interesting, complex characters in feature films .'\" i came back from mumbai having glimpsed an entirely new and vibrating culture, \"he said .\" i think i grew as a person spending several weeks shooting in mumbai. i got to know the city quite well.\u00e2 initially, like any other american tourist, i underwent a cultural shock. the city is densely populated. it has plenty of beauty and plenty of poverty. but i also realised soon that the poor people were trying to be resourceful and weren't taking their poverty for granted. and they had a sense of community. and many of them were trying to empower themselves. \"much of the film, including the hotel and restaurant scenes that take place in san francisco and new york, were shot in mumbai.", "articleID": "2008103119_00023854_W", "names":

my second favorite's magnum opus is set 300 years ago. spook country, by <mark>william gibson</mark>, is set in the present. or last year, anyway. neal stephenson hasn't published a book set in the future since 1995. it's been since 1999 for <mark>gibson</mark>. the new one, spook country, is one of the most enjoyable new reads i've had in a couple of years. <mark>gibson</mark> only puts out a book once every three or four years, so i've learned to take my time with his stuff. i spent about a week reading it, then immediately listened to the audio book, read by this guy robertson dean, who seems to be the pinnacle of evolution of a breed of human born specifically to read spook country out loud. there's a guy named milgrim who's hooked on prescription tranquilizers and must translate text messages in faux cyrillic for his captor, who may or may not be a federal agent. there's a cuban-chinese keyboard player kid who's been trained in the soviet martial art of systema. there's an ex rock star turned journalist working for a magazine that doesn't exist yet. none of that matters, because it's not the point. it's the world <mark>gibson</mark>'s describing that matters, the world of google and of wikipedia and 9-11 and pop culture, and the way he presents it, in these thoughtful and evocative two or three page chapters that mates art with gps, marketing and electronic espionage, slow motion and the cliffhanger. what does it mean, though? sci fi writers writing about the present and past. does it signify anything to you? to me, it speaks of a certain vision of the future arriving and while being familiar, doesn't resemble the predictions you've been expecting. <mark>gibson</mark>, in the documentary no maps for these territories, talks about those futures that didn't come to be, the \"future with a capital f, that was being planned, that the future was gonna happen because grownups were making decisions .\" that's paraphrased, but you get the point. the other future, is the future of pat frank's alas babylon that of the atomic apocalypse, where the world has come to an end. it seems that the future has arrived and the grown ups in charge aren't making great decisions, and the world hasn't ended in a firestorm yet. indeed, <mark>gibson</mark> says that the future may be unknowable, and perhaps that is the reason he examines our present so well. spook country is about family, outsourced spies, life after fame, and the sprint of technology into niche after niche, and it is fucking masterful. the present has never looked quite so shiny, gritty and cool. so the apocalypse didn't happen and we ain't getting jetpacks or teleporters. the next revolutions are happening so fast it's only barely possible to keep up with them in fiction, much less start making predictions, is that what's going on? <mark>gibson</mark> talks about things that \"up the ante\" for a sci fi writer, like, a \"when it was confirmed that <mark>michael jackson</mark> was gonna marry elvis presley's daughter, that\" truth is stranger than fiction' factor keeps getting jacked up on us on a fairly regular, maybe even exponential basis. and that's something that's peculiar to our time, i don't think our parents had to deal with that. \"it's funny,\" the present \"of <mark>gibson</mark>'s virtual light was almost three years ago and remains relevant, stephenson's cryptonomicon is set in 1999, and still has much to teach us about the need for data havens (can anyone say\" the pirate bay \"?) and crytopgraphy (which you had to use just to read this .). that future and that present are now past, and it seems our present will outpace us and may outpace our children. how you deal with it and your awareness of whatever portion of modernity you're feel like grasping seems to be what matters. we're not going to get to the shiny, polished future we imagined, and i think we all pretty much agreed on that when our petroleum wars began. it'll come at us from the past, which is stephenson's point in much of his latest work, and it'll come at us from like three days ago with some short article or a five second clip they didn't have enough time for on the news because they're busy revising the official story of our recent past.", "articleID": "2008110907_00009835_W", "names": {"Michael Jackson": ["Q2831", "Q3308266", "Q3856193", "Q43131943",

the release of 21 colleagues who police detained for protesting, state media reported. there were no taxis in service in sanya, a city on hainan island, on wednesday, and dozens of cab drivers were still gathered at the government headquarters, the official xinhua news agency reported. sanya's acting mayor <mark>wang yong</mark> met with representatives of taxi companies and drivers on tuesday and apologised to the drivers who are protesting against high rental fees and competition from unlicensed cabs, xinhua said .\" lots of issues exist in our transport management, and i apologise for that to the city's taxi drivers, \"he told them, according to xinhua. the strike began on monday, turning violent when some people smashed up 15 cabs and attacked other drivers who would not join them in the strike. police detained 21 of the drivers for the violence, xinhua reported, adding that the striking drivers had now added their release to the list of demands. it was the third strike action by taxi drivers in china in 10 days, after cabbies in the southwestern city of chongqing and in the northwestern province of gansu also stopped work in protest at high fees and unlicensed cabs. state media has said taxi companies have agreed to lower the chongqing drivers' fees for leasing their vehicles. the local government in gansu has also promised to get rid of unlicensed taxis, the official china daily reported wednesday. in sanya, <mark>wang</mark> pledged to improve the city's transport industry and create a favourable environment for licensed drivers, xinhua reported. he also expressed support for the establishment of a cabbies' association, which is one of the other demands of the striking drivers, the news agency said. copyright \u00a9 mediacorp pte ltd. all rights

we shouldn't \"soft-pedal\" our attacks on barack obama, \"just because the president of the united states happens to be a black man .\" this, of course, presents the argument that <mark>steele</mark> - an african-american - could be a more effective critic of obama than could his white republican colleagues. he added that \"the obama campaign played the race card beautifully .\" david harsanyi says he was more explicit than that: the most interesting aspect of the call focused on the perceived ability of <mark>steele</mark> to take on barack obama more ferociously and avoid the tedious race-card ploy used by some democrats. when asked if he would be able to criticize obama more freely, <mark>steele</mark> said \"i think because i'm an american i will be to do it\" and that \"bad policies don't have color, they're just bad policies .\" good answers. having him up top could reduce the absolute moral authority deficit superficially, but will it really \"avoid the tedious race-card ploy\" ? remember, this is a guy whom the nutroots have been known to photoshop as sambo for the crime of being black while conservative. if anything, i suspect, electing him will feed racial politics by leading the left to frame the one as \"authentically black\" vis-a-vis the republican \"house slave\" or whatever progressive witticism they've coined for him this month. which isn't a reason to vote against <mark>steele</mark>, needless to say: on the contrary, maybe that's the point - to bait them and let them show off how \"enlightened\" they really are. they won't be able to resist. don't get your hopes up: but one influential republican believes that rnc members are going to insist that the next chair come from the rnc. \"as to the new chair, don't pay any attention to people who aren't on the rnc,\" he told me. \"this is not a good thing, but the current rnc believes only one of their own should be chair. maybe a dozen have a clue politically - and that's being very kind. none (as chairman) could be an ideas leader or command the substantive respect of republican senators or representatives .\" if that's true, if <mark>steele</mark>'s doomed to lose to some rnc crony, it's doubly unfortunate insofar as not only will the base be disappointed, but it'll hand the democrats an easy talking point about the prospects for black politicians within the gop as compared to their own party. not just for that reason but partly for that reason, i hope he pulls it out. note from hot air management: this section is for comments from hot air's community

post staff writer sunday, november 16, 2008; 11:19 pm redskins notebook: calf injury sidelines springs for fourth straight game campbell and moss, however, have not experienced that type of success recently--and neither have the redskins. the duo failed to connect on a fourth-down pass, dallas took possession with 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining in the game and ran out the clock in a 14-10 victory in front of 90,830. \"this is an nfc east game,\" washington cornerback fred smoot said. \"they gutted it out at the end, and we didn't make they plays when it mattered. they threw a punch, we threw a punch; they threw the last punch, and it knocked us out .\" the cowboys took the lead with 10:36 left to play on quarterback tony romo's 25-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end martellus bennett, who beat rookie strong safety <mark>chris horton</mark> off the line of scrimmage and made a nifty catch in the end zone while absorbing a hit from free safety laron landry. romo, who returned to the lineup after missing three games because of a pinky injury, threw two interceptions in the first half but led the cowboys (6-4) as they rallied past the redskins (6-4) in a matchup of nfc east rivals. romo completed 19 of 27 passes for 198 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions, his return providing a boost for the cowboys in what their players described as a must-win game. the redskins have now dropped two in a row. campbell finished 22 of 34 with 162 yards and one touchdown and one interception. running back clinton portis, playing with a sprained left knee, ran for 68 yards on 15 carries. \"we're 6-4, a lot of teams are 6-4,\" portis said. \"it's gonna come down to the end .\" neither team could establish a consistent rhythm on offense in a scoreless third quarter. the redskins began the second half with a three-point lead and the ball. starting at their 13, the redskins ran 12 plays in advancing to the cowboys' 35-yard line. but on third down, with campbell looking for moss along the right sideline, dallas cornerback terence newman got between moss and the ball and came up with an interception. in the redskins' previous game--a 23-6 loss to the pittsburgh steelers on nov. 3--campbell threw his first interception of the season in the third quarter, ending washington's nfl-record streak of games without an interception at 12, spanning 379 consecutive pass attempts. the interception was campbell's first in 271 straight attempts, which established a team record. he was picked off by the steelers a second time on washington's final offensive play. romo threw two first-half interceptions as he struggled against the nfl's fourth-ranked defense. with the cowboys at washington's 27-yard line in the first quarter, recently acquired pro bowl cornerback deangelo hall, in coverage against owens, intercepted a poorly thrown pass by romo. at washington's 25-yard line in the second quarter, romo completed a short pass in the middle of the field to owens, but the ball popped out of owens's hands when <mark>carlos rogers</mark> delivered a big hit and weak-side linebacker grabbed it for his first career interception. portis impressed as the redskins scored the game's first touchdown in the first quarter on a short touchdown pass from campbell to sellers. dallas tied the score at 7 on barber's two-yard touchdown run with 1:06 left in the half. romo had 28 - and 25-yard completions to tight end jason witten and owens, respectively, on consecutive plays to help dallas drive 80 yards on seven plays in 3:40. and then dallas did a poor job on its kickoff return coverage, and cartwright seized produced a 58-yard kickoff return. five plays later, suisham kicked a 41-yard field goal. \"it was really good,\" zorn said of cartwright's timely return. \"that is our special teams. we just need more of that. we talked during the week about how all three phases needed to be a part of the win, if we were going to win .\" increased fan support, in part, might have aided the redskins in their fast start. after pittsburgh fans seemed to take over fedex--waving gold-and-black terrible towels from start to finish--during the steelers' victory in week 9, players expressed disappointment and frustration about the situation. in fact, steelers fans were so vocal that the redskins had to use a silent count at times because of the crowd noise. presumably in response to that display, radio station espn 980, an outlet washington owner daniel snyder purchased in june, gave away 50,000 \"rally rags\" emblazoned with the redskins' colors and logo. redskins supporters then did their part, waving the towels in an impressive showing before kickoff and at other key moments throughout the game. portis provided the night's first stirring moment, carrying the united states flag as he ran onto the field during pregame introductions. there was a buzz in stadium about two hours before game time as portis, under the supervision of larry hess, director rehabilitation, tested his knee on the field. for about 15 minutes, portis cut sharply, sprinted and ran through others drills in an effort to determine whether he could play. for someone who had not practiced all week because of a sprained medial collateral ligament, portis appeared to move well. after the session, portis, hess, zorn, offensive coordinator <mark>sherman smith</mark>, director of sports medicine bubba tyer and head athletic trainer john burrell met on the field and discussed the situation. portis told the group he could give it a go, and they agreed to let him try. washington quickly benefited from the move as portis played a key role in helping the team take a 7-0 lead. after the cowboys went three and out on the game's opening possession, the redskins traveled 49 yards on 10 plays, the last two yards on campbell's touchdown pass to sellers to the right side. on the drive, portis rushed five times for 29 yards. he gained five yards on his first carry to reach 1,000 yards rushing for the season in his 10th game--the fewest games he has needed to accomplish the feat in his career. with the redskins needing a yard on fourth down at dallas's 11-yard line, portis, who has rushed for at least 1,000 yards six times in his seven-year career, gained nine yards. on the next play, sellers and campbell connected for the touchdown. redskins insider jason la canfora provides exlusive analysis of the redskins.", "articleID": "2008111705_00000238_W", "names": {"Carlos Rogers": ["Q1627398", "Q3660129"], "Chris Horton":
