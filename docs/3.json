Pivotal already has a thriving ecosystem, but the systems integrators deploying its distribution of the cloud-based development platform have thus far engaged with the company at only an opportunistic, ad hoc level, Nick Cayou, Pivotal's vice president of global alliances, said Tuesday. The Pivotal Ready Partner Program will help partners jointly develop their businesses with Pivotal and more clearly convey their expertise to customers and other members of the open-source community, Cayou told CRN. [Related: Where Will Ford's Investment In Pivotal Drive The Software Company's Channel?] \"As we've crystallized our product strategy, namely around Cloud Foundry, what we've found is in order to go to market effectively we need a really robust ecosystem of systems integrators,\" Cayou told CRN. The program launches with 29 inaugural partners--less than half the total number of integrators that currently deploy the platform to customers. With two tiers--Registered and Advanced--the program has some traditional elements. But the open-source nature of the San Francisco-based company's flagship product also spawns unique relationships with partners. Since Pivotal turned over the platform to the Cloud Foundry Foundation roughly two years ago, almost 70 companies have contributed code to the open-source project, Cayou said. Some of those contributors are traditional technology vendors, including IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise; others are primarily implementers that partner with Pivotal. Having partners that are also co-developers shakes up channel dynamics, Cayou said, as does Pivotal's practice of inverting the typical go-to-market order by frequently engaging directly with line-of-business leaders for its largest customers, then pulling partners into those enterprise deals. <mark>Mark Carlson</mark>, CTO of ECS Team, a solution provider based in Denver, told CRN that joining a formal Pivotal program will help ECS represent its Cloud Foundry credentials to an expanding ecosystem and customer base.

The Peaky Blinders star was given permission to build a two-storey extension at his large Georgian home in 2013. But last year a local tipped off the council, claiming the actor's application only allowed him to use clad tiling - but he had put up white-oiled Siberian larch timber finish instead. <mark>Hardy</mark>'s planning agent was forced to submit a retrospective application to keep the extension as it is - and the proposal was accepted by the council. The decision by Richmond Council last month means <mark>Hardy</mark> won't have to take down the cladding on his five-bed home. Outlining their decision, a planner at London Borough of Richmond Council said the plans would not \"detract from the wider street scene.\" The 41-year-old was given the go-ahead to demolish a single-storey side extension and build a two-storey replacement in 2013. It was alleged he had not stuck to the exact details of his granted application, by using different materials on his home, according to planning documents. The council also discovered a window been moved from the right to the left of the extension, documents said. His alleged mistake apparently went unnoticed for five years, until someone informed the council, who contacted the actor, letters claim. Council workers said in the planning documents that he could either tear down the larch or submit a new application. . <mark>Hardy</mark>'s agent resubmitted the plans in October 2018 asking to keep the wood. A representative for his agents Howard Sharp and Partners LLP said when it was built, <mark>Hardy</mark> was \"very keen to ensure a high quality material\" was used. They said the white oiled Siberian Larch timber was chosen because it \"was seen by the applicants to positively respond to the overall contemporary design of the extension.\" They said the window was

the building in shanghai's historic bund district where aig founder c.v. starr first established the insurance company in 1919. pedestrians walk past the building in shanghai's historic bund district where aig founder c.v. starr first established the insurance company in 1919. the company has deep roots in china, where some customers are canceling their policies. by <mark>don lee</mark>, los angeles times staff writer september 24, 2008 shanghai--aig's roots go deep here, all the way back to 1919 when a young and restless californian arrived in a booming semi-colonial city that was teeming with bankers, industrialists and opium merchants. cornelius vander starr had sold auto insurance in san francisco before serving as an infantry sergeant during the great war. but the fort bragg native wasn't commissioned overseas, so when the war ended, he ventured off by himself to asia's commercial hub at age 26. before long, he opened an office on nanking road with two chinese clerks, underwriting ordinary life insurance policies as well as coverage for cargo ships carrying refugees from russia's vladivostok to europe. and so was born the company that would become american international group inc., the biggest insurance firm in the world. since then, aig has had a special place in the hearts of many chinese, who regarded the company as among the best of international brands. but after the u.s. government's $85-billion rescue of the troubled conglomerate last week, its stellar reputation has been tarnished, and at least a few customers are canceling their policies. \"it probably won't have any problems, but i don't know. i just don't feel comfortable leaving it there,\" said <mark>wang qiang</mark>, 54, an administrator for a construction company who rushed to aig's branch in the southern city of guangzhou as soon as he learned about the government's intervention. despite aig's assurances that its customers were protected, <mark>wang</mark> didn't hesitate to cash out his $12,000 whole life policy. like <mark>wang</mark>, most chinese understand little of the turmoil that has engulfed aig and caused it to lose $18 billion over the last three quarters--primarily from its extensive exposure to the tottering u.s. housing and mortgage industries. but its stunning fall has hardly gone unnoticed here, illustrating the global ripple effects of the american financial crisis. aig has 3.7 million customers in china, according to an analyst's estimate, and millions more elsewhere in asia--a legacy of starr's aggressive expansion in the region in the 1920s. about half of aig's global workforce of 116,000 is in asia. the new york-based company manages $115 billion in assets in asia and has tens of billions invested in roads and development projects from the philippines to south korea. aig's operations in mainland china are more limited, mainly life, property and casualty insurance lines, reflecting the nation's tight restrictions on foreign financial service firms. aig spokespersons in china would not comment on how many customers had canceled policies in recent days, although interviews with aig salespeople and policyholders suggest the numbers are small. on tuesday, the company said it had completed the deal under which the u.s. government would lend aig as much as $85 billion for roughly 80% of the company. the insurance giant is expected to sell assets to repay the federal loan. analysts and former china executives of aig believe the corporation will hold on to aig's businesses in china, given the future potential. overall, income from insurance premiums totaled about $100 billion last year, more than double the amount in 2002, according to government figures. only about a fifth of china's 1.3 billion citizens have insurance policies, mostly in urban areas. aig's life insurance company, called aia in china, generated about $115 million in premium income last year, up 19.5% from 2006, according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers. aig's property & casualty line in china has grown by an average of 25% annually in the last 15 years, said david peng, a former board director of aig's property and casualty company in china. \"they may sell the most valuable assets to get cash, but that's not good for aig in the long run,\" said peng, a 13-year veteran who last month resigned to build a brokerage in beijing. he described aig's international operations, including those in china, as the \"most beautiful\" of all the corporation's holdings. \"aig can be back to where it all started,\" he said. \"they're good at international markets.\" although aig is tiny in china compared with domestic players, it ranks no. 1 in almost all categories of insurance products among foreign firms in china. that's in no small part because of its long connections to the country. stories abound of starr's affection for china and his chinese employees. in 1945, shortly after v-j day, starr chartered a plane for shanghai, bringing with him a suitcase full of dollars to go back into business, according to an official biography of starr. when the communists came to power in 1949, starr closed aig's operations in china, moving the base to new york. in 1967, a year before his death, starr passed the baton to his protege, maurice \"hank\" greenberg. greenberg made frequent trips to china, endearing himself to government officials by helping fund a children's hospital in shanghai. in another grand gesture, he paid a paris antiques dealer $5 million for 10 copper windows that had been removed from beijing's summer palace and gave them to china as a gift. in 1992, aig became the first foreign insurer allowed to do business in contemporary china. \"no other insurance company can compare the kinship aig has with china,\" said <mark>zheng wei</mark>, vice chairman of the department of risk management and insurance at peking university. more recently, he said, \"customers believed that even if aig's shanghai branch or guangzhou branch had problems, it still had a strong headquarters in the u.s. to back it up. but right now, the financial situation of its headquarters has become aig china's biggest challenge.\" <mark>cao jun</mark> in the times' shanghai bureau contributed to this report. opinion l.a. the best in southern california opinion journalism tue, september 23, 2008 |

"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/don-henley-building-the-perfect-beast", "content": "30 Years Ago: Don Henley Gets Confident, Builds a Near-Perfect \"Beast' Don Henley's solo debut, 1982 \u2032 s' I Can't Stand Still,' performed respectably on the charts, peaking at No. 24 and selling more than half a million copies. Compared to the commercial heights he'd reached as a member of the Eagles, however, that was small potatoes - and a far from definitive statement for a singer-songwriter seeking to define himself as an artist in his own right. He took a big step forward with his second effort,\" Building the Perfect Beast .' Released Nov. 19, 1984, the 10-song effort found Henley moving his sound further into the '80s - with all the synths and drum programs that entailed - while doubling down on the staunchly progressive social consciousness that informed' I Can't Stand Still' and deepening the pointed observations on human relationships that had always defined his best work. To some, the album's crowded, machine-assisted arrangements may have sounded like an attempt to glom onto current trends; to Henley, however, they were of a piece with his earlier work. \"I'm not ashamed of having been in the Eagles. I think we accomplished a great deal and added some pretty good music to the annals of rock n' roll,\" Henley told Record. \"The songs I'm writing now are simply extensions of songs I wrote then. They're more mature, succinct versions of those songs. I still am basically the same guy and I feel the same way about certain things; I've matured a great deal about other things, such as male/female relationships.\" As he had on his debut solo album, Henley worked closely with former <mark>James Taylor</mark> bandmate Danny Kortchmar, who'd made a name for himself as a producer and co-writer with many of the artists in Henley's peer group. By the time they hunkered down in the studio for the two-year process of writing and recording \"Building the Perfect Beast,' Henley and Kortchmar - a.k.a.\" Kootch' - had developed a level of trust and communication that allowed Henley the opportunity to take new risks. \"Songwriting is not quite as intimate a process as it used to be,\" Henley admitted during an interview with In the Studio. \"Sometimes nowadays - and I don't know if this is good or bad, but it seems to work - Danny will simply deliver me a cassette with a musical track on it and I'll just take it home and write it by myself, either in the car or at my house. I'll just play the music, and I can tell in the first couple of minutes if I can write a song - if it will pull a concept out of me. I have a bank of ideas in my head that I want to talk about, and I can either overlay that onto a piece of music or I can't.\" As he had on' I Can't Stand Still,' Henley employed a long list of session ringers for the \"Beast' tracks, enlisting liner notes mainstays like bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Jim Keltner as well as musicians who were recording artists in their own right, including Toto. But he also set about building the perfect solo band, with an eye toward upping his game when it came time to take the new songs on the road.\" I wanted some new, fresh people, so I just went out looking for them, I went to clubs all over town, \"Henley said of the arduous process of putting together new personnel.\" The word-of-mouth got around and we started getting volunteers. I held auditions for three or four weeks; I must have gone through God knows how many guitar players. It was excruciating. \"But, he pointed out, it paid off in terms of allowing Henley to surround himself with what he deemed a superior class of musician than the one he'd been accustomed to with the Eagles - particularly in terms of offstage behavior.\" I'm not a priest or anything, but I don't believe in making public spectacles, especially if you're in a rock 'n' roll band in a public place. We have a bad enough reputation in rock 'n' roll as it is, \"he shrugged.\" The whole rock musician as outlaw thing seems pretty immature and hokey to me now. \"Not only was Henley more concerned with keeping things on the up-and-up in his hotel rooms, he'd come around to a different way of thinking as far as stage presentation went for his solo tours.\" This is the Eighties: you dress up now, you have lights. It's showbiz now. It's not the Seventies and the Sixties anymore; it's completely different, \"he argued.\" I went to a lot of concerts in the past couple of years. I went to see the Eurythmics several times, and <mark>Paul Young</mark>, Tina Turner, a bunch of concerts. You don't go out in blue jeans and loiter anymore. \"He was also more aggressive about lining up guest appearances from famous friends and strangers, including Patty Smyth of Scandal, Tom Petty's longtime lieutenant <mark>Mike Campbell</mark> - the latter of whom ended up co-writing the record's biggest hit,\" The Boys of Summer .' \"I have a lot of nerve. I'll call anybody,\" he laughed. \"I was afraid some of those people were not going to be into an old guy from the mellow Seventies, you know? And Patty said,\" Are you kidding?' I used to sing \"Witchy Woman' when I was 15!'\" That all reflected Henley's increased confidence in himself as a solo performer - something he insisted developed slowly after the Eagles fell apart. \"I said,\" God, can I do this by myself?' I thought maybe I should put another band together. Then I said, \"Nah, I can do this .' I drank a lot of Scotch making that first album,\" he admitted. \"And then after it was done I figured,\" Yeah, I can do this,' so this album was much more confident. It sounds more confident, I think, and I stretched further and took more chances. \"Those chances paid off handsomely after\" Building the Perfect Beast' arrived in stores. A Top 20, triple-platinum hit, the album spun off a string of big singles, including four Top 40 pop hits: \"The Boys of Summer' (No. 5),\" All She Wants to Do Is Dance' (No. 9), \"Not Enough Love in the World' (No. 34), and\" Sunset Grill' (No. 22). More impressively, Henley's pop crossover act - which included heavy rotation on adult contemporary and dance playlists - didn't hurt his stature on rock radio, where five of the album's tracks went Top 20 (and \"The Boys of Summer' and\" All She Wants to Do Is Dance' hit No. 1).

The city with a population of more than half a million adults has 55,000 people who have never worked. Glasgow's rate, which is 11.1%, is not far away from double the Scottish figure of 6.7% who have never worked. The report covers over 16s but excludes those up to the age of 24 who are in full time education at school, college or university. The number of lifetime jobless in the city has increased in the last decade from 27,400 in 2005 but is a fall from the highest figure of 63,000 in 2012. Only Dundee has a similar rate at 11.2% with just under 14,000 in the same situation. Glasgow is home to tens of thousands of people who are on long term sickness benefit and may be one reason for the higher number of lifetime jobless in the city. Last year there were 111,700 economically inactive adults of working age in the city, including, students, those who retired but not yet of state pensionable age, long term sick and people looking after a relative. Almost 35,000 were long term sick, and 19,000 were looking after someone. There were 36,000 students and 8,000 retired and 9000 classed as other. The lifetime jobless also include young people not in education or training so includes some teenagers looking for their first job after leaving education which only accounts for around two to three thousands a year. In 2014 there were 2270 teenagers aged 16-19, not in education or training (Neet) the lowest in a decade and down almost 1000 from 2005. <mark>Keith Brown</mark> the new Economy Secretary said the picture for young people was improving. He said: \"We are seeing encouraging progress with more young people finding work across most of Scotland, with the youth employment rate increasing by three percentage points last year.\" Within the first 100 days of this Scottish Government we will build on the progress we have made with a new Labour market strategy to focus our efforts and target a further reduction in youth unemployment. \"The Scottish economy has a number of fundamental strengths that will be crucial for the future. Increased inward investment, combined with a resilient labour market and talented workforce, is positive news for our jobs market and our economy as whole.\" The Tories however warned that across Scotland the number of Neets was increasing and linked it to college cuts. Murdo Fraser, conservative finance spokesman said: \"These statistics should focus minds within the Scottish Government.\" The UK Government has worked very hard to ensure economic recovery, and we can't have young people in Scotland missing out on that because the SNP doesn't value college education. \"Share: 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2017122407_00070788_W", "names": {"Karl Hofmann": ["Q1668724", "Q21544598"]}, "date": "2017-12-24", "url": "https://www.abqjournal.com/1110312/installation-offers-artist-opportunity-to-engage-with-the-street.html", "content": "............................................................................................................ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.--Ribbons and wisps of wood orbit and spiral around upside-down sawhorses like some kind of warped helix.

But a closer look exposes deliberate patterns of shape and light amid the cacophony of chaos.

The Albuquerque artist's installation \"In the Balance\" snakes, swirls and climbs across the windows, above the door and inside the main gallery at 516 Arts. Created from plywood, poplar, plastic and metal, the creation mirrors the imbalance of the world today, <mark>Hofmann</mark> said. Organizers chose <mark>Hofmann</mark>'s playful piece out of about 15 submissions, 516 curator Josie Lopez said. \"We were really interested in artists who were able and willing to engage with that front window space,\" she said. \"We also saw it as an opportunity to engage with the street. You actually walk through the art as you enter the space. It makes it exciting in that you get different perspectives.\" <mark>Hofmann</mark> moved to Albuquerque from New Orleans to complete his master in fine arts degree at the University of New Mexico. His work is a hybrid of pop, dada and expressionism combining the organic geometry of Kandinsky with Marcel Duchamp's \"ready-made\" found objects. \"In the Balance\" mixes two-by-fours with soaring ribbons of poplar joined with metal and plastic clamps. A silver trash can hugs a bouquet of plywood stems. \"The idea is to create an aesthetic spectacle out of commonplace materials,\" <mark>Hofmann</mark> said. \"All of this stuff has its own visual language. It adds tension to the space. If I take the clamps off, the whole piece will collapse.\" Lifting materials from big-box hardware stores came easily to an artist who built his own stretchers and rehabilitated his own \"faux adobe.\" Advertisement Continue reading \"You start seeing these patterns of wood---- the psychedelic patterns of plywood when they're juxtaposed in a pile,\" he said. \"There's beauty in that.\" It was almost like playing with Legos. It came naturally and intuitively. \"The title springs from a world <mark>Hofmann</mark> sees as teetering toward imbalance.\" I'm balancing things in place, especially with these poplar ribbons, \"he said, gazing overhead at the undulating ribbons of wood.\" Then you start joining and connecting them. In my work, I'm always balancing to create and order, which is part of the sense I have of the world I live in. I think it is a direct reaction to all the uncertainty in the world. It gives me a sense of calm. \"<mark>Hofmann</mark> was an artist in residence at China's DaWang Culture Highland and is the recipient of the Arnold W.

While playing coy with his lineup on the whole, manager <mark>John Farrell</mark> at least announced that <mark>Ortiz</mark> would get the starting nod over Mike Napoli at first base at Citizens Bank Park. Although <mark>Ortiz</mark> took ground balls at first throughout the spring, he didn't play in an actual spring training game there.\" One of the disadvantages that we have coming into a National League ballpark is we're built as an American League club, and two of our primary power hitters occupy that same position, \"<mark>Farrell</mark> said.\" Mike has had a very good spring training. He's certainly available to us. Both guys will play a significant role in this series. \"Napoli slugged six home runs this spring. <mark>Farrell</mark> didn't specify on how he'd split the playing time between the two players on Wednesday and Thursday in Philadelphia. The manager did say there would be some shuffling in the middle of his lineup against the lefty Hamels. The Red Sox featured a consistent lineup in the spring against right-handers; <mark>Farrell</mark> said Pablo Sandoval could be dropped lower against southpaws.\" We might adjust accordingly, especially in the middle of the lineup, \"<mark>Farrell</mark> said. For most of the season, that probably means Napoli moving to fifth against lefties. On Monday with Napoli on the bench, perhaps it means Shane Victorino sneaks up a spot.
