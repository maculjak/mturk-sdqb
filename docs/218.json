But what's underneath is a musical treat for the brave who dare look under the cover. In an attempt to make downtown Raleigh a little bit more fun, the city placed a piano along Fayetteville Street on Friday afternoon. The hope is that it will stay there for at least a few months and that passersby will play a tune or stop to listen. \"It's a toy,\" said Jen Baker, the city's downtown coordinator. \"I hate to refer to a great musical instrument like that as a toy, but it's really just for fun. SIGN UP\" It's just another opportunity to interact, \"Baker said.\" It's not social media. It's real life. And it's one more way to enjoy downtown Raleigh. \"Before city staff could load the piano stool off the truck, Kristeena Yates started to play. She'd just finished her shift at nearby Jimmy John's and one of her coworkers watched behind her. Yates also plays the guitar, and she insists she only dabbles with the piano.\" There is a piano up here, \"<mark>Earl Jones</mark> said as he walked along the street. <mark>Jones</mark> plays guitar, bass and keyboard and sometimes performs downtown for free. He'd like to make some money, he said, but he wasn't willing to pay the city for a busking permit.\" I think it's cool, \"he said of the piano.\" It'd be great if people want to play the piano and bring a guitar and bass out here. \"Raleigh bought two pianos from the Habitat for Humanity ReStore for $175. While one is on Fayetteville Street, the other will be painted by the Glenwood South Neighborhood Collaborative and placed in that part of downtown. Anyone who wants to donate more musical instruments for downtown can use the social media hashtag #TeamDowntownRaleigh or email teamdowntownraleigh @ raleighnc.gov."}, {"articleID":

politicians win fight for hammar to come home a marine veteran jailed for months in mexico after trying to carry a family heirloom shotgun across the border has been freed, u.s. officials, his lawyer and family said late friday. shortly after 9:30 p.m., hammar's mother, olivia, received a personal email from a u.s. official who reported that he has crossed the border and was in the united states. \"jon is in u.s. territory. god bless america,\" olivia said through tears. the hammar family said they are unsure about their travel plans. because of hammar's post-traumatic stress disorder, the family will not release the details of their flight home. they are currently in texas and are not sure if they will return to south florida friday night. \"i'm going to be cooking all weekend for him. everything he's ever enjoyed eating i will be cooking this weekend,\" said olivia. \"we're just grateful people. this christmas--we'll never forget it.\" the attorney for 27-year-old jon hammar tweeted friday night that his client had been released from a detention center in matamoros, mexico. patrick ventrell, the acting deputy spokesman for the state department, confirmed hammer's release and return to the u.s. in a statement friday night. \"officials from the u.s. consulate general in matamoros met him at the prison and escorted him to the u.s. border, where he was reunited with members of his family,\" the statement said. \"we sincerely appreciate the efforts on the part of mexican authorities to ensure that an appropriate resolution was made in accordance with mexican law, and that mr. hammar will be free to spend the holidays with his loved ones.\" an aide to a legal representative of the mexican attorney general's office had told u.s. sen. <mark>bill nelson</mark>'s staff about the pending release after the florida democrat's office got word from hammar's mother, according to a press release from <mark>nelson</mark>'s office. \"no american should be in a mexican jail for five months without being able to have his case in front of a judge,\" <mark>nelson</mark> said in that statement. \"we're grateful; this is a good christmas present.\" earlier friday, varon levy said he was flying from mexico city to matamoros to pick up his client. after that, the attorney said, they intended to cross the border at brownsville, texas. \"i'm very happy. i feel that the mexican legal system came out the way it should have,\" he said. u.s. immigration and state department officials had been at the mexican detention center waiting for hammar's release. a defense lawyer said mexican authorities determined there was no intent to commit a crime, <mark>nelson</mark>'s office said. the senator was among a handful of elected officials who urged the state department to help get hammar out of mexico. his family had said he was being held in isolation after threats to his safety were received. \"these past few months have been an absolute nightmare for jon and his family, and i am so relieved that this whole ordeal will soon be over,\" said u.s. rep. ileana ros-lehtinen, r-fla., in a statement. \"i am overcome with joy knowing that jon will be spending christmas with his parents, family and friends.\" the attorney, varon levy, said the path for hammar's return was cleared when mexican officials decided not to appeal the judge's ruling. civilian gun ownership is illegal under mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special shop run by the country's department of defense. \"the department of state warns all u.s. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into mexico,\" the u.s. embassy in mexico writes on its website. \"entering mexico with a firearm, certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into mexico unintentionally.\" mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. the family said hammar's shotgun has a barrel of 24 inches. tourists are allowed to bring guns for hunting on rare occasions, but mexican officials said all visitors must receive a special permit before entering the country. mexican customs agents do not issue gun permits. as a result, anyone crossing the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued government permit is in instant violation of mexican law, which stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws. hammar and his friend were on their way to costa rica in august and planned to drive across the mexican border near matamoros in a winnebago filled with surfboards and camping gear. hammar asked u.s. border agents what to do with the unloaded shotgun. his family said agents told them to fill out a form for the gun, which belonged to hammar's great-grandfather. but when the pair crossed the border and handed the paperwork to mexican officials, they impounded the rv and jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun before hammar's release, varon levy said he was not sure of his client's immediate plans upon being freed. \"probably some down time,\" he said. copyright 2012 by post newsweek. all rights

been ruled out of their next World Cup match against Pakistan with a side strain, captain Aaron Finch said on Tuesday. Stoinis, who has played in all three games for Australia in the tournament, picked up the injury in the match against India at The Oval on Sunday. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh has been flown over to England as back-up, but the Australians will wait to make a call on whether he permanently replaces Stoinis in their 15-man squad. \"Marcus Stoinis has a bit of a side strain. He won't be available for tomorrow,\" Finch told a news conference ahead of Wednesday's match against Pakistan in Taunton. \"We've got Mitch Marsh flying over just as a bit of a precaution.

Australia's pace duo Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins found their rhythm early against India but the supporting cast of leg-spinner Adam Zampa and seamers Stoinis and Nathan Coulter-Nile struggled to keep it tight in the middle overs.

With an opportunity to win a back-and-forth match, the Crescenta Valley High freshman girls' lacrosse player studied the opposing goalkeeper before launching an eight-meter shot. Hales scored with 2:23 left in double-overtime to lift visiting Crescenta Valley to a 9-8 nonleague win against Westridge on Wednesday. \"I wanted to score by shooting through the goalkeeper's legs,\" said Hales, a midfielder who finished with two goals. \"I was thinking to myself that I had to make the shot or else we keep on playing.\" It turned out to be a nerve-wracking game that we were able to win. I'm just going out there trying to live up to my expectations. You put it all on the line and I love the sport. \"It marked the second time this season that Hales scored on an eight-meter shot. Crescenta Valley (8-4) defeated Westridge (7-6) for the second time this season. The Falcons picked up a 7-4 home win in the first meeting April 6. Crescenta Valley finished second in the Pacific League behind Chaminade after tying for third with La Ca & ntilde; ada last season. The Falcons qualified for the USA Lacrosse Southern Section North Division playoffs. Playoff pairings are set to be unveiled Sunday. However, Crowther said he would make a decision as to whether the Falcons will participate in the postseason since several players have Advanced Placement testing that could conflict. The Falcons and Tigers have had a brief history of playing overtime matches. The teams played two overtime tilts last season.\" It's an exciting game, except for me as the coach, \"Crescenta Valley Coach Boz Crowther said.\" We seem to be on paper a marginally better team than Westridge. When we play Westridge, you can throw away the paper because we always seem to go to overtime against them. \"We train our players to watch the tendencies of the goalkeeper. Lizzy saw something to her liking and made a nice shot to win it.\" The Falcons, who finished second in the Pacific League behind Chaminade after tying for third last season with La Ca & ntilde; ada, tied it at 8 on a goal by Madeline Heeg with 7:54 left in the second half. Heeg's goal came a little more than five minutes after Rachel Dillman gave the Tigers an 8-7 lead. Crescenta Valley held a 7-5 halftime advantage. Abby Sheklow scored two goals in a 50-second span late in the first half. Sheklow, a junior attacker, finished with a team-high three goals. \"We went up against a Westridge team that worked so hard,\" Sheklow said. \"They played a great game.\" We wanted it so much in the end. Lizzy made a great shot to win it and we're so proud of her. There's a lot of skill on our team and we are trying to get better. \"Crescenta Valley received 10 saves from goalkeeper <mark>Sabrina White</mark>, including two in the first overtime. Dillman and Quincy Foster had two goals each for Westridge. Dillman's first goal gave the Tigers a 2-0 lead with 23:34 left in the first half. Sheklow knotted it at 3 with 8:49 to go.
