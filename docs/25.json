school marching band practice in preparation for monday's memorial day parade's performance. ryan hansen, a seventh-grade teacher at the school and the vfw state teacher of the year, will serve as grand marshal. macomb county residents will kick off the informal start of summer this memorial day weekend with near-perfect weather and holiday parades in six local communities. temperatures were in the 80s on thursday, but more normal late may weather is expected for the weekend with the thermometer hitting the mid - to upper-70 degree range today through monday, according to the national weather service. \"it looks like we're in store for a very pleasant weekend weather-wise with the only chance for precipitation coming on saturday,\" said meteorologist <mark>karen clark</mark>. the good weather is good news for area boaters - at least those who can still afford to put their vessels in the water - as the boating season starts. the macomb county sheriff's marine patrol and u.s. coast guard are ready to monitor the waterways. \"this is the kickoff weekend for many boaters and with the nice weekend coming up, i'm sure there's going to be quite a few people out on lake st. clair,\" said macomb county sheriff mark hackel. thousands of local residents are expected to turn out for the six local memorial day parades and activities lined up to salute the sacrifice of military veterans who died or were injured while protecting the interests of the united states. the cousino high school marching band in warren will perform at the memorial day parade in washington, d.c., on the national mall. band director jeff cutter said 53 students and 10 adults will spend the weekend touring the sites in the u.s. capitol. \"everyone is excited to go,\" cutter said. \"it's a huge honor for us. we have quite a busy schedule of things to do, but the parade will be the last thing on the list on monday before we leave for home .\" in eastpointe, michigan lt. gov. <mark>john cherry</mark> will join congressman sander levin and local elected officials beginning at 11 a.m. monday along the parade route down gratiot to stephens and ending with a program at kennedy park, where newly elected 38th district court judge carl gerds will be the guest speaker. other parades are scheduled for new baltimore, romeo, roseville and sterling heights, all starting at 10 a.m. in st. clair shores - which bills its memorial day parade as the largest in the midwest - the annual celebration begins at 1 p.m. sunday. this year, the parade route is jefferson from nine mile to 11 mile roads. st. clair shores councilman matt ahearn, who also serves as parade president, said the grand marshal this year is randy milbocker, district manager for blossom heath inn banquet center. ahearn also said regardless of the economy, it's important to take time out to salute area veterans. \"we have to do this even though it's a tough year for businesses,\" ahearn said. \"this day is for our veterans who have sacrificed so much for us. it's a must .\" motorists will have a break for the weekend on area roads and highways as the michigan department of transportation will suspend work and open as many restricted lanes as possible, said mdot spokesman rob morosi. \"whatever we can open, we are, but some things such as the mound bridge over i-696 is out, so those won't be open,\" morosi said. the mound road interchange exits will remain closed, but closed lanes on i-696 between hayes and i-94 will be open. some lane restrictions will continue on the gratiot road project between 14 mile and remick, and again between 21 mile and 23 mile roads. the following are comments from the readers. in no way do they represent the view of macombdaily.com. we encourage your feedback and

however, the older i get, the less patience i have with cleverness. if increased government spending with borrowed or newly created money is a \"stimulus,\" then the weimar republic should have been stimulated to unprecedented prosperity, instead of the runaway inflation and widespread economic desperation that ultimately brought adolf hitler to power. just days after <mark>colin campbell</mark> informed us that the american people were willing to pay higher taxes in order to get government services - and that republicans therefore needed to stop their opposition to taxes - california voters resoundingly defeated a bill to raise taxes in order to pay for the many government services in that liberal state. they say adversity concentrates the mind. now that republicans have been badly beaten in two consecutive congressional elections, what republican leaders in congress are saying today makes more sense than what they said when they were in power. when my sister's children were teenagers, she told them that, if they got into trouble and ended up in jail, to remember that they had a right to make one phone call. she added: \"don't waste that call phoning me .\" we will never know whether they would have followed her advice, since none of them was ever in jail. one of the most important talents for success in politics is the ability to make utter nonsense sound not only plausible but inspiring. barack obama has that talent. we will be lucky if we escape the catastrophes into which other countries have been led by leaders with that same charismatic talent. when i think of the people with serious physical or mental handicaps who nevertheless work, i find it hard to sympathize with able-bodied men who stand on the streets and beg. nor can i sympathize with those who give them money that subsidizes a parasitic lifestyle which allows such men to be a constant nuisance, or even a danger, to others. how surprising is it that barack obama, who spent decades hanging out with people who spewed out their hatred of america, did not say anything in the presence of foreign rulers like hugo ch \u00e1 vez and daniel ortega, when they spewed out their hatred of america? we seem to be moving steadily in the direction of a society where no one is responsible for what he himself did but we are all responsible for what somebody else did, either in the present or in the past. why let discussions with visiting celebrities be a constant distraction during a televised tennis match or baseball game? if we each sat down and wrote out all the mistakes we have made in our lives, all the paper needed would require cutting down whole forests. much discussion of the interrogation of captured terrorists ignores the inescapable reality of trade-offs. the real question is: how many american lives are you prepared to sacrifice, in order to spare a terrorist from experiencing distress? governments should govern, not micro-manage the economy. a government unrealistic enough to think it can micro-manage is likely to do a worse job than most. inspiring as it is to study the history of the struggles and sacrifices that created and preserved america, it is also painful to see how all those investments of efforts and lives are being frittered away today for short-sighted and self-centered reasons.", "articleID": "2009052604_00008823_W", "names": {"Colin

in both the bukit gantang and penanti by-elections, is being skewered for coming out in support of the internal security act (isa). \"whether the isa exists or is abolished is meaningless now. it just should not be abused, either by individuals or the government. it must be transparent and correctly applied,\" he says. lau <mark>shu shi</mark> \"i really don't think you understand the isa,\" lau <mark>shu shi</mark>, a coordinator with the penang branch of human rights organisation suaram, retorts. \"thank you, thank you,\" kamarul replies, and chuckles. \"suzy (sic) ini bahaya sikit,\" he tells the rest of the crowd. \"tapi saya akan cuba jawab soalan dia .\" and then he repeats his stand. still exasperated, <mark>shu shi</mark> hands him an anti-isa leaflet which he accepts before shaking her hand warmly. it is 28 may 2009, the sixth day of campaigning in the penanti by-election. reporters have been at their wits end trying to get in touch with kamarul. by now, everybody is resigned to listening to the digi caller ringtone loop on kamarul's mobile phone at all hours of the day. malaysians for free and fair elections (mafrel) confirmed that kamarul would be taking part in its public debate, the announcement was met with incredulity, not least by the nut graph. but lo and behold, kamarul does show up at the bukit indera muda village security and development committee compound, entourage in tow, even though he arrives half an hour after fellow independent candidate nai khan ari nai keow. the absent candidates vying for the penang state seat are parti keadilan rakyat (pkr) candidate dr aminah abdullah. faith-based politics during the debate, kamarul repeats his campaign spiel from bukit gantang. indeed, he is even recycling his posters from the bukit gantang by-election here in penanti. \"yb\" kamarul ramizu idris \"i am trying to advocate faith-based politics and development,\" he says. \"through iman (faith), we will be able to reduce corruption and social ills, bit by bit .\" he also clarifies that he is not an \"independent\" candidate per se, but a party candidate in the making. \"my independent candidacy is a temporary gig only - i am trying to register my multiracial party now (parti iman semalaysia or pis),\" he says. according to his campaign manifesto, he is not merely seeking to register his own political party, but to set up a \"global religious organisation\". after the debate, reporters crowd around kamarul - he has, after all, been virtually incommunicado. kamarul agrees good-naturedly, but not before he shakes hands with the 20-plus members of the crowd - mostly consisting of reporters and photographers anyway. when he eventually talks to reporters, we lament that he has been virtually impossible to contact. \"i'm so sorry, but it's because i go deep into the kampungs every day, and i am unable to take calls from the media,\" he explains. he says he has already visited voters in eight villages in penanti and has \"four or five\" villages left to cover until polling day. \"i am focusing on canvassing for votes, not just seeking glamour from the media,\" he stresses. kamarul says that his campaign now consists of door-to-door canvassing, and waking up at the crack of dawn to stalk newspaper vendors. kamarul's bukit gantang (left) and penanti campaign flyers \"as an independent candidate, i don't have the means to have a huge campaign, so i slip my flyers into the newspapers before they are delivered to voters' doorsteps,\" he says. he says he has printed 11,000 flyers to be distributed in the penanti by-election, and his campaign costs have come up to rm30,000. that's a lot of money wasted if he loses in penanti, as he did in bukit gantang. \"it's not a waste,\" he says. \"the important thing is that my message gets across and that my party is eventually registered .\" \"i do understand the isa\" but how is he going to get his message across if, as an exasperated lau expressed, he does not even understand issues such as the isa? \"that's unfair,\" he says. \"i do understand the isa, and i do have a stand. in bukit gantang, i also met the families of the <mark>shu shi</mark> and kamarul\" but i couldn't develop my argument tonight, because the topic that the organisers gave me was on what i could offer for the well-being of penanti as a potential state assemblyperson. and so that was what i prepared myself for. \"besides, he says, why harp on sensitive issues? one thing is clear though--kamarul is not sensitive. he takes on jibes with a smile and a chuckle .\" after all, i am a yb - yang bertanding. \"but will voters turn kamarul into\" yang berhormat \"on polling day?\" in bukit gantang, i was up against two giants (from pakatan rakyat and bn), that's why i only captured 62 votes. but here, i am up against only one giant (from pkr), so my chances are better, \"he says during the debate. the audience listens politely and kamarul beams at them. all comments are

"http://fayobserver.com/article?id=328029", "content": "what email address would you like us to send it to? washington - surely, stanley dunham was gazing skyward 65 years ago, on d-day. dunham, the man whom barack obama would one day call gramps, was a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the english channel with the u.s. army air forces when the invasion of normandy at last began. six weeks later, he crossed the channel, too, and followed the allied front across france. a year later, he was on track to fight in japan when the atom bomb sent him home instead. dunham, who died 17 years ago, was the kansas-born grandfather with the outsized personality who helped to fill the hole in the future president's life created by the absence of obama's kenyan father. sgt. dunham's war years have been something of a mystery, the details of dates and places lost with the passage of time. the units that he served in were unknown even to the white house. but a life-size portrait emerges from interviews and records unearthed by the associated press. on d-day, documents place him at stoney cross, england, in the 1830th ordnance supply and maintenance co., aviation. \"this was the day we had all been waiting for,\" dunham's commanding officer wrote the night of june 6 from their base near the english channel. \"planes by the hundreds took off and landed at our field from dusk until dawn .\" his company supported the 9th air force as it prepared for the assault on normandy and took part in the drive that carried the allies across france. dunham and the men of the 1830th came across six weeks after the initial normandy invasion and followed the front through france, servicing airfields known by numbers - a-2, a-44, a-71, and more - in places such as brucheville, cricqueville, st.-jean-de-daye, peray, clastres, juvincourt and saint-dizier. on this coming saturday, the 65th anniversary of d-day, obama will visit the gravesites and beaches of normandy and look out across the channel that his grandfather crossed from a staging area at southampton, england. \"i knew him when he was older,\" obama said of his grandfather in 2007. \"but i think about him now and then as he enlisted - a man of 23, fresh-faced with a wise-guy grin .\" to the 75 men of dunham's company, he was a good guy to have around. for one thing, he taught the men how to use their new gas masks. he also came up with a radio, games and books for a day room that dunham's commanding officer described as \"a swell place to spend an evening .\" and when the 1830th had a party in the gym three days after d-day, they had dunham to thank for it. on may 31, 1944, payday, dunham had taken up a collection of 35 british pounds - about $150 in today's dollars - to finance the event. he lined up a convoy of girls from southampton who, the men hoped, would be \"simply smashing,\" as his commanding officer, frederick maloof, wrote in his diary. \"the party was a huge success, except that the beer ran out about 10:30 p.m.,\" 1st lt. maloof later reported. \"all agreed that the orchestra was good. a few of the die-hards were still crooning over the empty beer barrels at an early morning hour .\" for all the good times, the strains of war were ever present for dunham and his fellow soldiers. on the evening after d-day, dunham's unit dug 27 foxholes. \"this was done in case of a retaliation by the germans,\" maloof wrote. on june 11, the first hospital ships returned from france, bringing tales of the \"hardships encountered on invasion day .\" that same day, maloof wrote that \"our mail has not been reaching home, and the wives and sweethearts are beginning to wonder if we have gone across the channel on the first wave .\" the wives included madelyn dunham, back home in wichita, kan., with stanley ann, a toddler who would grow up to be obama's mother. madelyn, the beloved grandmother known as \"toot\" who helped raise the future president, did her part for the war effort, working the night shift as a supervisor on the b-29 bomber assembly line at the boeing plant. her brother is part of the war story, too. <mark>charles payne</mark>, obama's great-uncle, in 1945 helped liberate a sub-camp of the nazi concentration camp at buchenwald, which obama will visit this friday. stanley dunham's older brother ralph, another great-uncle to obama, also is a branch in the wartime family tree. ralph was called up after stanley enlisted. he landed at normandy's omaha easy red beach on d-day plus four, then worked his way through france, italy and germany as an assignment and personnel officer. in the months before the invasion, the brothers met up twice in england while on leave. once, they came across each other by happenstance in london, where ralph was staying at the russell hotel. \"i walked down the steps, and there was my brother, sitting on a settee,\" 92-year-old ralph dunham said in interview with the ap. late in july, six weeks after d-day, stanley dunham's unit crossed the english channel and landed at omaha beach. \"after looking over the atlantic wall, with its pill boxes, we all agreed it was a miracle that the allies were able to land,\" maloof wrote. in his autobiography, obama reports that during the war his grandfather was \"sloshing around in the mud of france, part of patton's army .\" that's right, at least for a few months. in february 1945, at saint-dizier, dunham's unit was assigned to patton's 3rd army, and dunham remained in that company until early april. prior to february, dunham's unit had supported 1st army operations. obama sketches dunham as a man with a wild streak early on who settled down to sell furniture and life insurance. by the time he joined the army, he already had lived large. dunham also had fallen in love with a woman from the other side of the tracks - the good side - and married her. he eloped with madelyn <mark>payne</mark> just before the bombing of pearl harbor, on dec. 7, 1941, and he was quick to enlist after the japanese attack. \"he was really gung-ho,\" remembers ralph. \"he didn't have to go because he was married. he could have held off .\" he was inducted at fort leavenworth, kan., on jan. 15, 1942.", "articleID": "2009053106_00018666_W", "names": {"Charles Payne": ["Q2215790", "Q5081545", "Q5081547"]}}, {"date": "2009-06-02", "url":

berth in world cup mexico city (ap) - few doubt that brazil and argentina ultimately will qualify for the world cup finals next year in south africa. after all, brazil has played in every one, and argentina last missed out in 1970. but which other two teams will earn an automatic bid from south america? the picture should become clearer after two rounds of qualifying in the next week. a fifth south american team also will have a chance to make it, facing a playoff with the fourth-placed team from north and central america and the caribbean. paraguay, the only south american team besides brazil and argentina to play in the last three finals, leads the 10-team south american qualifying group with 24 points. with six matches remaining for all teams, paraguay is being chased by brazil (21), chile (20), argentina (19) and uruguay (17). those five are followed by colombia (14), ecuador (14), venezuela (13), bolivia (12) and peru (7). \"i think we need at least four more points to assure qualification to the world cup finals in south africa,\" said paraguay goalkeeper and captain justo villar, who plays for spain's valladolid. picking them up in the next couple of matches should be a challenge. paraguay faces third-place chile on saturday and plays away against brazil on june 10. in saturday's other games it's: uruguay vs. brazil, bolivia vs. venezuela and argentina vs. colombia. ecuador plays peru away on sunday. on june 10 it's: ecuador vs. argentina, colombia vs. peru, venezuela vs. uruguay, chile vs. bolivia and brazil vs. paraguay. paraguay's match saturday at home in asuncion will have a strong argentine flavor-paraguay's argentine coach gerardo martino will match wits with fellow argentine marcelo bielsa, who coaches chile. bielsa coached newell's old boys in the early '90s, and martino was his midfield playmaker. paraguay defeated chile 3-0 earlier in santiago, and the guarani will be strong favorites at home, but they also will be without several key players who are either injured or suspended. that includes strikers roque santa cruz and salvador cabanas, midfielder jonathan santana and defenders paulo da silva and dario veron. chile's main worry is probably goalkeeper <mark>claudio bravo</mark>, who picked up a leg injury with spanish club san sebastian. he missed chile's 4-0 loss to japan last week in the kirin cup, with chile using a second-team lineup. two-time world cup winner uruguay has played 10 times in the world cup finals, but only once in the last four. a country of only 3.5 million, uruguay has been close in recent years. in the next few days it faces both the best and worst the continent has to offer. brazil is always potentially the best team in the world with extravagantly gifted players, while venezuela is the only one of 10 south american teams never to have reached the world cup finals. the main news for the brazilians is the absence of ronaldo and ronaldinho from a team coach dunga named for the two qualifiers, and for the confederations cup. brazil travels to south africa on june 11 and faces egypt, italy and the united states in group play. brazil also may play without right back maicon, who has a right leg injury. ronaldinho's teammate at ac milan, kaka, and manchester city's robinho will lead brazil, along with sevilla's luis fabiano and milan's alexandre pato. ronaldo is a three-time world player of year, and dunga hinted he might be ready to return next year. \"ronaldo is returning from an injury,\" dunga said. \"i don't even think he would feel comfortable in the national team right now .\" argentina's last world cup qualifier was a humiliating 6-1 loss at bolivia, which ups the pressure on coach diego maradona, who has decided to bench usual starting keeper juan pablo carrizo and replace him with backup mariano andujar. \"a loss like bolivia hurts and it's not easy to forget,\" captain javier mascherano said. \"we have to take it as a lesson .\" in the concacaf region, costa rica embarrassed the united states 3-1 on wednesday in san jose, scoring after just 79 seconds and dominating every phase of the game. \"we consider us probably the fastest, strongest team in the region, but today we got out-passed, outplayed and out-competed in every sense,\" american goalkeeper <mark>tim howard</mark> said. \"we were below average across the board .\" costa rica leads the six-team qualifying group with nine points, two ahead of the united states. honduras has four points, followed by mexico with three, and el salvador and trinidad and tobago with two points each. the top three qualify for the world cup finals and the no. 4 team meets the fifth-place team from south america in a playoff for another berth.", "articleID": "2009060421_00019916_W", "names":
