Photo: Reuters Reuters, Seoul North Korea fired missiles for the third time in eight days on Friday, a series of launches that analysts say are designed to improve military capabilities and pressure the United States and South Korea as they seek to restart denuclearisation talks. US President Donald Trump, who has been hoping to revive the stalled talks with North Korea, played down the launches. The North has been testing missiles despite Trump's June 30 meeting with North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark>, where they agreed to revive the talks. South Korea's government said the latest projectiles fired by the North appeared to be new short-range ballistic missiles. The missiles flew 220 km (135 miles) and reached an altitude of 25 km (15 miles), the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in Seoul said. A US official said US intelligence had detected at least one projectile, and possibly more, that did not pose a threat to North America. US officials said initial information indicated they were similar to two other short-range missile tests by Pyongyang since last week. North Korean state media said <mark>Kim</mark> oversaw the firing of what it described as a new large-calibre, multiple-launch guided rocket system on Wednesday. He also observed the launch of a short-range ballistic missile last week. The launches appear to be intended to put pressure on South Korea and the United States to stop planned military exercises later this month and offer other concessions. <mark>Kim</mark>'s government was not only signalling negotiating demands with the tests, it was assiduously improving military capabilities, said Leif-Eric Easley, an international relations professor at Seoul's Ewha University. \"The aim is not only to increase Pyongyang's ability to coerce its neighbours, another goal is to normalise North Korea's sanctions-violating tests as if they were as legitimate as South Korea's defensive exercises,\" Easley said. Trump was asked at the White House before he set off for a campaign trip to Ohio if he thought <mark>Kim</mark> was testing him and said the launches did not violate the North Korean leader's promises to him. Trump said they were short-range missiles. \"We never made an agreement on that. I have no problem,\" he said. While Trump says he never made an agreement on short-range missiles, the 15-member United Nations Security Council unanimously demanded in 2006 that North Korea suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme and \"re-establish its pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on missile launching\" . The <mark>UN</mark> Security Council met behind closed doors in New York on Thursday to discuss the latest missile launches. Representatives from Britain, France and Germany called on North Korea after the meeting to engage in meaningful talks with the United States and said international sanctions need to be fully enforced until Pyongyang has dismantled its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said on Friday no immediate impact was seen on Japan's security after North Korea's latest launch. No ballistic missiles had reached Japan's territory or its exclusive economic zone, it said in a statement.

The newly launched Children's Cabinet will develop and implement a policy agenda that will help better serve Virginia's children and will also foster collaboration between state and local agencies. As a part of that effort, the Governor also signed a second Executive Order establishing the Commonwealth Council on Childhood Success. This Council will be chaired by Lt. Governor Northam and will focus on improving the health, education, and well-being of our youngest children. \"Children are the Commonwealth's most important resource, and it is critical that we provide them with the tools and resources they need to thrive in a 21 st century economy,\" said Governor <mark>McAuliffe</mark>. \"Both the Children's Cabinet and the Commonwealth Council on Childhood Success will help ensure that Virginia's children live happy and productive lives.\" Secretary of Education Anne Holton and Secretary of Health and Human Resources Bill Hazel will serve as co-chairs of the Children's Cabinet. Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, Secretary of Public Safety <mark>Brian Moran</mark>, Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones and the First Lady of Virginia <mark>Dorothy McAuliffe</mark> will serve as members of the Children's Cabinet. \"The Children's Cabinet provides an opportunity to work together on the complex issues that affect a child's development.

The early years of a child's life are extremely formative, and have a significant impact on their health, growth, and readiness to succeed.

I look forward to working with state agencies, local school districts, service providers, the business community, and advocates to ensure that every Virginia child has the opportunity to thrive and succeed.\" \"The establishment of the Children's Cabinet is a great first step towards addressing the basic needs of Virginia's youth,\" said Secretary Holton. \"There are schools, neighborhoods, and communities across the Commonwealth suffering under the crushing weight of entrenched poverty, and it is our goal with the Children's Cabinet to offer a helping hand, not a wagging finger.\" Secretary Hazel added, \"While regular communication between secretariats regarding children and youth issues is important, we believe a more significant impact can be achieved by delving further into the issues impacting the health, education and success of our children.\" The Children's Cabinet will focus on five specific priority areas: Eradicating the achievement gap in schools in high poverty communities. Increasing access to basic needs including housing, healthcare, and proper nutrition. Improving outcomes for youth transitioning out of Virginia's juvenile justice, mental health and foster care systems. Increasing workforce opportunities for parents and for youth as they transition out of high school."}, {"articleID": "2011042010_00018375_W", "names": {"Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]},

melissa gilbert arrives at the premiere of \"american identity\" in <mark>beverly hills</mark>, calif. downing five or more alcoholic drinks nearly every day isn't seen as a big problem for many of the nation's teens, says a report released on april 7 by the partnership at drugfree.org. \"it is much more terrifying these days than it was when we were younger,\" says gilbert, the national spokeswoman for the partnership. washington - downing five or more alcoholic drinks nearly every day isn't seen as a big problem for many of the nation's teens, says a new report. when asked if they see \"great risk\" in drinking that much, almost half the teens questioned - 45 percent - didn't see it as a big deal. the study released on april 7 by the partnership at drugfree.org also showed upward trends in marijuana and ecstasy use among young people in grades 9 through 12. \"you're seeing this weakness in this generation of teens' attitudes around drug and alcohol use,\" says steve pasierb, president of the partnership. \"it's not like this generation of kids thinks they're more bulletproof than others, but they really don't see any harm in that heavy drinking.\" and while the numbers suggest many teens do not perceive significant harm in heavy drinking, the percentage of teens drinking is down. \"it's important that we not lose sight of the progress our country has made in fighting underage drinking,\" says dr. raymond scalettar, former chairman of the american medical association and a medical adviser to the washington-based distilled spirits council. \"u.s. government data shows underage drinking and binge drinking are at record low levels.\" the partnership study also shows the percentage of teens drinking alcohol in the past month declining, down to 35 percent last year from a high of 50 percent in 1998. among teens, the average age when they had their first drink was 14, the study said. overall, 68 percent said they had consumed alcohol in their lifetime. of those, one quarter of teens had their first drink at age 12 or younger. \"it is much more terrifying these days than it was when we were younger,\" says actress and mother melissa gilbert, national spokeswoman for the partnership. gilbert, the former \"little house on the prairie\" star, is herself a recovering alcoholic who at one time was drinking two bottles of wine a night but has been sober now for six and a half years. she has faced drug-abuse struggles with one of her four sons, and she says she is doing everything in her power to make sure her youngest, now 15, knows the drama and pain addiction can bring. \"the most important thing is to get to know his friends and stay in constant communication with the people that are around him all day - his teachers, his counselors at school,\" gilbert told the associated press in an interview from her los angeles home. being sober, she says, is the best way to live. \"it's not the easiest, but it's definitely the best,\" she said. according to the study, teens said the top reasons for drinking were \"because it is fun\" and \"so they won't feel left out.\" pasierb says early drinking can often signal deeper problems. \"it's about that vulnerability,\" he said, \"why is a 12-year-old drinking?\" gregg aguero of houston, texas, says he started drinking regularly at 13 after his parents split up. that led to cocaine and other drugs and eventually landed him in rehab for several stays. now 22 and in college, aguero says he's been sober for four months and is trying to help teenagers avoid the mistakes he made. \"it's never too late,\" he tells them. \"that's the most important thing. it's never too late to turn and get help.\" other findings in the study: twenty-five percent of teens said last year that they had smoked marijuana in the past month. while that number is unchanged from the previous year, it is higher than 2008 and confirms an upward trend that ended nearly a decade of declines in pot usage among teens. ecstasy abuse also continued an upward trend, with six percent of teens reporting past-month use - up from four percent in 2008. the partnership's \"attitude tracking\" study was sponsored by the metlife foundation. researchers surveyed 2,544 teens with anonymous questionnaires that the youngsters filled out from march to june of last year. the study has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. based in new york, the partnership at drugfree.org is formerly the partnership for a drug-free america - perhaps best known for the \"this is your brain on drugs\" ads of the 1980s and 1990s. the group launched its new name last october, a move meant to position the partnership as more of a resource to parents and to avoid the misperception the nonprofit is a government

career where you personally were playing well but the team was struggling at a 1-3 stretch, possibly comparable to the panthers with <mark>cam newton</mark>? \"i'm not sure. i think my mentality is that you're never going to play a perfect game. so even though you might play very well, you're always going to think about the one or two things you could do differently to affect the outcome of the game. that would be my perspective.\" were you a little disappointed that even though you racked up over 500 yards on sunday, you managed only 23 points? \"yes. i was actually happy that we got a win on the road in a tough environment that you look at statistically in terms of that no nfc south team had ever gone in there and won. we over the last few years can point to a few games that might be similar to that. that was a team that plays very well at home. that was a team that defensively had played very well this season even though the stats in the jets game might not point to it because they were put in some bad positions, but to put up 500 yards of total offense you shake your head because you look at the scoreboard and that should show up some more. obviously you look and say why is that? we got down inside the 20 three times and just came away with field goals and not touchdowns. that certainly could have helped. we had a big play or two and it could have gotten us more points. i was, being the personality i am, i'm happy for us as a team to come out of the game healthy, get a big win and keep the streak going, but i'm also upset at myself for some things and feeling like we still have to improve at some things.\" are you impressed at how <mark>cam newton</mark> has done given the lack of an offseason? \"yes. i haven't seen any film on him. the only thing i saw was when they played jacksonville before us. it (conditions) were really sloppy, so it was hard to get a gauge for the guy. you look at the sheer statistics and shake your head. i don't care how long you've been in this league. it's hard to put up the numbers he's put up. he's certainly a raw talent. we all knew that, but i don't know if anybody could predict it, so you certainly have to give him credit for what he's been able to accomplish so far.\" how would you compare and contrast the defensive styles of <mark>john fox</mark> and <mark>ron rivera</mark>? \"they're (panthers) doing some different things. some stuff you see a little bit of the philly carryover with <mark>sean mcdermott</mark> and his experience there. <mark>ron rivera</mark> being in a 4-3 scheme up in chicago when he was the defensive coordinator there in '06 when we played him and then he went on to be the d-coordinator in san diego where they run the 3-4 and obviously now he's in carolina where they do the 4-3, yet they do some stuff in the nickel that looks like there's some 3-4 ideas. i think it's a mixture of a little bit of everything. i know they had two big injuries in (jon) beason and <mark>thomas davis</mark> but i have a lot of respect for that defense. i lot of those guys have been together for a while. i know they're pretty young up front. the secondary and those guys have been together for a while and i think it shows.\" <mark>cam newton</mark> says he's a big fan of yours and would love to learn how you run an offense. how would you size him up and what words of wisdom would you give? \"how would i size him up? he towers over me. maybe some words of wisdom after the game. i think there's always a competitive thing between quarterbacks when you're playing against each other even though i'm not directly facing <mark>cam newton</mark> and he's not directly facing me. he's facing our defense and i'm facing his defense. it's hard to go into any game against a talented young player or seasoned veteran that you know has a lot of talent and you have a lot of respect for and has a little bit of extra oomph and your kind of going step for step. but, in the end, i'm focused on scoring as many points as i can, hopefully that's more than they score, but he's obviously in our division. we're going to be seeing a lot of this guy.\" when he came to san diego? did you wonder what type of role he would have at his size? \"we drafted him in' 05. he walks in the door and you think gosh this guy is tiny by nfl standards in terms of a running back. he had accomplished some great things in college. he was coming into a situation where we had ladanian tomlinson and <mark>michael turner</mark>, so really he was just fulfilling that special teams role the first year. then from afar, i'm watching him because i liked him and wanted him to succeed. i'm watching his role increase and increase. he really was doing some great things in san diego by the time he entered his fourth, fifth, sixth season and that was a big reason why this offseason, training with him and watching the way he works, he's a pro. he does anything you ask. when it came time to go back to camp, i said to <mark>sean</mark> (payton\" , \"you might want to go after this guy .'.\" was this the first offseason you and todd durkin worked with sproles? \"yes.\" what was his mentality? \"he's a quiet guy, competitive though. there are guys like that. (is) competitive but quiet. devery (henderson), (robert) meachem, you don't hear a lot from those guys vocally, but deep down there's a fire inside that burns. sproles has got unbelievable spirit and that competitive fire. you can see little things. i think that's why he's so good with a lot of things. if you find a thing he hasn't mastered yet or quite worked on, he's going to find a way to get better at it. i see it when there's a big play to be made and he doesn't make it. it's on to the next play too. he's not one to dwell. i really like him. it's hard because my perspective that first year in san diego, him looking at ladanian tomlinson who's in the prime of his career, <mark>michael turner</mark> who i believe was in his second year, but we know what kind of player he's become, so i'm sure sprolesie was thinking he was going to watch these guys, learn how to be a pro, learn how to get it done and contribute. did i think sproles would be the player he now is when he first came in? i don't know. he's just a rare talent, not just physically, but his mental makeup. i think it takes a really tough person, physically, mentally, at his size to do what he's done.\" how often were you making casual references to him to join the saints? \"just when we trained. i didn't know what was going to happen with reggie (bush). i told him if reggie's not here, you're going to be here.\" maybe in san diego he didn't have that many snaps, but what's been the difference here? \"i'm not sure. you'd have to ask him.\" is it a situation where he's used more? \"san diego played a few primetime games. i'm a fan so i watch those. it seems like his name was always coming up. always, whether it was a catch out of the backfield for a 50-yard touchdown, a punt return, his name was always getting thrown around. he was making plays. i never really counted the snaps, but i think here, maybe what's so great about his role here is the fact with our three backs in pierre (<mark>thomas</mark>), mark (ingram) and sproles, each one of them has a role and yet you can plug them all in at any place. i feel very confident about all their skill sets. i think when you take his contributions in all phases? i think he has a hand in everything. he knows his number will get called and he'll have opportunities. i have to give a lot of credit to <mark>sean</mark>, because <mark>sean</mark> has a knack for everything. every guy has their plays, their opportunities. they're in the plan. they're going to get (their number) called. that keeps guys excited and focused, knowing that my number's going to get called and i have to get ready.\" why have you guys had trouble against carolina in the past? \"they're a tough team. i think they play us tough. this is no excuse, two times we played them in the last game of the season when we were resting starters, still if you were looking at it, it's even and i believe in that case it's 4-4. we've traded punches many times, had some close games.\" have other division games been like that? \"yes, you could say the same thing for atlanta. those have been close. tampa, the last two years has been weird. we've gone to their place the last two years and dominated and they've come to ours and beaten us. what the heck? it's divisional opponents, where you know each other well. you know each other's personnel. you really try to beat each other up each time you play. anything can happen can you talk about the importance of your third down conversion percentage?\" third down conversions are big, because those sustained drives, you wear a defense down, the more points you score, at least the more opportunities you will have to score points, the longer you can rest your defense, so they can come out there and give you the ball right back. that's a big stat. turnover ratio is a big stat. red zone efficiency is a big stat. those are a couple that i pay attention to. \"what is your explanation for what you think is a league trend for how much yardage and scoring is occuring?\" i don't know. who knows? we're only four games into the season. i'd like to think that trend's going to continue for us with the yardage, points and everything else. it's hard to put your finger on it because we were all in the same boat this season, offenses and defenses. there's always the argument about what side of the ball needs the most time to execute. you could say offensively if one guy messes up it could mess up a whole play, you could probably say the same for defense. so much of what you do defensively is just reacting, whereas on offense your interacting. i don't know. i'm just kind of talking. i don't know. what do you think of currently having six quarterbacks on pace to beat dan marino's single season yardage record that you came close to breaking three years ago? \"that's unusual. the rules i would say. even though there weren't any rules changes this offseason that i can think of that with the exception of even more emphasis of protecting players down the field with hits. guys aren't worried about catching balls and having their head taken off because of penalties and a fine. guys have more of a chance to catch it because they're hit in the body rather than the head. but other than that, they're protecting the quarterbacks the same as they always have in the pocket. you get out, throw the ball away, not go past the line of scrimmage. all those rules are the same. why this year instead of last year? everybody's searching for the answers. a lot want to blame it on the lockout. i just think there are some good quarterbacks and skill position players in this league. you see what <mark>calvin johnson</mark>'s doing. there's some freak athletes out there. did anybody expect <mark>cam newton</mark> to be doing what he's doing?

The bugle has been sounded and the rapiers are out. Allegations and verbal volleys are being lobbed. In the end, it's the image of the IOA that's getting sullied. But who bothers? The tussle between the president of the Indian Olympic Association N Ramachandran and secretary general Rajeev Mehta is out in the open. Days after the IOA president called for an Executive Council meeting on November 9, the secretary general sent out a letter calling for emergent EC meeting, but on November 7. The meet was called after 19 of 27 EC members met in New Delhi on Friday. It is learnt some of the present and past top sports administrators were present. The president is saying that according to IOA constitution only he has the right to call for a meeting, Mehta and Co believe that if the secretary has the mandate of the members, he too can call for the meeting. The two top officials of the IOA were not in agreement over the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the candidate for the president's post. There are 10 agendas listed for the meeting on November 7. The meeting will discuss \"regarding requisition notice already served to the president, IOA by approximately 70 per cent of the members\" . One of them is to discuss the actions of \"the president, IOA which have brought down the image of IOA\" . Mehta told Express that since 19 of the 27 members asked for the meeting on Nov 7, he couldn't have avoided to request. \"When so many members call for a meeting I can't stop it.\" He was also not happy that the president did not accede to the demand of 70 per cent members of the IOA who wanted a requisition meeting. A meeting of Ramachandran's supporters were held over dinner called by former IOA president Abhay Singh Chautala at Delhi Lawn Tennis Association (DLTA) on Thursday. It is learnt there were around seven to eight EC members were present. There are hectic parleys on for the posts of the treasurer of the body. It was in September (around 27/28) when, at a meeting in New Delhi between the president's rival faction, the idea of a requisition meeting was decided. The SGM, according to them, was necessitated because the term of the president and the current Office Bearers (OB) was over in March. And Ramachandran should have called for elections. The requisition for the SGM was however not considered by the IOA saying not enough members have signed the list. Interestingly, the list was handed over to the secretary who felt everything was in order for the president to call for an SGM. \"I felt the president should have called for the meeting,\" Mehta further added. Without SGM, Batra may not qualify as a presidential candidate. The IOA constitution (as it currently stands) doesn't allow a person who is not part of the executive board to contest the elections. The way things stand right now, the secretary seems to be enjoying the support of bigwigs like Narinder Batra, former IOA secretary generals Lalit Bhanot, <mark>Randhir Singh</mark>, vice-president RK Anand while the president has the support of former IOA president Chautala, former AITA president and treasurer Anil Khanna, senior vice president Virender Nanavati.
