(adrian wyld/the canadian press) / header> canada's meghan agosta-marciano celebrates a goal from haley irwin as russian goalie anna prugova flops helplessly. canada dominates russia to advance to final at world hockey championship roy macgregor ottawa - the globe and mail in news equal to the recent scientific revelation that ice is actually frozen water, canada and the united states will meet tuesday in the gold-medal game of the women's world hockey championship. it was, of course, never in doubt. canada defeated russia 8-1 monday night in front of 7,255 fans at scotiabank place in a game noteworthy for the fact that the winning goaltender outscored most of her opponents. u.s. advances to women's world hockey final with win over finland hockey russia revelling as team on the rise rachel brady team canada's szabados stands tall against women and men hayley wickenheiser, women's national ice hockey team captain and four-time olympic medallist walks the runway in the heart truth fashion show, part of toronto fashion week in toronto, on thursday, march 21, 2013. hayley wickenheiser walks the runway canadian goaltender shannon szabados picked up an assist on the opening goal when, 19:14 into the opening period, she sent a puck up ice to meaghan mikkelson, who gave it to haley irwin for a shot that bounced before skipping over the outstretched stick of russian goaltender anna prugova. prugova had been brilliant up to that point, stopping 19 of the 20 shots she faced as play was almost totally in the russian end. the canadians, while controlling play, seemed unable to convince the puck to cross the russian goal line. the dam broke early in the second period, however. moments after russia's captain, and best player, yekaterina smolenstseva put a hard shot off szabados's right post, the canadians scored again when natalie spooner was able to squeeze a shot in the short side. canada went up 3-0 when marie-philip poulin backhanded a rebound past prugova and 4-0 on a long blast from just inside the russian blueline by jennifer wakefield, the star of canada's 3-2 shootout victory over the americans in team canada's opening match of the tournament. the russians finally scored just past the game's halfway point when defender svetlana tkachyova took a shot through a screen that eluded szabados. soon, however, goals by jayna hefford and poulin, with her seventh of the tournament, had canada far out in front. third-period goals by meghan agosta-marciano and rebecca johnston - on replacement goaltender yulia leskina - were unnecessary. canada outshot russia 49-18. earlier monday, the united states defeated finland 3-0 to advance to the gold-medal match. the highlight of the game was not the shutout but the play of finnish goaltender jessie vetter, who kept the score respectable compared to the 8-0 drubbing canada had delivered the finns in the opening round. finland and russia will play for the bronze medal earlier in the day. as has been the case in every olympic and world competition, the disparity in competition had become a major issue by the time the medal round began. team sweden, which had showed promise at the turin games in 2006, when it beat the americans in the swedish miracle on ice to meet canada in the gold, showed very poorly in this tournament. the host team had skated with its own controversy since it opened the tournament wearing the black-and-yellow colours of a worthy charity founded by an unworthy, <mark>lance armstrong</mark>, whose name will forever be a euphemism for cheating in sports. after the canadians defeated the swiss 13-0 in a humiliating sacking, they erroneously tried to defend the overkill by claiming switzerland had not started its best goaltender - forgetting, it seemed, that the canadians had blasted an astonishing 79 shots at the two unfortunates who played that night. there are many unwritten rules to the game at all levels, and they range from you never, ever give a butt end to you should never, ever run up the score. there is also much good to be said about the 2013 women's world championship. first and foremost would be the impressive number of young players in the stands - young women who might one day wear the red and white (not the black and yellow of livestrong) of the national team or, for that matter, the colours of other hockey nations. second would be the strides taken by russia, an embarrassing also-ran in previous world championships. the russians did not fare well against the canadians, but they did win other games and impressed with how much they had developed in a year. the competition issue was highlighted in vancouver in 2010, when ioc president jacques rogge said women's hockey would need to become more competitive if it hoped to maintain its position in the winter games. \"it was a little shot from jacques to us,\" international ice hockey federation president rene fasel said monday. the iihf's reaction was to put two million swiss francs (about $2.2-million canadian) into women's hockey development. a mentor program, mostly featuring canadian coaches and players, has been in place for a year. asked if there was a genuine concern that women's hockey could be killed, fasel shrugged and said, \"you never know - they kicked wrestling out .\" but, he added, in his opinion, \"there is no danger .\" fasel pointed out that in the 1928 winter games that the canadian men whipped switzerland by that same 13-0 score that the canadian women beat switzerland this week. it took 78 years, but in turin in 2006, the swiss men beat the canadian 2-0. the question, of course, is will the women be shown such patience? women's world championship young guns step up for canada at world championhsips globe unlimited unparalleled

19th masters campaign with a confident two-under 70 on thursday as he sought to crown a remarkable return to the top with a long-overdue 15th major title. the 37-year-old american, who regained the world number one spot last month after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus, got off to a quiet enough start, but was two under by the turn with birdies at six and eight. watched by the new love in his life, reigning winter olympic downhill champion skier lindsey vonn, the 14-time major winner stayed there until the par-five 13th, where he moved to three-under. a bogey at the bunkerless 14th hole set him back, but he parred his way in from there to tuck himself nicely in behind the leaders. the early playing conditions in the 77th edition of the year's first major were benign, with little wind, and that led to some fireworks from the early starters. none sparkled more than cricket-loving australian marc leishman, who pounded out four birdies in a row from the 13th to come in with a superb six-under 66. \"got off to a shaky start - had a few nerves early on, but got that out of the way with a birdie at three and then we were away,\" he said. england's <mark>david lynn</mark> had earlier fired a four-under par 68 to set the early pace. the 39-year-old, who finished runner-up to rory mcilory in last year's pga championship, got to five-under after 15 holes, but a bogey at 17 pegged him back. us veteran jim furyk and 2007 masters winner <mark>zach johnson</mark> both came in with 69s, with eight players - kevin na, david toms, brandt snedeker and john huh, all of the united states; <mark>tim clark</mark> of south africa, englishmen lee westwood and justin rose and kj choi of south korea - all safely home at two-under 70. reigning champion bubba watson struggled throughout and

(ap) - the trial attorney for kennedy cousin michael skakel said tuesday he was reluctant to call experts at times during his murder trial because he worried about a\" rich man's justice perception and we could just buy experts. \"skakel's latest appeal trial began tuesday with his former lawyer defending an accusation that he failed to competently defend skakel when he was convicted of murder in 2002. skakel, the 52-year-old nephew of robert f. kennedy's widow, ethel, is serving 20 years to life in prison for the 1975 golf club bludgeoning of greenwich neighbor martha moxley when both of them were 15. skakel argues that during the 2002 trial, attorney michael sherman failed to challenge the state's star witness and obtain evidence pointing to other suspects, did a poor job with jury selection and closing arguments and didn't hire enough investigators and expert consultants. sherman, the first witness to take the stand in rockville superior court in the appeal trial, said he had been confident before the 2002 trial that he would win. sherman previously has said he did all he could to prevent skakel's conviction. attorneys for skakel argue that sherman failed to challenge the state's star witness, gregory coleman, by finding witnesses who later rejected his claim that skakel confessed to the crime. coleman testified that skakel confessed when they attended elan, a reform school in maine in the late 1970s, and said one of a few classmates he named may have heard it. sherman said monday coleman was\" patently unbelievable so i never felt i needed a smoking gun to shoot down mr. coleman's testimony. \"sherman was also pressed by skakel's current attorney, hubert santos, on whether he sought an expert to testify about elan and whether he tried to get block skakel's alleged confessions on the grounds that they were coerced. sherman said he reached out to several people, including an expert on false confessions, but felt the expert wasn't needed because the defense contended skakel never confessed .\" i didn't want to turn it into a rich man's justice perception and we could just buy experts, \"sherman said. sherman also was pressed on why he didn't obtain a police sketch of a man seen walking near the moxley property the night of the murder that skakel's defense contends resembled an early suspect. prosecutors say police concluded the sketch was of a neighbor. sherman said he did file motions seeking any sketches but didn't get them before trial. as skakel's attorney put up the sketch next to a photo of the earlier suspect, sherman acknowledged having the sketch would have been helpful. sherman also said he tried unsuccessfully to get a profile report on the suspect prepared by investigators, saying that also would have been helpful because investigators at the time backed up skakel's alibi. prosecutors say the report was hearsay and not admissible. santos questioned sherman on why he didn't call witnesses to establish that the lead investigator planned to write a book on the case, saying that could have opened a broad new line of defense. sherman said he tried unsuccessfully to find out about the book and acknowledged it could have been used in his defense. prosecutors say many of the issues were rejected in earlier appeals, including the book deal and issues related to the star witness. skakel, who lost a bid for parole last year, is hoping to get out of prison through a writ of habeas corpus arguing he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective legal representation when sherman was his attorney. santos, skakel's current attorney, argues his client's conviction is based on two witnesses of dubious credibility who claimed skakel confessed to the crime. he contends the verdict likely would have been different if sherman had conducted an appropriate investigation, obtained evidence and challenged inappropriate state evidence. prosecutor susann gill counters that skakel's conviction came after more than a dozen witnesses testified that he made incriminating statements, including three direct confessions. skakel has lost two appeals before the connecticut supreme court. 904 south side drive decatur, il 62521 primary phone:", "articleID": "2013041618_00098120_W", "names": {"Mark Kelly": ["Q10326587", "Q11770303", "Q22261100", "Q28709861", "Q357510", "Q43127604", "Q554312", "Q6768338", "Q6768340", "Q6768341", "Q6768343"]}}, {"date": "2013-04-17", "url": "http://goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2013/04/17/3910779/mourinhos-told-me-hes-leaving-spain", "content": "apr 17, 2013 4:07:00 pm the portuguese coach has been linked with a move to chelsea and paris saint-germain and those rumours will intensify following the latest revelations from <mark>manuel alvarez</mark> bet: returns: real madrid?
