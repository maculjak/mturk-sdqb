former british prime minister <mark>gordon brown</mark> on monday accused a rupert murdoch-owned tabloid of personally attacking him, failing the british people and undermining the war in afghanistan through its coverage of the conflict. in an often bitter attack on the murdoch press in testimony to britain's media ethics inquiry, <mark>brown</mark> directly contradicted murdoch's claim that the then-prime minister had made an abusive phone call to the media mogul in 2009. murdoch told the inquiry last month that <mark>brown</mark> had vowed to \"make war on your company\" after the sun switched its support to the conservatives. \"it didn't happen,\" said <mark>brown</mark>, adding that he had been shocked to hear murdoch make the allegation under oath. murdoch's news international fired back, saying in a statement that the mogul stood by his testimony. <mark>brown</mark> is the first in a string of current and former political leaders to appear this week at the inquiry, set up amid a tabloid phone hacking scandal to examine malpractice in the media and ties among politicians, police and the press. among the issues the inquiry is addressing is whether newspapers have too much power over the political agenda. <mark>brown</mark> told the judge-led inquiry that the sun newspaper was guilty of \"the conflation of fact and opinion\" in its coverage of the afghanistan conflict and of his premiership. he said that instead of covering the difficult decisions facing his government, the sun had concluded \"that i personally did not care about our troops in afghanistan .\" he said the newspaper had made a series of spurious claims, for example that he had fallen asleep during a service of remembrance for dead troops. <mark>brown</mark> said he had been bowing his head in prayer. <mark>brown</mark> asserted that the sun's coverage had done \"huge damage\" to the war effort. the former prime minister said the press had \"failed this country\" by focusing on opinions and ephemera when the war in afghanistan was at a crucial stage. \"i'm afraid half the country (afghanistan) is falling into the hands of the taliban,\" <mark>brown</mark> said, accusing the press of failing to reflect this. the sun's political editor, tom newton dunn, denied <mark>brown</mark>'s allegations, saying on twitter that the newspaper had given the conflict prominent coverage. \"military loathed <mark>brown</mark> because they felt he didn't care about them. sun reported that, but <mark>gordon</mark> rewrites history to shoot the messenger,\" he tweeted. <mark>brown</mark> had a testy relationship with the powerful murdoch press during his 2007-2010 term in office. the sun, renowned for its political clout, backed the conservative party over <mark>brown</mark>'s labour in the 2010 national election. the election ejected <mark>brown</mark> from power and produced a conservative-liberal democrat coalition government. two years on, <mark>brown</mark> appeared bruised by his relationship with a press that often characterized him as prickly and awkward. <mark>brown</mark> also spoke of his pain at seeing leaked details of his young son's health splashed in the tabloid. the sun revealed in 2006 that <mark>brown</mark>'s infant son fraser had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. <mark>brown</mark> said he and his wife sarah had been distressed by the leak? which apparently came from a hospital worker? but acknowledged that sarah had remained friendly with rebekah brooks, the sun's then-editor, and even organized a 40th birthday party for her in 2008. \"i think sarah is one of the most forgiving people i know,\" <mark>brown</mark> said. \"i think she finds the good in everyone .\" brooks, 44, along with her husband and four aides, was charged last month with conspiring to pervert the course of justice in connection with the phone hacking scandal. they are the first people to be charged in the current investigation into tabloid wrongdoing, which has shaken britain's media, police and political establishments. more than 40 people have been arrested and questioned. the ethics inquiry was set up last year after revelations that the now-defunct news of the world had hacked the mobile phone voice mails of scores of celebrities, politicians and even crime victims in its quest for scoops. britain's current treasury chief, <mark>george osborne</mark>, testified later monday about his relationship with murdoch's media empire. prime minister <mark>david cameron</mark> faces questioning on thursday. <mark>osborne</mark> spent the early part of his testimony answering questions about his relationship to the murdoch family. he is also likely to be quizzed about his role in hiring a former editor of murdoch's scandal-tarred tabloid news of the world, andy coulson, as communications chief for the conservative party. after <mark>cameron</mark> became prime minister, coulson served as downing st. communications chief before resigning because of the scandal. ___ jill lawless can be reached at: subscribe to this comment thread by email cancel the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. by using this web site you agree to accept our report offensive content: if you believe this comment is offensive or violates the cbsnews.com terms of use, you can report it below (this will not automatically remove the comment). once reported, our staff will be notified and the comment will be reviewed. offensive: sexually explicit or offensive language advertisements, commercial links, or repetitive posts disruptive posting: flaming or offending other users illegal activities: promote cracked software, or other illegal content e-mail this comment to a friend. e-mail this to: send me a copy of this message note: your e-mail address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail and in case of transmission error. neither your address nor the recipients's address will be used for any other purpose."}, {"articleID": "2014052304_00069314_W", "names": {"Michelle Williams": ["Q156796", "Q229153", "Q23893381"]}, "date": "2014-05-22", "url": "http://92moose.fm/destinys-child-reunite-michelle-williams-say-yes-listen/", "content": "Destiny's Child Reunite on <mark>Michelle Williams</mark>' New Song \"Say Yes!'

\"you have to learn to like what you see in the mirror,\" she tells glamour. \"there are definitely times when i don't feel like myself, but you have to fake it until you make it .\" check out the rest of kim's kim looks so much more beautiful \"undone\" january 3rd, 2011 i don't think she's sexy at all, because it's all fake. if you look at pictures of her throughout the years, it's obvious how much work she's had done. her sister kourtney has natural beauty, so i don't understand why everyone's so crazy about kim. i agree - you're not sexy - you're plastic. anyone can look like that with a wallet like your's. all it takes is puffed lips - and no those are not natural how big she's blown them up to be? her boobs are fake - she's had those blown up, you can see the silicone base around the edges and how they don't fall naturally. the botox she finally admitted to and looks like a wax figure. kim, you don't look like a 20 year old - you look like a 30 year old in serious crisis. leah, umm you are confused. kourtney is the one that has said she has had implants. she is by far the \"natural\" one of the three girls. kim has not and the only thing she has done is botox. how can you say she is fake. she is gorgeous even as a small child. all those girls are beautiful, implants or not. please do not take this as an attack anyone but for those who keep saying she got work done? i mean yes her upper lip looks a little bigger on this picture ok, maybe she did get something done there or it could be some kind of lipstick the makeup artist used to plump them up more like they advertise on commercials? for the most part though what i wanted to suggest was? how do you guys know that throughtout the years her bone structure just didn't mature? i know it may sound crazy to some people but there are some people that do not contain the same baby face that they had while younger your bone structure changes throughout the years. things fill out and you may become wider than usual. i don't know her personally but i do know that she's beautiful rather real or fake. she already admitted to getting surgery done to her stomach because of past abusive relationship now that's over and done. what more do you want her say or do? no matter how real or fake she is she's still a gem. i do think kim is beautiful but i also think it's sad that she feels she has to wear that much make up at 30 years old. i don't think any woman needs to wear that much make up. kim has natural beauty and less make up would look better on her and she'd still be a knock out. umm? she's right. she's not sexy. too conceited (who tweets endless bikini pics of themselves?!) and narcissistic. she looks so much better with less makeup. zoom in on a pic of her - between the eyeliner, fake lashes, ten pounds of foundation - it's hard to tell where the real kim starts. add a comment got something to add to this post?

I'm deeply sorry to anyone I have offended--both at the time and since they've been recirculated. \"I've grown up a lot since then and learned a lot about life, but I accept that I have to take responsibility for the comments I have made in the past and will be a better, wiser person for it .\" A Spokesman for Leicester said: \"Hamza's approach to addressing the matter and the remorse he has expressed shows the maturity he has developed in the years that have passed since the comments were made .\" He now has a far greater understanding of the impact his words and behaviour can have and is committed to using that influence in the positive, respectful and accepting manner his more recent growth has demonstrated. \"Related articles"}, {"articleID": "2011102101_00061545_W", "names": {"John Paul": ["Q1701359", "Q6252169"]}, "date": "2011-10-21", "url": "http://deseretnews.com/article/705392820/Utah-laws-can-prevent-wild-animal-scares-like-that-in-Ohio.html", "content": "utah laws can prevent wild animal scares like that in ohio salt lake city - ferocious predators on the prowl over night in ohio echoes a similar scare on the southeastern idaho border 16 years ago, and it represents the kind of nightmare scenario that utah laws are intended to prevent. the real-life safari hunt in zanesville, ohio, started tuesday night when terry thompson opened the gates and cages at his animal farm, where he had permits to house exotic animals. according to investigators, he then shot himself to death. lions, bears, leopards and wolves ran loose, leaving a community in terror and barricaded in their homes. \"it's like noah's ark wrecking right here in zanesville, ohio,\" said wildlife expert jack hanna. all the animals were either killed or recaptured, with one exception - a monkey that's still on the loose. a similar episode in idaho struck fear into residents of lava hot springs in 1995. nineteen lions, tigers and hybrid \"ligers\" escaped from a ramshackle facility known as \"ligertown .\" the privately owned collection of chicken-wire and plywood enclosures proved to be far too insecure to hold such dangerous predators. idaho deputies killed the last of the escaped cats several days later when it was found at a local elementary school, evidently stalking prey. officials in utah say a tough wild-animal law here protects the public. \"the state law in utah is very strict,\" said mark hadley of the utah division of wildlife resources. \"basically it prohibits people from being able to have wild and dangerous animals in their possession .\" it wasn't always so. <mark>john paul</mark> fox, chief investigator for the humane society of utah, remembers numerous private zoos and wild animal collections in the 1970s and 1980s. \"they were a big concern for us,\" fox said. \"dirty cages, lack of veterinary care, poor diets .\" the facilities were typically roadside tourist attractions or animal suppliers to movie companies. \"there was a lack of security in all those facilities,\" fox said. \"you could just drive on the site, walk in among the grizzly bears or jaguars or cougars. there would be nobody there the whole time you'd be there at the facility .\" "}]
