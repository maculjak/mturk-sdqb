to make oil companies more responsible, and to ensure existing laws apply equally to the industry. warman pointed at canada's oil sands, saying the trend of developing dangerous sources of petroleum needs to stop. the national wildlife federation supports the development of alternative energy sources and modes of transportation. warman said it was important to collect the information and share it, because most incidents are localized, and the stories don't often get shared nationally. he added \"the petroleum industry has a vast war chest running a very effective campaign to cover up these stories. the top ten petroleum companies made 150 billion dollars in profit in 2009. they have effectively spent this money to cover up the story through litigation, through marketing and pr campaigns and through lobbying to avoid being held accountable .\" according to the report, 19 people have died in separate incidents in 2010 alone, and, counting the deepwater horizon, there have been three oil spills in 2010. here, highlights incidents that have occurred since 2000. one of the more horrific accidents was one that occurred in 2000. three families had gone camping beside the pecos river in new mexico, camping over top of a pipeline that ruptured and exploded. seven adults, 3 children and two babies were camped over top of the pipe, miraculously, six people initially survived the blast, which created a fireball so large and ferocious, the fire department couldn't get within a half mile of the fire. only when things seemed to be under control were the survivors found. they later died of their burns, which were so bad, the survivors were said to resemble mummies. the rupture and explosion were found to have been caused by corrosion, which weakened the pipeline. offshore drilling is no stranger to accidents. the u.s. mineral management service, recently renamed as the bureau of ocean energy management, regulation, and enforcement said there have been nearly 1,500 incidents over a 6 year period. \"...of these incidents, 41 fatalities, 302 injuries, 476 fires, and 356 pollution events were reported .\" the advertiser reported that \"...independent oil and gas companies currently account for about half of the nearly 400,000 jobs, $70 billion in economic values and $20 billion in federal, state and local revenue generated by the industry in 2009 .\" the us consumes around 20 million barrels of petroleum per day, the paper said. the united states has proposed legislation to create a stronger safety standard for offshore drilling, the associated press reported, but that legislation needs to be passed by senate, and has been stalled. if the legislation passes, there will be no cap on liability for offshore spills. the legislation also proposes that companies with a poor track record of employee safety and environmental protection should not be approved for offshore drilling permits.", "articleID": "2010073119_00291506_W", "names": {"Jack Doyle": ["Q16233105", "Q39089724"]}}, {"date": "2010-08-05", "url": "http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2010/08/05/baker-palling-around-with-hudak.aspx", "content": "bill hudak, republican congressional candidate in <mark>john tierney</mark>'s district, has not been universally embraced by mainstream massachusetts republicans--in fact, when hudak announced that <mark>scott brown</mark> had endorsed him, <mark>brown</mark> quickly denied it and forced a retraction. that cold shoulder is due to some rather disturbing and, some might say, nutty opinions hudak has expressed, such as once suggesting to journalists that he had documentation proving that barack obama was born in kenya. but <mark>charlie baker</mark> has no problem appearing with the guy. a couple of weeks ago, <mark>baker</mark> accepted an invitation to speak at a large hudak event; he came, took the stage with hudak, and briefly addressed the audience. the photo above, obtained by the phoenix, shows <mark>baker</mark> speaking at the event, gesturing to the bow-tied hudak. \"<mark>charlie</mark> was speaking to voters,\" campaign spokesperson rick gorka told me, when i asked about <mark>baker</mark> choosing to associate with hudak. \"we're going to talk to voters everywhere .\" originally reported by tri-town transcript. among the highlights: hudak, in 2008, proudly displayed on his boxford lawn an array of anti-obama signs, one of which depicted barack obama as osama bin laden. he showed reporters documents that, he claimed, proved that obama was born in kenya. (he has admitted showing the documents, but now denies that he believed them .) he claimed that obama had ties to the muslim faith. he referred to obama as \"barry soetoro,\" as is common on so-called \"birther\" web sites. asked whether <mark>baker</mark> personally considers hudak's questioning of obama's citizenship, or comparing obama to bin laden, offensive, gorka replied: \"they're not things <mark>charlie</mark> agrees with .\" pressed again, gorka termed those things \"outrageous,\" but would not accept the characterization of \"offensive .\" (as an aside, i'm not sure why the <mark>baker</mark> campaign brought in gorka from the republican national committee to be its press secretary--not only is he alien to massachusetts, but his resume of working for folks like <mark>katherine harris</mark>, <mark>michael steele</mark>, and the now-defunct freedom's watch may not make him a great fit for our poitical-media landscape .) the event <mark>baker</mark> appeared at was a hudak campaign fundraiser/rally at the north shore music theater in beverly--\"stand up for america: a celebration of freedom .\" todd feinburg, jeff katz, and <mark>barbara anderson</mark> participated, and hudak claims that 500 people attended. among those on hand were former congressman peter torkildsen, state representatives <mark>brad hill</mark> and <mark>brad jones</mark>, and a host of area legislative candidates. gorka insists that <mark>baker</mark>'s on-stage appearance did not suggest an endorsement of, or support for, hudak. but wicked local topsfield, for one, came away with a different impression; a photo caption accompanying their story about the event included the line: \"also on hand to support hudak's candidacy for the 6th district seat were <mark>charlie baker</mark>...\" and, while hudak is clear that <mark>baker</mark> has not endorsed him, he did suggest, at the least, a camaraderie between the campaigns, when i asked him about <mark>baker</mark>'s appearance. \"we're all in this working together,\" hudak says. i've spoken with hudak a couple of times, and he comes across as a nice enough guy. but, his rabid, conspiratorial, admittedly internet-researched attacks on obama are about all we have to assess him; he had never been politically active prior to his late - 2008 outburst of anti-obamaism. pretty much all we know is that he believes, and acts upon, crazy, offensive things he reads on the internet. i can't imagine that it helps <mark>baker</mark> to associate himself with that fringe of the republican party. plus ultimate 2010 jam revealed, <mark>joe perry</mark> wrecked, and <mark>neil young</mark> unplayable the low anthem, yim yames, john prine, <mark>sharon jones</mark>, edward sharpe and more, live from newport, july 30 - august 1, 2010 ontario dream-pop duo find inspiration in the library stacks getting folked prine, helm, and edward sharpe highlight the newport fest burn baby burn <mark>john kerry</mark>, <mark>scott brown</mark>, and the death of climate-change legislation the black keys live at the bank of america pavilion, july 31, 2010 [video] interview w/aa bondy - hahaha...people in dr. seuss hats! \"you know, the modern primitive kind .\" the most exclusive father abraham webterview in the history of the world british newspapers out alleged wikileaks source, a soldier, as being gay; queer-bashing has already begun ticket on-sale alert: 16 shows including temper trap, of montreal, scissor sisters, matisyahu, and jonas brothers (zomg!)", "articleID": "2010080515_00019145_W", "names": {"Barbara Anderson": ["Q453631", "Q457873", "Q52555829"], "Brad Hill": ["Q39069936", "Q4953997", "Q4953998", "Q4953999", "Q4954939"], "Brad Jones": ["Q26834399", "Q2923402", "Q299228", "Q4954040", "Q4954041", "Q4954042", "Q56280650", "Q896802"], "Charlie Baker": ["Q28051620", "Q5076629", "Q5084482", "Q56254750"], "Joe Perry": ["Q313378", "Q377430", "Q537432", "Q6211782"], "John Kerry": ["Q22316", "Q6242998"]}}]
