"http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1029006.html", "content": "in 2006 the check point software technologies company, which specializes in protecting computer systems from hackers and data theft, wanted to acquire an american company called sourcefire, which works in the same field. the great advantage of sourcefire was that its clients include the american defense department and the national security agency. the u.s. administration, however, by means of the committee on foreign investment in the united states, did not approve the acquisition. the committee made its decision based on an opinion by the federal bureau of investigation and nsa security officers. the two organizations were afraid that check point, which was founded by gil shwed and fellow graduates of unit 8200, the israel defense forces' high-tech intelligence unit, would have access to top-secret information, which it could pass on to israel's intelligence community. the fear and suspicion currently is directed not only toward check point, but also other israeli high-tech companies like verint, comverse, nice systems and persay voice biometrics, some of which work in data mining and engage in software development for tapping telephones, fax machines, e-mail and computer communications. the above accusations come from journalist and writer <mark>james bamford</mark>, whose new book, \"the shadow factory: the ultra-secret nsa from 9/11 to the eavesdropping on america\" (doubleday), came out this week in the united states. <mark>bamford</mark>, a former producer for the abc television network, has spent the last 30 years writing about the nsa - one of the most important and least-known intelligence agencies in the united states, but usually in the shadow of the central intelligence agency. the nsa is responsible for eavesdropping on telephones, fax machines and computers; intercepting communications and electromagnetic signals from radar equipment, aircraft, missiles, ships and submarines; and decoding transmissions and cracking codes. it has contributed immeasurably to u.s. intelligence and national security. in this respect, the united states resembles israel: successes attributed to the mossad should often be credited to other intelligence units - first and foremost unit 8200, the israeli equivalent of the nsa. this is <mark>bamford</mark>'s third book, and it affords a look into the mazes of the nsa. in 1982 the justice department threatened to prosecute him for revealing agency secrets in his first book, \"the puzzle palace: inside the national security agency, america's most secret intelligence organization.\" in his second book, \"body of secrets: anatomy of the ultra-secret national security agency,\" he described the nsa with a great deal of enthusiasm, which made him the organization's hero of the day. the nsa even organized a party in his honor at headquarters in fort meade, maryland. his new book, which is critical of the nsa, has sent him back to his starting point. <mark>bamford</mark>'s main thesis is that before september 11, 2001, the agency failed along with other intelligence agencies in understanding the al-qaida threat, even though it had intercepted members' phone calls and e-mails. this stemmed in part from excessive caution for upholding laws and respecting citizens' privacy. in april 2000, then-nsa director general <mark>michael hayden</mark> (currently the director of the cia), vividly described to a congressional committee how, if at that very moment osama bin laden were to step onto the peace bridge at niagara falls and cross into the united states, \"my people must respect his rights.\" after the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon, the organization swung over to the other extreme. according to <mark>bamford</mark>, since september 11 the nsa has had no compunctions about violating the constitution and has been eavesdropping on american citizens. one of the outstanding examples in the book, which has been well-covered in the american media, is the fact that the nsa has listened in on bedroom conversations of journalists, military officers and officials serving in iraq. the nsa may eavesdrop on and intercept transmissions outside the united states, but cannot do so to american citizens without a court order. another of <mark>bamford</mark>'s important assertions, which also concerns israel, is that the largest telephony and communications companies in the united states - in fact all of them except qwest - have cooperated with the nsa, allowing it to tap their lines and optic fibers. the above-mentioned israeli companies and others are important software and technology suppliers for not only the american telephony companies, but for the nsa itself. <mark>bamford</mark> claims that 80 percent of all american telephone transmissions are conducted by means of the israeli companies' technology, know-how and accessibility. thus, <mark>bamford</mark> believes, the american intelligence community is exposing itself to the risk that the israeli companies will access its most secret and sensitive digital information. <mark>bamford</mark> does not provide any backing for this thesis; he only points to a circumstantial relationship. the israeli companies were largely established by graduates of 8200, and therefore he says they are connected by their umbilical cords to israeli intelligence, and their ceos and boards of directors include senior shin bet officials like arik nir or former mossad chief ephraim halevy (nir is the ceo of athlone global security, a hedge fund that has invested inter alia in persay voice biometrics, and ephraim halevy is a member of the athlone advisory board). to put it mildly, <mark>bamford</mark> has no love lost for israel. in his articles, he publishes claims by american navy officials who believe israel maliciously attacked the american spy ship liberty during the 1967 six-day war. he holds that the september 11 attack did not stem from radical islam's basic hatred of america, but rather from its anger at the united states' support for israel. he calls the nineteen september 11 terrorists \"soldiers\" and describes them with a great deal of sympathy - davids who \"only\" demolished four airplanes of the american goliath. in this context, and apparently because of his deep hostility, <mark>bamford</mark> asserts that in light of the problematic record of israel, which did not hesitate to spy against america on american soil, israeli companies should not have been given the keys to the kingdom of america's secrets. his attitude toward israel apparently pushes him over the psychological brink, as his book hardly mentions the close cooperation

of...hypocrisy Lynda Waddington, Exact Change August 15, 2015 | 7:00 am Pardon the dust, but it's time we brush off one of the Republican Party's binders full of women. And, no, I'm not talking about Mitt Romney's fictional debate binders, but the very real autopsy report commissioned by the Republican National Committee in the wake of the 2012 election. Romney garnered support from male voters, but experienced an 11-point deficit among female voters. And, when single women were singled out, the gap became a cavern of 36 percentage points. The report concluded women are not a \"coalition,\" and appealing to them should be integrated into all activities. GOP talkers \"need to use language that addresses concerns that are on women's minds in order to let them know we are fighting for them.\" Among the findings was that women voters are interested in hearing facts. \"Many of them run the economies of their homes and understand economics better than the men in their families.\" Give props to baby steps; maybe next time the RNC will notice women also dare to run businesses. Additional baby steps: \"They feel like they are smart, engaged and strong decision-makers, but that their opinions are often ignored.\" Acknowledging that women \"feel\" they have brains is a start, albeit a very small one. The report does not call for reconsideration of issue stances that led to the \"War on Women.\" Instead, Republicans are encouraged to point fingers, making sure \"feeling\" women understand Democratic positions also impact them. Psst: Next time, tell us something we don't know. Republicans, the report admonished, need to put women on the national stage, not only as candidates, but as spokeswomen because...wait for it...they \"are far better at connecting with these voters because they are more likely to understand them.\" The real kicker is that existing Republican officials and the 2016 field can't even be bothered to attempt to follow these meager and condescending recommendations. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, arguably a benefactor of the RNC report, reacted to secretly-recorded videos of Planned Parenthood staffers discussing how the organization engages in the legal practice of accepting reimbursement costs when supplying fetal tissue to researchers by sponsoring a bill prohibiting the flow of women's health care dollars to Planned Parenthood. Republican Mitch McConnell, who championed the law that opened the door on fetal tissue sales, was her co-sponsor. The measure held the same ick factor as <mark>Donald Trump</mark> telling women how pretty we look on our knees--you know, when we aren't bleeding out of our wherever. Ernst's proposal was not to ban fetal tissue use in research, or to change the reimbursement framework. It was not an attempt to end abortion, because the targeted funding provided birth control, STI testing and prenatal care. The RNC binder should have noted that even the breast-burdened understand the hypocrisy of launching a program, then demonizing those who play by your established rules. Having Ernst as the messenger makes no difference.

It's not the first time the 21-year-old Dane has punched above his weight against the Chinese champion, narrowly losing in a three-set battle for gold in the Australian Open in May. A devastated Axelsen said he struggled to find rhythm and get the best of his formidable opponent. \"I was so close to getting the second set, but <mark>Chen Long</mark> played better than me here,\" the young hopeful told reporters after the match. \"Of course when I look back in a few days I can be proud of my performance today...but when you are so close to winning it's pretty disappointing.\" <mark>Chen</mark> progresses to the semi-finals where he will face fourth seed Kento Momota, who dispatched Hong Kong's <mark>Wei Nan</mark> 21-6, 21-14. The 20-year-old Momota, who won the Indonesian Open in June, said he was hoping to face Axelsen but is determined to do his best against the defending champion. \"<mark>Chen Long</mark> is the number one seed, so I hope to prove myself against him,\" the Japanese star said through a translator. In the women's singles, world number one Carolina Marin appeared at her most confident as she charged past her toughest opponent yet, seventh seed <mark>Wang Shixian</mark> of China, 21-17, 21-19. The Spaniard showed no sign of the ankle injury she incurred on Thursday and kept her cool even as <mark>Wang</mark> put her through her paces in the second game. Marin will next face the winner of another quarter-final match scheduled later on Friday between ninth-seeded Korean Sung Ji-Hyun or India's P.V. Sindhu. \"I don't care if it's going to be Sung Ji-Hyun or Sindhu,\" a confident Marin said. \"We will see who wins.\" Indonesia's unseeded shuttler Lindaweni Fanetri upset Taiwan's Tai Tzu Ying, bouncing back from a slow start to defeat the fourth seed 14-21, 22-20, 21-12 before a roaring home crowd. Unseeded Japanese pair Naoko Fukuman and Kurumi Yonao, who dismissed the second-ranked Chinese pair on Thursday, continued their rampage in the women's doubles with a 25-23, 21-14 win over 13th seeded Indian pair Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa. There were fewer surprises in the mixed doubles, with the top three pairs - two from China and one from Indonesia - progressing to the semi finals. Five-time world champion <mark>Lin Dan</mark> and second seed Jan O. Jorgensen go head-to-head later Friday in what is expected to be one of the tournament's fiercest contests to date. The winner of that match will likely face Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei who has returned from an eight-month doping ban guns blazing. The unseeded former world number one has already knocked off two seeded opponents in Jakarta, and is expected to do the same with Hong Kong's <mark>Hu Yun</mark> later Friday. (+ + +) Read also:"}]
