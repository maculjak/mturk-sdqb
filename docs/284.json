His Jackson Northwest High School bowling coach, Gerry Lobdell, responded by saying, \"About time .\" The well-timed joke drew a dry smirk from Lewis, who had a spare the frame prior--and 15 straight strikes before that. Lewis, a senior, rolled the first 12 strikes of the first game of a match against Jackson at Airport Lanes for a 300 game. He added three more strikes to start the second game before a solid 9-pin ended his bid at a second perfect game. But his first game had the place jumping and everybody buzzing when it was over. \"The 10th frame, it was pretty scary but a great feeling,\" said Lewis, who led his team to a 26-4 victory over Jackson. \"The first one was pretty good, the second one was pretty good and the last one got a little inside, but it held in there and got the job done .\" Lewis is the seventh high school boys bowler to roll a 300 game this season, as reported to the Michigan High School Bowling Association website. Lewis also joins a list of recent Northwest bowlers to record 300 games in high school matches, joining Sierra Lasky in 2014, Corey Daniels in 2012 and <mark>Nick Taylor</mark> in 2011. Teammate Trevor Simons had a 300 game in November during the Greater Jackson USBC youth city tournament at Brooklyn Lanes, bowling with Lewis and fellow seniors Chris Salkowski and Tyler Ockert. Lewis remembered the moment Simons got his perfect game. \"It was awesome to watch,\" Lewis said. \"I felt kind of proud, it was cool. I was like,' I want to go get one of those .'\" Bowling with a Roto Grip Hyper Cell he also used to shoot his previous high game of 289 during a Youth Masters tournament, Lewis packed the pocket 12 straight times in the first game. He showed no nervousness, even as the crowd went silent in the late-going. \"The 10th frame was when they really got bad,\" he said of the nerves. \"When I was going up for the last one, I thought I was having a seizure. I wasn't sure, but that's what it felt like. Up until then, it wasn't too bad .\" In the crowd for his feat were his parents, Terry and Nancy Lewis, his girlfriend, and a large gathering of Northwest supporters. He said picking up his first perfect game with his team was the way he would have drawn it up. \"It's awesome getting to celebrate with the guys,\" Lewis said. \"It's nice having their support .\" Lewis finished the second game with a 213 for a 513 two-game series for Northwest (3-1). Simons, incidentally, had a solid day on the lanes himself, firing scores of 258 and 243 for a 501 series. Rob Dunham added games of 205 and 243 for the victors. Jackson (4-3) was led by Drake Csage with games of 257 and 235 for a 492 series, Joseph Bleiler with 213 and 223 (436) and Jacob Oberst with 236 and 188 (422).", "articleID": "2015012200_00003952_W", "names": {"Nick Taylor": ["Q16195356", "Q18128640", "Q20190704", "Q30084790", "Q59569480", "Q7028023", "Q7028025"]}}, {"date": "2015-01-22", "url": "http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2015/01/the_quiet_battle_for_the_soul_of_billy_preston_is_being_fought_in_a_santa_ana_courtroom.php", "content": "A Rap Against Rape By Gabriel San Roman On Nov. 21, 2005, the man known as \"The Fifth Beatle\" lay on a hospital bed, dressed in street clothes, thrashing and gasping for air. Billy Preston had just arrived at the Intensive Care Unit at <mark>Daniel Freeman</mark> Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey, rushed there from the Canyon, a nearby drug-rehab center. A large, frustrated nurse wrestled with the legendary, 59-year-old organ player, struggling to fit a black oxygen mask over his face. Eyes wide with fear, Preston dodged his head back and forth, unable to breathe. Holding his hand at his bedside was Preston's manager, Joyce Moore. She tried in vain to calm him down. \"I gripped him tight and said,\" Boo, you gotta relax,' \"Moore says .\" I thought he was having a panic attack. I kept saying, \"Breathe with me...breathe with me .'\" But it wasn't a panic attack or the pangs of crack withdrawal. Years of drug abuse had culminated in malignant hypertension and pericarditis, the internal drowning of the area around Preston's heart. He mustered the strength to push the mask away, look up at Moore and painfully utter his last words: \"I...can't!\" Suddenly Preston's eyes rolled back, and his grip loosened. The monitors flatlined. Even after doctors drained the fluid around his heart, he didn't wake up. He lay in a coma for nearly six months before dying on June 6, 2006. The loss is a nightmare that Moore's mind refuses to erase. \"I feel like Billy's sitting here. It's weird...He never leaves,\" says the spindly, silver-haired 69-year-old. \"It's not a physical presence, more like a conscience thing .\" Producing a string of acclaimed albums and hits through the 1960s and '70s, Preston's talent is knitted into the fabric of rock & roll, soul, gospel, and funk. In life, his talent defied gravity. The same goes for the financial mess that has followed his death. On a recent Tuesday night, Moore, dressed in a black-and-white-striped cardigan, sits in an empty restaurant inside a Costa Mesa hotel. There's barely room for food on the table, which is covered in court documents, the earthly remnants of Preston's ghost. They're pieces of the musician's tangled, now-long-posthumous bankruptcy case, originally filed in 2005. For nearly a decade, Moore has waged a quixotic battle with bankruptcy trustee lawyers in Santa Ana's Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse. Besides settling what the bankruptcy trustee believes to be Preston's $4 million debt, there's the fight over money gained from Preston's intellectual property and royalties from Preston Music Group Inc. (PMGI), of which Moore is the CEO. Decades later, Preston's soulful classics--including \"Nothing From Nothing,\" \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" and \"That's the Way God Planned It\" --sadly describe the legal battle that has followed his death. Accusations of misconduct have been leveled by both sides of the case. The bankruptcy trustee's lawyers accuse Moore of using Preston's royalties for her own financial gain, not paying his debts and refusing to disclose the financial records of PMGI. In the media, she's been accused of isolating Preston from his family in life and hoarding his money in death. Moore insists the bankruptcy trustee has no right to go after intellectual property as part of the delinquency of Preston's estate and that the entire case itself is a fraud. The war has put a hold on concerts, tours and projects done in the artist's memory--in other words, it kills any and all projects that might create revenue to pay off his creditors.", "articleID": "2015012201_00018036_W", "names": {"Daniel Freeman": ["Q18149703", "Q39051822", "Q42157784"]}}, {"date": "2015-01-22", "url": "http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/128731/money-mensch-martin-lewis-victim-commuter-rage", "content": "<mark>Martin Lewis</mark> Journalist <mark>Martin Lewis</mark> was a victim of \"commuter outrage\" on his way to work on Wednesday, he has revealed on his Facebook page.

(AP) - Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Thursday he doesn't know how footballs became deflated during the game that got his team to the Super Bowl. But Belichick declined to answer questions after saying he knew nothing until Monday morning about accusations that his team cheated with underinflated footballs in its win against the Colts in the AFC championship game on Sunday night. The NFL is investigating. Belichick said the team is fully cooperating. \"I had no knowledge of this situation until Monday morning,\" said Belichick, who said he was \"shocked\" to learn the news. \"I would say I've learned a lot more about this process in the last three days than I knew or have talked about it in the last 40 years that I've coached in this league,\" Belichick said during an 8 1/2 - minute opening statement during an 11 1/2 - minute news conference. \"I had no knowledge of the various steps involved in the game balls and process that went through .\" Belichick did not specify who in the Patriots organization was responsible for the underinflated balls, or absolve anyone besides himself of potential wrongdoing. Softer balls are generally considered easier to throw and catch, and quarterbacks, specialists and equipment managers are known to have very individualized preferences in how footballs are readied for games. Belichick said he was unaware of the process for game balls until the accusations were raised. Belichick said he sometimes hears quarterbacks, kickers and other specialists talk about their preferences. \"I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy from me whatsoever on that subject. Zero,\" Belichick said. Patriots quarterback <mark>Tom Brady</mark> is expected to address reporters later Thursday. \"<mark>Tom</mark>'s personal preferences on his ball, footballs, are something that he can talk about in much better detail and information than I could possibly provide,\" Belichick said. \"I can tell you that in my entire coaching career I have never talked to any player, staff member about football air pressure .\" The NFL requires balls to be inflated between 12.5 and 13.5 pound per square inch. Under league rules, each team provides 12 balls for use on offense. Referees approve the balls more than 2 hours before game time, then keep the balls until they're turned over to ball handlers provided by home teams just before kickoff. Belichick said the balls used by the Patriots offense are inflated to the \"12 1/2 - pound range\" and \"any deflation would then take us under that .\" Going forward, he said, the Patriots will inflate footballs to a safe level to prevent them from dropping under allowable air pressure during games. \"We will take steps in the future to make sure that we don't put ourselves in this type of situation again,\" he said. The coach who has won three Super Bowls said he generally forces players to practice under bad-ball conditions. \"Anytime players complain about the quality of the footballs, I make it worse and that stops the complaints,\" he said. \"We never use the condition of the footballs as an excuse. We play with whatever or kick with whatever we have to use .\" The issue has drawn strong reaction from around the game and its fans as the Patriots prepare to play the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 1 in Glendale, Arizona, for the NFL title. Several players said it would not distract them in preparing for the game. \"It's unfortunate. We'd rather be celebrating our trip to the Super Bowl,\" special teams captain <mark>Matthew Slater</mark> said. \"It's important to us that we respect the game and deal with things in a way that's considered professional .\" Copyright \u00a9 2015 Sinclair Interactive Media", "articleID": "2015012222_00042963_W", "names": {"Matthew Slater": ["Q52906896", "Q6791235"], "Tom Brady": ["Q2376327", "Q313381", "Q7815037"]}}, {"date": "2015-01-23", "url": "http://tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/scott-recommends-money-for-individuals-with-disabilities/2214899", "content": "State Roundup CFO Jeff Atwater, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam call for investigation into FDLE firing CFO Jeff Atwater, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam call for investigation into FDLE firing Gov.

SABMiller's lager volumes were 1% lower in its third quarter after a similar contraction in the first half of its financial year, ending in March. In China, volumes fell 9% in the third quarter, following a 10% fall in the previous three months when bad weather over the peak summer season dented sales. Wholesalers remained overstocked going into the third quarter and it weighed on orders during the three-month period, a company spokesman said. Kagiso Asset Management investment analyst Dirk van Vlaanderen said: \"While China contributes around 20% of SABMiller's group volumes, it only adds around 3% to group operating profit and so the unexpected Chinese volume decline in quarter three is unlikely to have a significant profit impact at a group level .\" SABMiller said its group net producer revenue, or sales less excise and similar taxes, grew 4% in the third quarter. Continuing a previous trend, lager volumes were down 1% while soft drink sales remained buoyant, with volumes up 4% in the quarter. SABMiller CE <mark>Alan Clark</mark> said the firm's Latin American and African businesses \"continued to grow both volumes and revenues, together with Europe, while more difficult trading conditions, particularly in China, held back the overall group performance\". In Colombia - SABMiller's single most profitable market where its share of beer is about 98% - net producer revenues grew 5% with overall beverage volumes up 1%, held back by a 1% decline in lager volumes. SABMiller is preparing to deal with a fresh wave of competition in Colombia, as soft drinks group Postob\u00f3n and Heineken - controlled brewer Compania Cervecerias Unidas eye a share of the market from a brewery they are developing. SABMiller said lager volumes in the country were \"impacted by a shift in consumer spending patterns, along with pressure on disposable income driven by increased levels of household debt and rising inflation\". SABMiller's lager volumes were up most in Africa, with growth at 3%. In SA, which was consolidated under SABMiller's Africa region from July last year, net producer revenues grew 6%, \"driven by positive pack and brand mix in lager\". Both lager and soft drinks volumes grew 2%. The fastest growing African countries for the brewer were Mozambique, where net producer revenue was up 26% on a 21% jump in lager volumes; and Nigeria, where net producer revenue grew by a third. Van Vlaanderen said SABMiller's third-quarter numbers \"were a bit of a mixed bag\" with Latin America and Africa offsetting weaker performances in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. \"The negative impact of a strong US dollar against SABMiller's key currencies meant reported sales actually fell by 5% in quarter three. We remain concerned that some of SABMiller's key emerging markets remain vulnerable to slower growth rates and further currency weakness given their dependence on oil and other global commodities .\" While some severe currency devaluations were already evident, \"we believe the inevitable consumer slowdown in these regions makes the growth outlook challenging in the quarters ahead\" , Van Vlaanderen said.
