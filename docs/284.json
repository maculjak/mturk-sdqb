"mark webb/the herald-dispatch the veterans memorial field house, pictured here on thursday, april 21, 2011, will be handed over to marshall university by the end of february 2012. huntington--the veterans memorial field house's days officially were numbered wednesday night after the greater huntington park and recreation district board unanimously voted on a deal that would put the property in the sole possession of marshall university by the end of february 2012. after months of negotiations, park and university officials reached a deal earlier this month that will allow for the transfer of the property from the district to marshall for a planned soccer stadium complex, which also will include a public park. part of the deal requires that any structure constructed on the property, regardless of ownership, will include \"veterans memorial\" in the title, which will be accompanied by appropriate signage. any other naming rights or sponsorships will be prohibited from being displayed more prominently than the \"veterans memorial\" sign. the deal also includes $100,000 from marshall to the district to create a half-acre neighborhood park on the site that also would commemorate veterans. the park, which will be named \"veterans memorial park,\" will include a playground, a picnic shelter and an american flag-themed rock-climbing wall. many of the deal's details involve making a notable dedication to veterans, which always was the goal of the field house said ken wolfe, president of the park district. \"the number one thing in all of this was for us to be able to continue to honor the veterans,\" wolfe said. \"we were never concerned that we would lose that, and this will even be sort of an upgrade in how we honor them and pay tribute to them by taking a deteriorating structure they used and providing a brand new facility that will still be named for them and available for their use .\" one of the details of the deal simply states that \"marshall university will make the new facility for available for community use,\" and that the university will be responsible for \"satisfying any and all claims that other entities, including the cabell county board of education, may have on the property .\" the park district will honor its commitments through february 29, 2012, which include the st. joe invitational basketball tournament, which will be one of the final events to take place in the field house. a veterans memorial field house grand finale basketball game is planned for saturday, feb. 11, 2012 and will be the very last event at the field house before it is transferred to marshall. the proceeds from the finale will be split 50-50 between the park district and marshall as will the proceeds from a salvage sale featuring items including chairs and the basketball flooring that will take place at a later date. in the past decade, the park district has spent more than $520,000 to support revenue losses at the field house, but the board was not looking to sell the property when marshall officials approached them this past spring. marshall plans to spend approximately $5.4 million through a bond issue to demolish the field house and build a soccer stadium complex that would include a turf field, seating, locker room facilities and lighting. the field house has a leaking roof, which has been patched numerous times, and, when the board was approached about the deal, they were looking into repairs that would have cost between $940,000 and $1.4 million. wolfe said there was \"no reasonable likelihood\" that the district would ever be able to obtain funds to replace the roof. jason aldean \"my kinda party\" tour 2011 7:30 p.m. saturday, oct. 1. featuring special guests <mark>chris young</mark> and thompson square.

mic says he'll release memo WASHINGTON--Scenes from the Capitol on a night of pomp, pageantry and politics for the State of the Union address: Talk about stepping on one's message. Jan 31, 2018 12:25 AM by: Canadian Press WASHINGTON--Scenes from the Capitol on a night of pomp, pageantry and politics for the State of the Union address: Talk about stepping on one's message. Schmoozing in the House chamber after delivering his maiden State of the Union speech, a hot mic caught President Donald Trump telling a Republican lawmaker that he was \"100 per cent\" in favour of making public a classified Republican intelligence memo. That was further than the White House had gone on the matter and not something Trump had said during the hour-plus speech he had finished moments earlier. In the C-SPAN video, Rep. <mark>Jeff Duncan</mark>, R-S.C., urged Trump to release the memo. Trump, with a microphone nearby, can be heard saying, \"Don't worry, 100 per cent .\" The White House had said earlier Tuesday that it would conduct a legal and national security review before Trump decides whether to release the memo. It has sparked a political fight pitting Republicans against the FBI and the Department of Justice. ___ It's not a question that typically needs asking. But yes, the White House says, Melania Trump rode back from the Capitol in the same car as her husband, President Donald Trump, after his State of the Union speech. That wasn't a foregone conclusion. The first lady had not been seen in public with her husband since the Wall Street Journal reported that lawyers for Trump paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 to stay quiet about what the porn star said was an affair with the future president. Daniels said in a statement Tuesday that the affair she had described never happened. The couple's 13th anniversary passed without public comment. And Mrs. Trump abruptly cancelled her trip with the president to Davos, Switzerland, for an economic summit. Mrs. Trump travelled separately from her husband to the Capitol for the address. Her aide said she had held receptions at both places for the guests seated with her for the speech. The president began his speech by acknowledging \"the first lady\" along with other congressional leaders. Mrs. Trump did not visibly react. ___ It wasn't the longest State of the Union address. That designation still goes to former President Bill Clinton. But an hour and 20 minutes of President Donald Trump talking Tuesday was plenty long enough for House Democrats. Just before Trump finished, their leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, made eye contact with Rep. <mark>Joe Crowley</mark> of New York and pointed toward the back of the House chamber. Democrats followed their lead and made an unusually quick beeline for the exits. Earlier, Pelosi had warned House Democrats not to leave the chamber mid-speech. Trump's first State of the Union address clocked in at about eight minutes shorter than the final such address by Clinton. ___ They could all agree to support 12-year-old Preston Sharp and his project to plant flags on the graves of veterans. But it was a different story when President Donald Trump used that good deed to scold athletes, ahead of the Super Bowl, who kneel during the national anthem. Members of Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court and assorted guests applauded Trump's shout-out to Preston, who noticed that not every grave was decorated with a flag at the California veterans' cemetery where his grandfather was buried. He started collecting donations and, two years later, had decorated 23,000 graves. \"Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance,\" Trump said during his speech, drawing applause. But the mood changed when the president added: \"...and why we proudly stand for the national anthem .\" GOP lawmakers erupted in applause. Democrats were far more muted. Trump was a leading critic of NFL players, predominantly African-American, during last fall's protests. Vice-President Mike Pence abruptly left an Indianapolis Colts game after almost two dozen members of the San Francisco 49ers knelt during \"The Star-Spangled Banner .\" ___ Their leader, Nancy Pelosi, warned Democrats to behave during Trump's address and \"let the attention be on his slobbering self .\" The president didn't slobber. Some Democrats couldn't hold back, especially when Trump mentioned immigration issues. \"Oh, c'mon,\" Rep. <mark>Joe Crowley</mark>, D-N.Y., audibly enough to be heard in the gallery overhead, as Trump mentioned open borders, letting in drugs and gangs. They laughed out loud when Trump cast his immigration proposal as a down-the-middle compromise. And they groaned when Trump spoke of ending \"chain migration .\" Pelosi extended her hands to try to quiet her colleagues. ___ Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill ., strolled through the Capitol before the speech with a guest who was attracting more attention than he was. Tall and sporting a ponytail was Jayson Werth, an outfielder who played the last several years for the local Washington Nationals. Werth said he has an organic farm in Davis' district. Asked if he was a Trump supporter, Werth said he was a moderate. \"I'm just spreading my wings a little bit,\" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Alan Fram contributed to this report. ___ Follow Kellman on Twitter at www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman Laurie Kellman, The Associated Press"}, {"articleID": "2018090910_00150284_W", "names": {"Carlos Ramos": ["Q19402537", "Q19966735", "Q3476506", "Q3660122", "Q5042526", "Q5042527", "Q57081680"]}, "date": "2018-09-09", "url": "https://www.newkerala.com/news/read/43966/serena-williams-points-at-sexism-in-controversial-defeat-in-us-open-final.html", "content": "Serena Williams points at sexism in controversial defeat in US Open final 2 minutes ago Sep 09, 2018 IANS New York, Sep 9: Former world number one Serena Williams was the centre of all attention at Flushing Meadows despite having lost the US Open final to young Japanese rising star Naomi Osaka (6-2, 6-4) in a match mired in controversies and penalties. Wiliams, who failed to clinch her seventh US Open title and 24th Grand Slam, directly accused the chair umpire, Portuguese <mark>Carlos Ramos</mark>, of sexism during a post-match press conference Saturday, reports Efe news. <mark>Ramos</mark> called out three violations against Williams in the second set: the first being a warning about receiving coaching, the second a penalty point for racket destruction and the third another penalty for verbal abuse for calling him a \"thief .\" \"He took a point from me. He alleged that I was cheating, and I wasn't cheating. Then I had a good conversation with him. I said, Listen, you know my character. You know me really well. I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose,\" Williams said. \"Then when I sat down, I said it again (...) I can understand what you saw because it may have looked (...) like I was getting coaching, but I'm telling you, that's not what I do,\" she added The younger of the Williams sisters claimed that male tennis players go unpunished even when they argue and use bad words on court all the time. \"I've seen other men call other umpires several things. I'm here fighting for women's rights and for women's equality and for all kinds of stuff. For me to say\" thief' and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. He's never taken a game from a man because they said \"thief,'\" said Williams at the press conference. Williams then argued that her protest could serve as an example for people who have emotions and want to express them with total freedom. \"I just feel like the fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next person that has emotions, and that want to express themselves, and want to be a strong woman.

tribune construction of a new storm water sewer system in winnetka could cost as much as $74 million depending on financing and could also be partly paid for by residents based on the amount of storm water runoff created on their property, officials said. village staff and trustee are still trying to define the scope of the proposed storm water project, how to pay for it - and whether the village should even undertake the ambitious public works endeavor at all. but preliminary figures complied by village staff and consultants show it would cost winnetka about $48.2 million to build a \"comprehensive\" storm water drainage system to relieve chronic flooding problems in parts of the community. staff also said the $48.2 million figure would decrease if the village decided to move ahead on a less comprehensive storm water management system. winnetka, il, usa the $48.2 million price tag, however, does not include the immense cost of financing the project. during a recent \"rate and fee analysis workshop\" village staff and consultants told trustees that the total cost of the undertaking would ring in at slightly more than $74 million when including interest paid on bonds over a 30-year term. they also said the project would cost about $66 million if it was financed over a 20-year term. winnetka homeowner rick mcquet attended the feb. 12 workshop and he said he left the meeting with a lot of unanswered questions. \"i have not heard a reasonable explanation of why this proposed project is going to be so expensive on a per resident basis,\" said mcquet, who has lived in the village for five years. he also said his online research indicates that the proposed winnetka sewer water project would be the most expensive storm water utility in the country on a per resident basis. <mark>steven saunders</mark>, winnetka's director of public works, acknowledged that some residents may get sticker shock when then see the dollar amounts associated with the cost of the project, but he also said those figures are not carved in stone and could be significantly lower because the village has yet to decide on the scope of the project or how it will be paid for if it is eventually built. he also said the village is seeking residents input on all aspects of the proposal. \"as the concept gets further refined, we will want significant public discussion and engagement in terms of gauging public opinion and educating the public on the benefits and the costs of the project and the various ways (it) could be paid for,\" he said. \"questions come in from time to time, and we encourage those. we have a lot of information posted on our website .\" parts of winnetka have been facing a monster-flooding problem for years, and the issue came to forefront in a big way in 2011 following a severe summer rainstorm that caused widespread flooding. last year, the village started looking at building a new $35 million storm water sewer tunnel under a section of willow road and spending more than $8 million in six residential areas where there's been flooding. the workshop also included discussion of the possible creation of a \"storm water utility\" to help pay for the project and possibly tapping into village reserves to help defray the amount that would have to be borrowed. under one scenario illustrated by village staff and consultant municipal & financial services group, residents would pay a storm water utility tax based on the amount of \"impervious surface\" on their property, <mark>saunders</mark> said. \"the more impervious surface on a parcel, the more runoff that is generated,\" he said. \"it's essentially a user fee based on how much storm water a parcel would generate .\" typically \"impervious surfaces\" on residential properties include the driveway, patios, walkways and the area on which the house sits, so the more impervious surfaces on an individual property the higher rate they would pay, said <mark>saunders</mark>. he also said the same formula would be applied to commercial properties. \"basically what we're trying to achieve is a system of equity whereby folks that generate proportionally more storm water pay in proportion to the amount of storm water they generate,\" he said. according to information on the village website, proper storm water management is a general benefit to all property owners in that it helps to protect property from flooding, increases environmental protection and allows for safe travel in and around the village. according to the website, the goal of a storm water fee is to equitably assess the cost of providing storm water service to property owners based on their impact to the storm water system. \"i disagree that the storm water utility is a benefit to all property owners in the village,\" mcquet said. \"there are a large number of resident who have never experienced flooding. the bulk of the flooding problem is concentrated in a relatively small part of the village .\" <mark>saunders</mark> said the village is scheduled to discuss issue again during a march 12 workshop at the winnetka village hall."}, {"articleID":

has proved a recipe for success By Community contributor Show caption See all photos images Skip to next image \"0 comment NOT many Southend restaurants make it to their 40th anniversary, but the Polash, in Shoeburyness, is no ordinary eatery. The business has been a fixture for 40 years, and so have many of the customers as well. The West Road restaurant rides high in the food stakes. Patak's Curry Guide has listed it among the top 30 Indian restaurants in the entire UK. Stronger, though, than even the strongest curry, is the loyalty the this place engenders. Some of the diners at Polash's tables were there in 1979. when it first opened. For them, the Polash experience is not just a question of an eat in, but of a love in. One of those decades-long regulars is Adventure Island owner Philip Miller MBE, executive chairman of Stockvale .\" In fairness, I am a relative newcomer, as I have only been visiting for the past 35 years! \"he says. Mr Miller is in no doubt as to what keeps drawing him back. He says:\" The food has always been first class, but then it is in many other restaurants locally. It's the genuine warmth that sets it apart. It's something you can only get at the Polash and it's a magic formula that cannot be copied. \"The special atmosphere at the Polash stems directly from the owner and founder, Sheikh Khalique, and his personal rags to riches story. One of six brothers, Mr Khalique arrived in England from Bangladesh in 1967 .\" My father wanted me to study, but I just wanted to get out and work, \"he says. At 16 he started out as a waiter at his uncle's restaurant in Wembley, and found that he had a real flair, and love for, the work. Another brother, Harun, was separately forging a career as a skilled chef. The brotherly network went into overtime when a third brother, Ahmed, told Sheikh and Harun about an opportunity he had spotted. Ahmed was working in Southend, and had learnt that a launderette site in West Road was about to become vacant .\" By then I had my own strong idea for running my own business, \"says Mr Khalique. The idea does not sound so radical now, but back in 1979, when restaurants from the Indian sub-continent were still labelled as\" curry houses, \"it was highly original. It consisted of authentic sub-continent cuisine, using locally sourced raw materials. Mr Khalique describes it as\" going back to the roots \".\" When we opened, we were something special. Since then, lots of people have copied us, to be honest, \"he says. Shoebury residents bought into the Khalique brothers' culinary vision from day one. There were queues round the block on opening night. Then came a rave review by restaurant critic Jim Worsdale in this newspaper .\" Mouthwatering \"was one of the more low-key adjectives that he used .\" I remember that review by heart, \"says Mr Khalique .\" Since then, we have never looked back. \"Over those 40 years, however, the Polash, once so innovative, has come to be known for another, quite different quality--unchanging reliability. The world changes, but the Polash doesn't. It remains a reassuring haven .\" We don't react to changes in fashion in the industry, \"Mr Khalique says .\" We keep things authentic and traditional. \"Not that he allows complacency to settle in .\" The items on the menu, they frankly have not changed that much, \"he says .\" People have come to love them. But we constantly work to improve (the recipes). \"This sense of continuity clearly influences the customers. The Polash is a family run business, and the clientele are also something of an informal family .\" Nearly everyone who eats there sort of knows each other, and we greet other customers like old friends, \"says Philip Miller. Food apart, it is the warm welcome that Polash fans extol. Service values lie at the heart of Mr Khalique's philosophy. He says that a lot of industry trainees seek out the Polash .\" They know that this is a good place to learn the skills, and that time spent training at the Polash will be a good qualification for jobs elsewhere, \"says Mr Khalique .\" Many of my waiters have gone on to open their own businesses. \"The core principles he teaches are not complex, boiling down to eight words .\" Welcome with a smile. Take care of customers. \"He makes it sound almost cosy, but the road to the Polash was a tough one by any standards .\" My background was very poor, \"he says .\" I had to walk 10 miles to school. Across fields--there were no roads. \"At that stage, he made a resolution .\" I promised myself that if ever I had the opportunity, I would help build a high school in my home village. Thankfully I had that opportunity. \"Mr Khalique kept his promise to himself. Working with local fund-raisers back in Bangladesh, he was instrumental in setting up Shahkamal High School, which opened in 1990. The school has around 600 pupils,\" and they are all very appreciative \". He is also widely involved in charities here at home. Philip Miller, also active in charities, comments:\" The family have always supported local charities with curry nights at detriment to his usual trade no doubt, but that is the kind of guy he is. \"The Polash has stayed reliable and unchanging for 40 years. What about the next 40? Regulars seem unworried. The Echo spoke to one of them, <mark>James Pearson</mark>, from Shoebury Barracks. He first came to the Polash with his father, at the age of seven. He said:\" I've been coming ever since, and it's always been the same. Same smile. Same greeting. And same delicious food. The Khalique family know how much customers value that unchangeability, so I bet nothing too revolutionary will happen over the next 40 years. \"Certainly, the next generation look a safe bet. Sheikh's son Rubel spent much of his childhood at the restaurant, studying cookery with his uncle, chef Harun .\" He used to hurry home from school, \"says Mr Khalique .\" He just wanted to get into the kitchen. \"Rubel is now effectively in charge of the kitchen, following Harun's semi-retirement. He says that he plans to develop and improve the regular dishes .\" I am very curious, and I like to experiment. \"One idea he is developing is the notion of Indian-style variations on trad British dishes like turkey dinners and Beef Wellington .\" But it will still be the Polash that people know and love, \"he promises. Right now, major change seems a very remote concept. Customers are still met at the door by the boss and founder, just as they were back in 1979. Now 67, Sheikh Khalique flirted briefly with retirement, but did not enjoy the experience .\" I don't like just sitting down, \"he says. He was soon back at the Polash door .\" Being here, meeting and greeting people, that's what I love, \"says Mr Khalique. 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2019012519_00398388_W", "names": {"Jack Reed": ["Q528979", "Q6114777", "Q6114779", "Q6114783"], "Brian Fallon": ["Q2503485", "Q27656993", "Q4963711"]}, "date": "2019-01-25", "url": "http://www.fox13memphis.com/news/politics/trump-backs-down-on-shutdown-agrees-to-fund-government-for-3-weeks/909924780?utm_source=homestream&utm_medium=site_navigation&utm_campaign=homestream_click", "content": "Trump backs down on shutdown, agrees to fund government for 3 weeks Need a profile?

While the President sought to put the best light on the developments, it was a major shift for Mr. Trump, who had repeatedly refused to open the government, and allow for negotiations on border security to go forward--as his decision on Friday basically accepted what Democrats had called for since before Christmas. The President finished his remarks by saying if there's no deal by February 15 on a border wall, then he would use his powers to declare a national emergency, and move money around in the federal budget to build a wall. President Trump: \"I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government .\" --CSPAN (@ cspan) January 25, 2019 The announcement came on the 35th day of the partial government shutdown, which began before Christmas when the President rejected a plan which he had previously agreed to--a short term plan to keep the government open until February 8--sparking a standoff over funding for the President's plan to build a border wall. Democrats said the bottom line of the President's announcement was simple--President Trump had backed down, unable to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in the Congress to give him money for his border wall. \"After he said,\" re-open the government, \"I think everyone stopped listening,\" said Rep. Rick Larsen. \"This is a recognition by Pres Trump that his forced shutdown is hurting America and is the wrong way to try to change policy,\" said Sen. <mark>Jack Reed</mark> (D-RI). \"This is not a major legislative achievement, and the President should never have inflicted pain on America for 35 days, but this is a first step,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI). \"It's about damn time,\" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). As for Congressional Republicans, some quickly pointed the finger of blame at more conservative GOP lawmakers in the House, who pressed the President to force this shutdown fight. Senior R: \"I hope the president remembers this when the Freedom Caucus types tell him what to do next time. They only have a first move--start a fight. They never have a second move .\" --John Bresnahan (@ BresPolitico) January 25, 2019 \"It's long past time to open our government again,\" said Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), one of a group of more moderate Republicans who had expressed public disdain for the shutdown strategy. Just yesterday, the President had demanded a \"down payment' on a border wall in any short term funding deal--but that fell flat as well with Democrats. The only agreement the White House was able to get was that the House and Senate would proceed to negotiations on a bill to fund border security .\" Democrats don't usually remain this firm, but thanks to Pelosi, they did, \"said Democratic strategist <mark>Brian Fallon</mark>.\" And they won. \"Next Up:"}, {"articleID": "2012050911_00050150_W", "names": {"Joe Sheridan": ["Q23773993", "Q6212330"]}, "date": "2012-05-09", "url": "http://hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=168453", "content": "queeney: criticism has united us 09 may 2012 jamie queeney claims meath's recent woes on and off the field have had a galvanising effect on the team. the royals have received plenty of stick following their relegation to division 3 of the allianz league and the county board's failed attempt to oust seamus mcenaney as manager, but enfield man queeney claims such criticism has only served to make them more united. \"we know that will bond us,\" he said at yesterday's leinster championships launch. \"we can even see it at training, we are sticking together. we know everything that went wrong and things have been said about us. we hadn't a good league and fair enough but as players we just need to hold up our hands and say we need to perform better. we had a few meetings and decided we would all knuckle down for the championship .\" queeney acknowledged that <mark>joe sheridan</mark>'s return from boston, and his two-goal haul against westmeath in last monday's challenge match in boardsmill, has boosted meath morale. \"<mark>joe</mark> is <mark>joe</mark>, he loves a goal,\" he continued. \"we done well. it was just a challenge, but we performed well. it's good to have him back. we welcome any player into the panel, especially one of <mark>joe</mark>'s calibre. he is a good character to have in the dressing-room."}, {"articleID": "2019110612_00106126_W", "names": {"Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"]}, "date": "2019-11-06", "url": "http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/national/18018136.green-party-vows-make-general-election-climate-election/", "content": "Green Party vows to make General Election the \"climate election' By Press Association 2019 General Election 2019 0 comment The Green Party has vowed to make the General Election the\" climate election \"as it launched its campaign with a pledge to borrow more than \u00a3 900 billion over the next decade in a bid to rid the UK of fossil fuels. Co-leader Sian Berry said the party wanted to turn the UK carbon neutral by 2030 and said she wanted the December 12 poll to\" go down in history as the turning point for climate justice \". Ms Berry, who is a London Assembly member, said she was determined to make the General Election more than just the Brexit election. Green Party co-Leader Sian Berry (left) with colleagues Carla Denyer and Amelia Womack (Ben Birchall/PA)\" There is something I want to make clear right from day one of this our Green campaign, \"she said .\" Boris Johnson wants to make this the Brexit election, a re-run of the referendum, a fight on his terms, on his dodgy turf. But this election is about so much more. \"Ms Berry said her party, which more than doubled its MEPs at the last European elections, was the strongest voice for remaining in the EU .\" Yes, the Greens are the strongest voice for remaining in the European Union because we must protect environmental standards and work with our neighbours to avoid climate chaos, \"she said .\" We must protect our precious freedom of movement, our human rights and our peace because we must remain and transform. \"Some things are even bigger than Brexit .\" This must be the climate election and the future won't get another chance. \"We must make sure this election goes down in history as the turning point in our fight for climate justice .\" Despite all this the Greens don't fear the future, we are the future. \"We stand at the threshold of what will be the most exciting and prosperous period of our country's history because taking action on the climate emergency isn't just about averting disaster it's about creating a brand new Britain .\" Under the plans unveiled today at the campaign launch at the We The Curious children's science museum in Bristol, the party are promising to spend \u00a3 100 billion a year over the next decade for a \"Green New Deal\". Some \u00a3 91.2 billion of the proposed yearly spending will come from borrowing, with the party arguing that the low cost of debt and impending climate crisis justifies the commitment. The rest of the money will come from its proposed tax changes, with which it also hopes to service the cost of the borrowing. They would also hike corporation tax by 5%, which will be used to build 100,000 energy-efficient homes a year and upgrade national transport infrastructure. (PA Graphics) The UK's national debt currently sits at \u00a3 1,790.9 billion, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. Under <mark>Theresa May</mark>, the government committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But the Green Party hopes to better that goal with its so-called Green New Deal, which it hopes will also encourage increased investment from the private sector. The spending commitments come after a year of increasing pressure from environmentalists, including the direct action group Extinction Rebellion. Bristol has been seen as a fertile ground for the Green Party, where they currently have 11 councillors. It was the first city to declare a climate emergency following a motion proposed by Councillor Carla Denyer, the party's parliamentary candidate for Bristol West. On Tuesday night the council's cabinet approved plans to ban diesel cars from the city centre by 2021. The Greens are also believed to be targeting Stroud in Gloucestershire, where MEP Molly Scott Cato is standing, and Newport West in South Wales. Speculation over a so-called Remain alliance between the Greens, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru has been growing over recent weeks. A spokesman for the Greens confirmed that the parties were \"having discussions\" but refused to say whether an electoral pact had been agreed. In 2017, the party said 22 candidates were standing aside to boost the electoral hopes of opposing progressive candidates. 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2017101923_00244881_W", "names": {"Liam Griffin": ["Q6539614", "Q6539615"], "Michael Haley": ["Q21621422", "Q22279202", "Q3308234", "Q6830906"]}, "date": "2017-10-19", "url": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-remix-why-oct-20-230000561.html", "content": "Jim Cramer took a trip down memory lane to 30 years ago, when the market suffered its worst one-day plunge ever. More CNBC's Jim Cramer had a unique experience during the historic market crash of 1987 that occurred 30 years ago Thursday. \"People always want to talk about Black Monday, 30 years ago today where the Dow lost 500 points, erasing more than 20 percent of the market's value,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But as bad as Black Monday was, believe it or not, it was the next day--Terrible Tuesday, as it was known back then--that really scared the bejesus out of people .\" The day after the crash, investors, traders and fund managers alike could not determine the lay of the land, Cramer said. Stock prices were unclear, equities were falling, and the futures suggested the market had another 20 percent decline ahead. \"It was as if the world had ended and it didn't matter what you owned, it was going to be beaten down to a pulp by the endless cascade of Chicago S & P futures raining on the New York Stock Exchange,\" Cramer said. \"I was scared stiff .\" But in the week before the crash, Cramer got a lucky call that helped him save his hide.

But every sell-off is different, so Cramer decided to review his \"targets of opportunity\" to see if the stocks he has wanted to buy on weakness were indeed pulling back.
