a mental edge or defeat for australia in saturday night's four nations final dress rehearsal against new zealand. australian centre brent tate believes the winner of the dead rubber in auckland would earn a huge psychological advantage going into the tournament final at suncorp stadium on november 13. \"both teams will want to win on saturday night...i think it will definitely give the winner an edge (in the final),\" he told aap. \"you always want to be winning going into finals matches and psychologically it's a huge advantage .\" australian coach tim sheens blasted his charges' second half performance in last sunday's 34-14 victory over england, claiming the kiwis would be encouraged by australia's patchy ruck defence. tate concedes the australians let themselves down with sloppy handling and porous defence last weekend, but backed them to bounce back from the criticism. \"i think it's just a general thing of tightening everything up,\" he said. \"i think we dropped too much ball the other night, and defensively we were a little bit too loose as well .\" sometimes it doesn't take too much to sharpen those things up so hopefully come saturday night we can put a really good performance together. \"but we've got a lot of classy players in our side and a lot of big game players to help us do it .\" tate added the kangaroos will need to keep a close eye on playmaker benji marshall, with the kiwi star able to punish teams who take their foot off the gas. \"they are a dangerous team if you give them any space, especially with a guy like benji dictating terms the way he has been,\" he said. \"they've got plenty of strike players out there and the challenge there for us now is to do our best and try and stop that .\" marshall's west tigers teammate <mark>lote tuqiri</mark> knows the kiwi superstar's game better than most, but even he was struggling to come up with a plan to stop reduce his impact. \"i guess it would be easier, but you never know with benji, he's an unpredictable player,\" <mark>tuqiri</mark> told aap. \"and you can't really let your foot off what you're trying to do and relax because that's the time he'll pounce .\" obviously our defence was pretty ordinary last week, and in cases where they did score a few tries we let ourselves down in the communication and i guess reading the defence so that's something we'll work on this

"culpeper town council, board of supervisors near an agrement on water and sewer service by donnie johnston culpeper mayor chip coleman rolled down the car window and took a puff on his cigar. \"we're about there,\" he said. coleman had just left a special board of supervisors meeting called to try to refine language in a proposed 30-year-plus water and sewer agreement between the town and county. coleman was right: the tone of yesterday's meeting was far more amicable than the last time the board discussed the issue. in fact, with the exception of a few minor changes, the supervisors seemed satisfied with the body of an agreement that would have the town serve adjacent areas of the county with water and sewer service in exchange for a maximum of four non-contested boundary adjustments. well, almost. when county attorney roy thorpe suggested that the changes agreed to yesterday be sent to richmond attorney carter glass, who is drawing up the final agreement, two supervisors balked. \"i'd like to see the changes one more time,\" said supervisor sue hansohn, who had earlier declared, \"it's not as complicated as it sounds .\" when supervisor <mark>steve</mark> nixon echoed her sentiments, supervisor <mark>steve walker</mark> asked why. \"i'm not 100 percent sure what my thinking is at this point,\" nixon responded. over the course of an hour and a half, the board yesterday discussed almost every possible annexation scenario that it didn't discuss in its last two-hour-plus meeting. split parcels, doughnut parcels, doughnut-hole parcels, flagpoles, peninsulas and farm land that might end up inside the town limits were all ingested, digested and, in some cases, regurgitated. in the end, about the only issue that separated the two bodies from a final agreement revolved around the words \"average\" (town usage) and \"minimum\" (county) regarding strips of land that allowed the town to get to new territory. supervisor tom underwood also didn't like the fact that the 30-year agreement would continue--perhaps into perpetuity, he said--if the 1.5 million gallons of sewage treatment capacity the county gets is not used up. \"i don't like an agreement where i can never walk,\" underwood said. the rest of the board made it clear that underwood was an island in this respect and moved on. enter your fredtalk username and password to post a comment on this

the dust settles on the 2010 midterm elections, those pro-life lobby groups that helped win significant pro-life gains in congress are already gearing up to ensure that the fresh victories are converted into action on behalf of unborn americans. one of those groups, the susan b. anthony (sba) list, on thursday announced the launch of its \"stop abortion funding\" campaign, aimed at ending all federal funding of abortion in the upcoming 112th congress. the campaign includes a website designed to help pro-life activists lobby congress to defend the defenseless by defunding abortion. \"now is the time to translate tuesday's pro-life electoral gains into pro-life legislative victories,\" said sba list president marjorie dannenfelser. dannenfelser said that on tuesday a large number of those who voted for the abortion-funding health care law \"learned the consequences of their vote,\" and have been replaced \"by authentic pro-life voices supported by a strongly pro-life gop

lincoln city, oregon - although veterans day is not officially celebrated until thursday, many communities across the u.s. have already paid tribute to those who wear the country's military uniform with various veterans' day themed tributes. one of the nation's top public events to honor veterans took place in the coastal oregon community of lincoln city back in september. \"celebration of honor\" honors veterans over five days now in its fourth year, this annual \"celebration of honor\" tribute in lincoln city lasts for five days with dozens of daily activities to honor both veterans and their family members. against a backdrop of 1,000 american flags and the striking panorama of the pacific ocean, suzanne totten walked slowly with an oregon army national guardsman to present a flag for her late husband douglas in the \"field of honor .\" totten said she was \"deeply moved\" after the ceremony. \"douglas served during world war ii, and was badly injured on iwo jima. now that he's passed, it brings great comfort to be here for this celebration of honor for all our veterans,\" said totten with tears in her eyes as she stood in pleased surprise that so much had been done to honor her late spouse and other oregon veterans. this section of the chinook winds casino resort property is reserved each year for what's been dubbed as the \"field of honor,\" consisting of 1,000 american flags that serve as a reminder to all that this last week in september is reserved for the annual \"celebration of honor\" events in lincoln city. sar richards, general manager of chinook winds, led the opening ceremony events that included presentations of the oregon honorable service medal for veterans who served in world war ii, the korean, vietnam and gulf wars, as well as current local military members serving in iraq or afghanistan. \"our family members have had many sleepless nights wondering if their loved ones would return home okay,\" said richards in thanking all the hundreds of family members who accompanied the veterans to this annual event that's hosted by chinook winds casino resort and the lincoln city community. richards, who's a member of the confederated tribes of siletz indians that own chinook winds casino resort, also reminded those gathered--for this unique pre-veterans day tribute--that the generation serving today also deserves a place of honor alongside previous generations for the courage they have shown. at the same time, dozens of oregon national guardsmen - many in their early 20's--beamed with pride as the crowd both applauded their service and thanked them individually after the opening ceremony. joining richards and other casino staff and community volunteers was a special citizen who veterans of oregon call \"the heart and soul\" of this annual celebration of honor. \"i can say enough about the casino's community relations manager, teresa simmons whose done so much over the years to make this event such a success,\" said <mark>john newman</mark>, who heads the veterans of oregon program that travels throughout the state to honor veterans. celebration of honor is about never forgetting america's fallen heroes chinook winds casino resort has established itself as the \"place for veterans,\" because of this annual celebration of honor event. the casino also features a large memorial to gulf war veterans that's in front of the casino. locals in lincoln city think this patriotic out-pouring \"is strictly sincere and not any sort of advertising gimmick,\" said retired air force chief master sgt. ted logan of salem, oregon. \"i served on the air force honor guard when i was a young troop, and during my 33 years on active duty i've seen many, many tributes for our veterans. and, i'm talking arlington cemetery and the lot, but nothing has watered my eyes as much as this celebration here. i think chinook winds has really set the standard for honoring all our veterans,\" explained logan, while speaking passionately about what he witnessed during the five day tribute, sept. 22 through sept. 26. logan also said he was struck by the determination of the casino workers and community members \"who publically thanked all veterans. what they've done here is to create an atmosphere that unites all our generations of american services members .\" ted kutsch, a vietnam war veteran, concurred with logan and many others who had high praise for an event that's been called one of the largest and most comprehensive week long celebration for veterans in america today. kutsch, 72, travels each year to the \"celebration of honor\" from his home in lapine, oregon, said he joined the marines at the tender age of 16 \"so i could serve my country. i guess i couldn't hardly wait to do my service,\" he said with a spark of pride in his eyes. kutsch went on to serve nine years in the marines and then another 16 years in the oregon national guard. what logan and kutsch don't like to remember or talk about, however, is the disgraceful way americans treated military members both during and after the vietnam war. \"people would spit on me when i was wearing my uniform downtown. now, i walk around lincoln city like a hero. it sure feels nice to be here and feel that sort of love and respect from complete strangers who salute me when they see my old vietnam veteran ball cap .\" at the same time, many of the civilians who attended the \"celebration of honor\" events noted they \"could never properly thank both the veterans and their families for the sacrifices they've endured .\" but, this annual event \"gives us that opportunity and that's why it's golden,\" said <mark>michael rose</mark> who's a retired professor from nearby oregon state university. while there was plenty of american flag waving and other patriotic ceremonies, \"oregonians are more included to be focused on people. they enjoy sharing their feelings with each other, and nothing is more satisfying than something like this because it's so positive. what's better at this time in our country's history than to celebrate our heroes in uniform,\" explained <mark>rose</mark> who's

conversation at a debate i attended on january of last year. but at the same time, i was concerned that many of us christians are more concerned with labels and theological terminology rather than the object of our terminology. in other words, do we talk more about god rather than talking to god? does our theological rhetoric have any impact in our daily walk with our saviour? i purposely used the pronoun \"our\" because i have to honestly confess that i am guilty of this as well. \"theology matters!\" , as <mark>james white</mark> so eloquently puts it. every christian is a theologian in some sense. we are always learning more about the lover of our soul everyday as we fellowship with him. our theology will inevitably determine how we view god, ourselves, worship, his word, the world around us, etc. so if you don't have a sound, biblical theology and doctrine, then you will miss out on the joy of knowing jesus christ more intimately. moreover, you may end up loving someone else other than the triune god of the scriptures. i am okay with calling myself a 5 point calvinist, reformed baptist, dichotomist, etc. but these titles are meaningless if they bear no weight upon my soul. many have asked me, \"does it really matter if you are a calvinist or not?\" i would say it most certainly does! albert n. martin wrote a compelling booklet called, \"the practical implications of calvinism\" , which you can find and purchase on my recommended books page. he addresses how the doctrines of grace should have a direct affect on a christian's every day life. here is an excerpt, \"what is the personal practical effect of the confession of calvinism in the life of a man? if he sees god, it will break him, and if he understands that god saves sinners, it will make him a trustful, prayerful, watchful person pursuing practical godliness. is that what these doctrines are for you right where you sit this morning?\" (pg .23) pastor loves tattoos, but? tattoos & body
