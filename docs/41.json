(lay was also convicted but died months later of heart disease .) the court is as likely to be interested in the question that skilling's case raises about the honest services statute, which gives wide leeway for federal prosecutors to go after actions of public and private officials who deprive constituents or their employers of the \"intangible right of honest services .\" the statute has become a favorite tool in pursuing both public corruption cases as well as those involving corporate greed. in skilling's case, solicitor general elena kagan said that the law was properly applied, but also that skilling would have been convicted without it. but the law has engendered a backlash from those who say it is used too freely. one of those critics is justice antonin scalia, who criticized his colleagues earlier this year for not accepting a different case involving the statute. he said the law \"invites abuse by headline-grabbing prosecutors in pursuit of local officials, state legislators and corporate ceos who engage in any manner of unappealing or ethically questionable conduct .\" since then, the court has accepted the petition of black, who was accused of defrauding his company, hollinger international, and a former alaska legislator accused of drumming up business from a company that had dealings with the state, even though no state law appears to have been violated. the federal appeals courts have interpreted the law to cover widely divergent levels of conduct. the skilling case asks whether the law requires proof of personal gain. black's case raises the issue of whether there must be proof that the defendant knew there would be economic harm to his company. and the alaska case deals with whether a public official has violated his duty under state law. the supreme court full coverage of the u.s. supreme court, including key cases and nominations to the nation's highest court.", "articleID": "2009101402_00010694_W", "names": {"Robert

on a list of 12 troubled los angeles unified campuses that could be taken over by outside operators, its principal has quit, citing a lack of unity on campus. <mark>kevin kennedy</mark>, who has been at the school less than two years, announced friday he was taking an administrative position with local district 8, which oversees schools from gardena to san pedro. district officials said the change was motivated by the need for help in the local district office, which saw half of its staff cut under budget reductions earlier this year. kennedy wrote in a memo sent to staff friday that he made the announcement with a \"heavy heart .\" \"the school faces tremendous challenges in the coming months,\" wrote kennedy, 61. \"to succeed in meeting those challenges, a united gardena is essential. the division among us is a distraction and collaborative team work is the first element for a united gardena .\" kennedy's replacement is rudy mendoza, 46, a carson resident and an alumnus and former assistant principal of banning high in wilmington. local district 8 superintendent linda del cueto cited mendoza's \"collaborative style\" in a letter announcing the selection. the change comes to gardena high as the sprawling, nearly 3,200-student campus - among the lowest achieving secondary schools in the south bay - enters a process that could see it turned over to operation by a charter organization, gardena, along with san pedro high and 10 other lausd campuses, was placed last month on a list of \"focus schools\" that are the first batch to be subject to the public school choice plan approved by the board of education in august. under the plan, underperforming and newly constructed campuses will be up for bids from operators both inside and outside the school district. students at gardena high were expected to stage a silent protest today demonstrating their opposition to being turned into a charter, district officials said. the timing of the leadership change has some teachers worried about bringing in a new principal, even though kennedy was reportedly unpopular among some staff. \"(mendoza) has never been a principal before. this isn't to say he can't do the job, but we have a school that has literally been thrown to the dogs by district administration,\" said teacher saul lankster, referring to the school's inclusion on the \"focus schools\" list. lankster is a history teacher and chair of the gardena high chapter of united teachers los angeles, which he said is drafting a plan that would recreate the campus as a district-affiliated charter school. mendoza, who started monday, could not be reached for comment. local district officials said mendoza's experience at \"tough schools\" made him well-prepared to guide gardena through the public school choice process. the campus this year also faces a high-stakes visit by a regional academic accreditation group and the implementation of \"small learning communities,\" a districtwide program that divides high school students into themed groups. those challenges come after kennedy's tenure marked a change for gardena high, which has a predominately latino and african-american student body. after serving as an assistant principal at narbonne high, kennedy was appointed to the top job at gardena in january 2008. because of health issues, he was unable to take his position until september 2008. his tenure coincided with an edict from lausd headquarters to reduce the number of suspensions of students, district officials said. when kennedy took the job, gardena had the highest number of suspensions in the district, said local district high school director juan flecha. that had been the legacy of gardena's previous principal, russ thompson, who \"ran a tight, tight ship\" as a way to address race-based violence on campus, flecha said. thompson was promoted to an administrative position at a local district office, a fact that irritated lankster, who said he would \"follow thompson into battle .\" under kennedy, the number of suspensions dropped significantly, flecha said. \"that's been interpreted as,\" oh wow, the discipline has gone south under his reign, \"' he said. kennedy also emphasized addressing behavioral problems in the classroom, rather than kicking kids out for acting up, flecha said, adding that the policy could have caused tension with teachers. lankster characterized the changes this way:\" all hell broke loose. there was no order on this campus. there hasn't been any discipline since mr. kennedy came. \"", "articleID":

october 17, 2009 <mark>john kinsella</mark>'s case is unique in many ways. he was convicted in relation to a drugs haul in belgium, even though he was in ireland when they were seized. in addition to that, the main evidence against him were foreign wire-taps of phone conversations of him obtained by dutch police. conspiracy to import drug charges are very rare in irish courts. the case had thrown up substantial difficulties in terms of admissibility of evidence and <mark>kinsella</mark>'s right to privacy. the trial was set to be, in the words of judge <mark>tony hunt</mark>, a \"complicated, lengthy and expensive\" , involving large a number of witnesses from abroad and \"substantial\" issues of law. but, at the eleventh hour, on the day before the trial was due to begin at the dublin circuit court, <mark>kinsella</mark> changed his plea to guilty. yesterday, he received a 12-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, backdated to his detention on september 26, 2006. <mark>kinsella</mark> had little reason leading up to that date to believe that he was being monitored. as with most garda drug investigations, it began when the garda national drug unit (gndu) received information that a group of irish criminals, along with other criminals, based in spain and possibly holland, were going to be involved in bringing in a substantial amount of heroin into the country. \"officers from the gndu approached those countries,\" said a garda source. \"one of the main suspects mentioned was <mark>james rankin</mark>, who was well known to us as a criminal .\" <mark>rankin</mark> was arrested by the dutch police after the drugs were seized and was subsequently sentenced to eight years by a belgian court. after being approached by the gndu, dutch police placed an intercept on <mark>rankin</mark>'s mobile phone. \"it became apparent that <mark>rankin</mark> was in the immediate process of sending in a substantial quantity of drugs,\" said the garda source. \"he made contact with a number of irish numbers, including a number that was identified as being used by <mark>john kinsella</mark>. he was known to us. it became apparent his involvement was on the irish end .\" we're quite happy he's not the main person and that there was a mr big controlling things. \"he said the night before the seizure in belgium on september 26, <mark>rankin</mark> picked up a man, <mark>simon scott</mark> whittard, at schipol airport .\" they travelled to belgium and were under observation by the dutch. it became apparent that whittard was going to be the courier. we picked that up from conversations between <mark>rankin</mark> and <mark>kinsella</mark>. <mark>kinsella</mark> said to make sure whittard was \"suited and booted'. whittard suffered from drink problems, so that was to make sure he had a suit and a laptop .\" the source said <mark>rankin</mark> and <mark>kinsella</mark> did not mention the word drugs in their conversation, but discussed exact quantities - the same as those seized. they also discussed a \"bird in the sky\" , referring to a plane. the gndu were able to establish there was an irish plane landing at the same time whittard was due to land. he said the plane <mark>kinsella</mark> had hired from businessman jim mansfield - along with two pilots - was at wevelgem airport in belgium to transport whittard and packages back to weston aerodrome. when belgium police established the plane was due to land at weston, they arrested whittard and seized the drugs. back in ireland, the gndu arrested <mark>kinsella</mark>. \"he denied any involvement, right up to the trial and changed his plea on october 5,\" said the garda. he also said that on a practical level there was \"exceptional\" cooperation between the gndu and spanish, dutch and belgian police authorities. but he said the problems came at the judicial end. he said this had been the third attempt at a trial. initially the belgian authorities tried to extradite him, but <mark>kinsella</mark> fought that. he later changed his legal team, further delaying matters. the garda said the case was \"the most contested pre-trial case\" the gndu had ever been involved in. \"there were so many difficulties regarding evidence. the other countries have different procedures to here. we never had so many meetings with the state .\" he said the police in holland and belgium are not typically questioned in court, and some have never been in court. he said a major obstacle was the admissibility of wire-tap evidence from a foreign country. \"the issue is there is no legal constraint to using wire tap evidence from abroad here, but the law doesn't say it can be used either. the defence said it was unconstitutional until the last day .\" he said they had 35-40 dutch prosecution people, including magistrates and police, to give evidence. the prosecution also had on hand a voice expert. judge <mark>hunt</mark> referred to the legal points yesterday, much of it around the wire-tap evidence. he said the right to privacy - as had been argued by the defence - did give way to other rights, including the right of public interest in investigating serious wrongdoing. he said the \"democratically expressed policy\" in ireland now was that wire-tap evidence was accepted. garda\u00ed do not believe this was <mark>kinsella</mark>'s first operation, due to the massive size of the haul and the sophistication of the operation. the situation could get worse for <mark>kinsella</mark>. at the end of yesterday's sentencing, the court set a date for a confiscation order hearing. under the criminal justice act 1994, a court can, in a case where a person is convicted of a drug trafficking offence, make a confiscation order requiring the person to pay an amount equal to what he accrued from drug trafficking. <mark>kinsella</mark> has a property in thailand, a number of bank accounts and the plush family home in navan, once valued at more than \u20ac 1 million. this story appeared in the printed version of the irish examiner saturday, october 17, 2009 seems that you don't have adobe flash installed.", "articleID":
