a minority offshoot of the shi'a, as are the arabs of hizbullah in lebanon and the non-arab mullahs of iran - falls to the dominant sunni islamist parties who are leading the revolt, like those which toppled mubarak in egypt and other despots in adjacent countries, please consider the following episode. when kurds in qamishli rose up against assad and the arabist ba \"th in the spring of 2004 and were slaughtered, syrian arabs of all stripes remained quiet. there was no mention of the kurds' courage in confronting the brutality and repression of the regime, their revolt was condemned, and they were accused of being mere separatists. new york times columnist, thomas friedman, can also only manage to call some 35 million truly stateless kurds by that same separatist word, while repeatedly lionizing the arabs' quest for a 22nd state alongside, or instead of, israel. it's that same old subjugating arab mindset - again, and again, and again. in the arabs' own words, the whole region is simply viewed as\" purely arab patrimony \"- and to hell with everyone else who dares to protest, be they millions of copts, imazighen/berbers, black african sudanese, kurds, assyrians, native kilab yahud (\"jew dogs\" ), or whomever. here is how this concept is proclaimed in syria's ba \"thist arab constitution - an idea espoused by sunni arabs now seeking to topple alawi arabs at least as much - and probably more - than the latter: the so-called arab\" fatherland \"belongs solely to the arabs. they alone have the right to direct its destinies. the arab\" fatherland \"is that part of the globe inhabited by the arab nation which stretches from the taurus mountains, the pacht-i-kouh mountains, the gulf of basra, the arab ocean, the ethiopian mountains, the sahara, the atlantic ocean, and the mediterranean sea. now, in case you think that things have changed in light of recent events, please consider that over the past months when the syrian opposition held many conferences to draw up a plan for syria's future, kurds attended as well. for the most part, they were totally ignored-even by the american state department, an apparent fan of islamists of most stripes. reports stated, for example, that during the opposition conference in istanbul in mid-july 2011, the kurdish demand that kurds be recognized as a second ethnic group in syria simply fell on deaf ears. the kurds' second demand - to rename the syrian arab republic to simply the republic of syria-angered many opposition leaders who interpreted the kurdish suggestion as a plan to strip syria of its\" true \"(i.e., arab) identity. compounding the kurds' arab problem is the fact that the main arab opposition parties in syria are primarily supported by like-minded anti-kurdish islamist parties in turkey and those assorted arabian peninsula sunni arabs mentioned above. as usual, the kurds will likely be used and abused yet again by all parties involved - including their own leaders. in neighboring iraq, for example, the kurdish regional government has its own hands full playing a balancing act with iran, ankara, and so forth and so has not really been constructive in helping out its syrian kurdish brethren. add to this the problems with the militant pkk bogeyman (which would not even exist if kurds had been afforded basic human, let alone political, rights) - and the legitimate aspirations for freedom and autonomy of kurds and other non-arab peoples in a future syria appear distant indeed. the main problem is that when it comes to what\" democracy \"would likely look like, the weight of the evidence does not look good for a post-assad syria. too many syrian opposition leaders fighting the assad regime appear to adhere to concepts and policies similar to those of assad or any of syria's earlier arab dictators. and those wanting something better (like the sdc) are being ignored by the powers that be elsewhere. denise natali, of the institute for national strategic studies (inss) at national defense university, wrote a uselful analysis regarding a series of meetings in qatar dealing with this very issue while a turk/arab more preferred sunni regime would replace the alawis, non-arabs such as kurds or assyrians in syria will have no more to look forward to with it than egypt's non-arab copts now do. all have a history of being subjugated and ruthlessly massacred by their arab neighbors. the ba\" th in neighboring sunni arab saddam's iraq killed hundreds of thousands of kurds over the years as well, both before and during the anfal campaign of the '80s. while there may be more liberal voices in both egypt and syria, the power lies elsewhere and those wielding it will likely be no more tolerant (probably less) than the regimes which they toppled. having said this, recent events in egypt--where the muslim brotherhood is encountering increasing opposition to its subjugating agenda--are a pleasant surprise. to say that the situation is a tinderbox is an understatement, but those hoping that the powerful military will intervene are probably in for a rude awakening. there seems to have been a trade-off made between the ikhwan and the officers--one which safeguards the latters' extensive economic interests in particular. so, forget about a coup toppling president morsi--especially since more of the officer corps these days have links themselves to the muslim brotherhood. now, some may say that since democracy is so new in that region of the world (with the exception of the nation almost everyone loves to vilify), it must be given time to evolve. fair enough. america's own democracy needed time too. but, the problem with this line of thought is that the ability to evolve into something better requires a tolerance of diversity for \"the other\" , almost entirely missing from the dominant, age-old subjugating arab mindset--despite claims to the contrary, the \"golden age of spain,\" and so forth. perhaps egypt's best known copt, dr. boutros boutros-ghali, president sadat's foreign minister, summed this up best when he met israeli author, amos elon. in elon's \"flight into egypt\" (new york, 1980, pp. 84-91), he reviewed his encounter with boutros-ghali. here's some excerpts: in his office, there is a map of the middle east on which israel is still blacked out. israel must integrate by accepting the nature of the area--that nature that is arab. in a tape of a long discourse delivered in 1975 to professor brecher he proclaimed that in the vast area between the persian gulf and the atlantic ocean everyone had to be arab or risk continuing strife. still, boutros-ghali felt that there might be a solution. how? well, israel could become an arab country. most israelis were (jewish) immigrants from arab countries anyway. whether a copt in egypt, kabyle/amazigh (\"berber\" ) in north africa, jew, kurd, or whomever, the only way for non-arabs to be tolerated is for them to accept the arab rules of the game (whether their arab masters are sunni or shi'a) and turn themselves into \"uncle tom\" uncle boutroses. all have to accept forced arabization, to one degree or another. the problem is really two-fold here - having both religious and racist dimensions - and committed by the same people who lecture about allegedly racist zionism. you see, unlike the non-arab christian copts or assyrians, the non-arab \"berbers,\" kurds, black africans in darfur, and others are indeed muslim--but not arab. whether sunni or shi'a, and no matter how often the former blow each other apart, arabs won't tolerate what they call \"another israel\" being born in what they claim as \"purely arab patrimony .\" left up to them, they won't even tolerate anything which might be seen as steps in that direction--such as a federal syria with autonomous kurdish and other non-arab areas. that which exists in iraq today in the krg, courtesy of america's overthrow of saddam, is becoming under increasing threat daily from the dominant shi'a arabs now in control in baghdad. the oil of the millennia-old kurdish heartland in kirkuk is the current flashpoint. what must also be remembered is that up until very recently, for a variety of reasons, washington and others have largely turned a blind eye to the numerous atrocities committed by the syrian regime-whether they were directed against lebanon's quest for freedom, israel's jews, native kurds, native sunni arabs in the elder assad's infamous \"hama solution,\" or whomever. indeed, despite all of the above, israel was repeatedly offered up on a silver platter to the syrians in exchange for just a bit more cooperation in lebanon and in iraq. there were active plans to force israel into a total retreat from the strategic golan heights which israel took, at great cost, after it was forced to fight - largely due to syrian instigation and machinations - in the june '67 war. prior to that time, the heights (part of the original 1920 mandate of palestine) were used by syria to bombard israeli fishermen and farmers repeatedly. since that war, israel has repeatedly offered to exchange the vast majority of the land for true peace - something the arabs have rejected. as usual, the latter expect that their repeated aggression will come totally cost free. that territory has indeed frequently changed hands all over the globe due to such aggression. early in president obama's administration, he sent his good friend and arafat's bosom buddy, robert malley, to the younger assad with the same offer president george h. w. bush's secretary of state, <mark>james baker</mark> iii, offered to his father--a complete israeli withdrawal from the heights in return for some nice gestures towards america and others, but not israel. what's even more disturbing is that, with all that has recently transpired during the so-called \"arab spring\" (and the uncertainty and instability inherent in these events), the american state department will still expect that the jews will expose themselves yet again tp such arab despots or alleged arab islamist jihadi \"democrats .\" even worse, the man now occupying the white house is on record repeatedly stating the israel would be crazy (his exact words) not to accept the saudi peace plan, the basis of the current non-negotiations. among other things, that saudi \"peace\" (of the grave) plan calls for a total withdrawal by israel to its pre - '67 armistice lines (not borders) which made it a mere 9-15 miles wide at its strategic waist-where the vast majority of its population lives. most people travel further than that just to go to work. the final draft of unsc resolution 242, the main post - '67 tool for peacemaking, specifically does not call upon israel to do this, as has often been noted elsewhere. so, i have mixed feelings about what is now transpiring in syria. if replacing secular butchers with jihadi ones instead is the choice, thanks but no thanks. one part of me wants to see the bloodshed stopped; but, my other consciousness warns that those now in revolt will be no better to their own perceived enemies than those whom they seek to replace. one set of massacres and victims will simply be replaced by another. and, if anything, as with what is evolving in egypt and elsewhere in the region, what and who will likely replace the reigning despot in syria (is there any other type of ruler in the \"arab\" world?) will only prove to be even more hostile to jews, kurds, assyrian christians, and scores of millions of other non-arab peoples in the region. having stated all of this, it is true that another argument could be made for severing iran's link to its hizbullah proxies-who have all but taken over lebanon and who have scores of thousands of missiles aimed at israel from just a bit over the border-by toppling the regime in syria which serves as the primary middle man for such aid. the problem, however, is that, depite that relative good news, once again, the devil which will replace assad will very likely be as bad or worse than the current regime itself when it comes to israel, kurds, true democracy western style, and so forth. and yet, it does not necessarily have to be this way. if washington and others can finally muster what it takes to support the truly more inclusive and tolerant elements of the syrian opposition--like those in the syrian democratic coalition of sherkoh abbas's folks--a much brighter future for syria and all of its neighbors could emerge when the dust finally settles. those who still seek to suppress the human and political rights of others may not like this development (such as turks who still refuse to call kurds \"kurds,\" but rename them \"mountain turks\" instead), but the cause of freedom cannot be held captive to such folks. while most arabs distrust iranian shi'a connections with the offshoot syrian arab alawi and the lebanese arab shi'a hizbullah (hence their support of assad's foes), there is no doubt that sunni arab attitudes towards the issue of non-arab rights in the region are, for the most part, as bad or worse. hamas and the muslim brotherhood are sunni, for example-and all call for the death of israel and the slaughter of jews. the butchers of kurds during the arabs' anfal campaign in iraq in the '80s were sunnis. ditto for most of the arab genocidal maniacs in the sudan. and so forth. again, using egypt as the model, the same islamists now in control there, from whom the hamas rulers of gaza earlier sprung, will likely be calling the shots (both figuratively and literally) in a post-assad syria."}, {"articleID": "2020020309_00057821_W", "names": {"Tommy Lee Jones": ["Q170587", "Q7819623"], "George Gallo": ["Q2075917", "Q30121962"]}, "date": "2020-02-03", "url": "http://hardware.itbusinessnet.com/2020/02/how-kate-katzman-found-her-true-calling-in-acting/", "content": "UTICA, MI / ACCESSWIRE / February 3, 2020 / How do you find your life's true calling? What do you want to achieve in life? While some people say career counseling is the way to, others recommend looking within. The fact is that the real answer comes from the inside. Most successful people introspect and even \"talk\" to themselves to get answers. It is only by doing you realize your potential, which in itself becomes a way of life. This is how actress Kate Katzman found her true calling. What started as a fun activity for Kate Katzman turned into a passion. Kate decided to try her luck in acting and enrolled in the prestigious Burt Reynolds Institute for Film and Theatre in Jupiter, Florida. She was trained by the superstar himself, who gave an immense boost to her confidence. After completing her master class, she went on to appear in numerous movies, including \"Walk Before Mickey', where she played Walt Disney's wife, Lillian. In 2019, she was also seen in\" Santa in Training' and \"A Christmas Carol .' This year, Katzman will be seen in\" Adverse,' a neo-noir film starring an ensemble cast of Mickey Rourke, Penelope Ann Miller, and Lou Diamond Phillips, among many more. Furthermore, she will also share the screen with Hollywood legends Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and <mark>Tommy Lee Jones</mark> in the comedy film \"The Comeback Trail' directed by <mark>George Gallo</mark>. When asked about her projects in 2020, Kate replied,\" It was quite an experience rubbing shoulders and keeping up with the big boys in Hollywood. It has been exhilarating and enjoyable while learning a lot more about the craft \". Kate shuffles between Palm Beach County, Florida, and Bucks County, Pennsylvania, with her husband and two children. Just like Kate Katzman, all need to find their life's true calling. Some have the fire in them but not enough to do something about it. While some don't hesitate to change their paths, but sure it's worth the effort in the end.

And the crowded GOP field now includes 11 candidates, while Democrats have four hopefuls in the race. For Republicans especially, the pressure is on to make the most of their nascent campaigns to make it into the first presidential debate, which is a mere 52 days away on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. \"Everyone's starting their engines and deciding they're going to have to make this push now,\" said national GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. There has been little drama this cycle with the will-they-or-won \"t-they game. Virtually everyone who has been toying with a White House run has pulled the trigger. Only Govs. <mark>Scott Walker</mark>, Wisconsin; Chris Christie, New Jersey; Bobby Jindal, Louisiana; and John Kasich, Ohio, are left. <mark>Walker</mark> is reportedly eyeing an official announcement the second week of July, after his state's budget deadline, while Jindal is set to announce next June 24. Christie continues to give signs that he is getting in, while Kasich has started to build a team in the early states and hired top-name consultants. Some of the candidates who got in early have all gotten bounces. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who announced nearly three months ago, saw his stock rise, especially in Iowa, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saw a marked uptick in early states and nationally. Meanwhile, despite good reviews, other candidates - including former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Gov. Rick Perry - are still lagging in the polls and face the real threat of being left off the first debate stage. Fox News has decided they are limiting the event to the top 10 candidates in an average of the most recent national polls, though last week they bowed to pressure and will host a forum earlier that day for candidates who don't make the cut. Monday, all eyes were on Bush, as he officially launched his presidential campaign. Though he was one of the first to confirm in December he was\" actively exploring \"a bid - and he has so many establishment advantages of money and organization - his unofficial campaigning over the past few months has been unable to put any space between him and the rest of the field. He hopes his official campaign announcement can be something of a reset .\" I will take nothing and no one for granted, \"he said Monday in Miami at his kickoff .\" I will run with heart. I will run to win. \"While the past two nominating cycles have seen the GOP establishment favorite eventually take the nomination, strategists warn that this cycle there's now no clear front-runner .\" He's the one with the hardest task, \"said Ford O'Connell, who worked for the Arizona senator's 2008 campaign .\" Unlike previous establishment folks like [John] McCain and [Mitt] Romney, the one thing he faces they didn't is a very challenging field. \"After missteps and concern from conservatives over his positions on immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, Bush is near the top of the pack Iowa. Another big question will be answered on Tuesday - what will <mark>Donald Trump</mark> do? After flirting with presidential runs for years - and trying to psych out the press - the reality TV star and business mogul keeps talking like he's really taking the plunge this year. If that does happen, he could push other candidates off the debate stage, too, since he's currently polling ninth nationally. The field could see another aftershock if Kasich does jump in. But the Ohio governor could face the curse of other candidates who have waited too long to officially announce - Perry waited until August 2011 last time and never gained traction, while in 2008, then-Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson's long-awaited candidacy flopped .\" A lot of people don't understand that running for president looks real easy from the cheap seats but it's a lot different from the ground, \"said O'Connell."}, {"articleID": "2009042210_00054938_W", "names": {"Stephen A.

Three navy warships and two coast guard patrol boats took on the migrants in the Mediterranean and they were then transferred to other vessels and taken to ports in Sicily, the navy said in a statement. In Geneva, the UN refugee agency UNHCR estimated 6 000 people had been rescued by the Italian navy from over 40 overcrowded boats in the past four days. UNHCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming said the migrants had set off from northern Libya \"and many were fleeing violence, conflict and persecution\". \"Main countries of origin include Syria, Eritrea, Somalia, Nigeria, Gambia, Mali and Senegal,\" she said. Syrians made up the highest number landing in Italy in 2013 with over 11 300 arrivals reported. The anti-immigration Northern League, a small but vociferous opposition party, has called for migrants to be sent back and, along with a series of far-right parties, accuses the government of failing to act. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has appealed for more assistance from the European Union but migrant rights campaigners say the real fault is with failures in Italy's immigration and asylum system. 24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our Alcohol killed my mother A young woman shares her pain of growing up with an alcoholic mother.

(AP Photo/Adam Hunger) New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley got his team's fanbase excited Sunday with an optimistic tweet. \"I'll be back soon....\" reads the post, which also included smirking and fingers crossed emojis. Barkley was moving around during Giants practice Monday morning after he'd participated in limited fashion last week. Recovering from a high ankle sprain that was projected to keep him out six to eight weeks, Barkley is teasing that his return could come Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, which would be just four weeks since the injury. \"He's got to handle practice well and be ready to play,\" Giants coach Pat Shurmur said Monday to New York area reporters, including NJ.com. \"He practiced today, so we'll see when he comes in tomorrow, how he feels .\" But Barkley isn't the only New York offensive player who hopes to return, giving rookie quarterback <mark>Daniel Jones</mark> an injection of talent. <mark>Daniel Jones</mark> hands off to Saquon Barkley pic.twitter.com/p2ggHeOWHx--Art Stapleton (@ art_stapleton) October 14, 2019 Related Links K1 Podcast: Murray and Kingsbury continue growing vs. Falcons Cardinals CB <mark>Patrick Peterson</mark> tweets he's clocking in Monday Cardinals' Maxx Williams latest Fitz victim after scoring touchdown Tight end Evan Engram told reporters he is \"pretty optimistic\" he can return from a knee injury against the Cardinals. Receiver Sterling Shepard, who suffered two concussions this year about a month apart, remains in the NFL's concussion assessment protocol, reports NJ.com. Shepard, who has 25 catches for 267 yards in four games played this season, was able to go through light workouts on Monday. Also under watch for concussion symptoms is running back Wayne Gallman, Barkley's backup. Gallman didn't play last week. Instead, undrafted rookie Jon Hilliman took 11 carries for 38 yards Thursday in a 35-14 loss to the New England Patriots but fumbled once. He has since been cut. Over the weekend, New York signed former Ravens running back Buck Allen, who could potentially play depending on the availability of Barkley and Gallman. The Giants will be pleased if any of the injured offensive players can make a return. <mark>Jones</mark> went 15-of-31 for 161 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions last week against the Patriots. The sixth overall pick's top target was veteran receiver Golden Tate, who caught six balls for 102 yards and a score. Rookie fifth-round pick Darius Slayton and tight end Rhett Ellison were the only other two Giants who received more than two targets. They each had three catches.
