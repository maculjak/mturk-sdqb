their seventh district game in a row, the west florida high softball players couldn't help but celebrate on thursday. after all, the team is having its best season in school history. the jaguars locked up the district 1-4a regular season championship and the top spot in next month's district tournament with a 9-6 defeat of choctawhatchee. the win makes the jaguars 13-4 overall. afterward, the players huddled together to sing queen's \"we are the champions .\" \"it's pretty amazing,\" said west florida shortstop kiana rosario, who was honored before the game during the senior night celebration. \"i didn't really expect us to have this good of a season, but it feels really good .\" the jaguars play again when they host district opponent gulf breeze at 7 p.m. tuesday. rosario is the jaguars' lone senior and helped lift the team from the plate, going 2 for 3 with two rbi, two runs and a triple. lauren noski also did well at bat with two hits, a triple, an rbi and three runs scored. \"the girls at the plate were definitely key for us tonight,\" said first-year west florida coach sophie gill. \"we had some good at-bats tonight. we didn't chase them. we stayed in the zone, and we got it in there and ripped it .\" with the game tied 1-1 after two innings, west florida scored four runs in the third to take its second lead. noski and kaitlyn kenfield each ripped singles to get on base. freshman pitcher <mark>jessica</mark> briggs then hit a double that brought in noski. kiana rosario then came through with an rbi single that scored kenfield and briggs. with two outs, sophomore kayla rosario hit a double that scored her older sister. the next big inning for the jaguars came in the sixth. noski got things started with a triple to right-center field that brought in brittany atkinson. kiana rosario then added another triple to bring in noski. kiana rosario scored her second run of the game when kailina kenfield lined a single to right field. \"this is the best record they've ever had ever,\" jaguars assistant coach <mark>jessica smith</mark> said. \"i am just so proud of these girls .\" briggs threw all seven innings, gave up just one walk and struck out six indians. choctawhatchee pitcher michelle eubanks threw six innings with no strikeouts and three walks. the indians tried to put together a rally in the seventh after kierstyn denny hit a two-out, three-rbi double to give the game its final score. at west florida: west florida 9, choctawhatchee 6 choctawhatchee 010 200 3-6 7 1 west florida (13-4) 104 103 x-9 11 3 wp-jessica briggs 7 ip, 6 r, 7

"content": "smaller type by tracie cone, the associated press lemoore, calif. - cash-strapped farmers in california's agricultural heartland and environmentalists at odds over water rights and wildlife protections finally agree on something: that thousands of acres of cracked, salty farmland is the perfect site for a sprawling utility-scale solar farm. the 47 square-miles of land proposed for the westlands solar park in remote kings and fresno counties is just one of dozens of unfinished solar projects in california, but renewable energy analysts say it is a rare one that enjoys the broad support of environmental groups such as the sierra club, powerful agriculture interests and state government. thousands of solar panels would be located on and near the salty-white, fallowed farm land, most of which is owned by the westlands water district, the largest such district in the country comprised of 600,000 acres of san joaquin valley farmland. once completed, the first chunk of solar proposed for the site - the total size of which is roughly that of san francisco - could generate up to 1 gigawatt of power, or enough to energize up to one million homes. \"i think a better fit (for the land) is farming, but we have what we have and you go from there,\" westlands spokesman sarah woolf said. the embrace of solar power as a new cash crop comes at a time when the district is struggling with mounting debt. a decade ago, westlands floated a bond to buy 100,000 acres of farm land where poor drainage had created a salt buildup called selenium, making the land unusable for growers. but with the salty land came water rights, so westlands bought it so it could divert the water allocations to more productive farms. since then, drought and environmental issues have cut revenue to westlands by reducing the amount of water it can sell to members, who range from corporate giant harris farms to family farming operations. over the past two years, westlands has tripled farmers' assessmentsto repay bonds when they can least afford it. westlands now sees solar power as a way to put the land back to work. \"(solar is) a natural fit, it works,\" woolf said. \"but the underlying motivation is we need to figure out a way to repay the debt .\" now, with mojave desert solar projects shrinking in number because of recent proposed legislation by u.s. sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., that would create two new national monuments there, woolf said the valley has become \"the prime location for solar .\" the district has said it is also open to other types of energy development, including nuclear. environmentalists like the site for solar panels because it had been intensively farmed for decades, so it does not contain habitat for endangered species, an issue that has stalled projects in the sunnier mojave. \"in this part of the world it's not often you find common ground between the water district, landowners and environmentalists, and this is a project that seems to have this potential,\" <mark>barry nelson</mark>, senior policy analyst at the natural resources defense council, said. another plus is the project's proximity to transmission lines and substations that could deliver energy produced at the site to homes throughout the state, said daniel kim, principal partner at westside holdings, the private investment group that has a lease contract with westlands and neighboring farmers. also, as utilities seek renewable energy to meet the state's goal of getting one-third of its power from renewable sources by 2020, the california energy commission has identified a number of zones where large-scale projects can be developed. the land that would be used by westlands solar park is included in these identified areas, which means some regulatory hurdles already have been met. despite the positive reaction to the project from disparate groups, the solar park has a number of hurdles to overcome, including getting through the regulatory hurdles associated with getting built new power lines and substations that will be needed to deliver the power. kim's group is working on negotiations with utility companies, who would need to build the transmission infrastructure upgrades before the site's potential can be realized. still, renewable energy experts say the project is promising, partly because landowner westlands is a public agency operating under state authority, so many of the regulatory issues bogging down other large-scale solar projects do not apply. the path to the finish line is more clearly defined here than perhaps any other project in the state right now, said carl zichella, sierra club's director of western renewable programs. \"this particular idea of using retired agricultural land for large scale renewable energy development...has a lot of interest,\" he said. despite the area's sun potential, large-scale solar projects had largely failed to gain traction in the san joaquin valley because of westlands' disinterest and a focus by developers on the more sunny mojave. \"the whole idea of farmers letting go of these farms is not easy,\" kim said. \"when you're a third generation farmer, it's not a decision taken lightly .\" but with the more sunny desert sites mired in a political, regulatory and environmental morass, the valley's solar value has increased. \"lo and behold, three years later (desert sites) are far less desirable because the desert has tremendous ecological diversity and a lot of stake holders who don't want to see desert with a lot of solar panels,\" kim said. entering them helps digitize old texts.", "articleID": "2010032118_00112817_W", "names": {"Barry Nelson": ["Q3635239", "Q4864560"]}}, {"date": "2010-03-21", "url":

just as shaky a deep ball as orton, and has played in a \"variant\" of this system, but not this system. he's a cast off from cleveland. period. quinn will be a good backup. if he evolves to be some amazing starter and helps us win games, well then glory be! but right now, he's just a dude who has not lived up to the hype. there are plenty of better stories this offseason. like some of the other readers here, i am really excited to see what martindale can do with the defense. i'm likining what i'm seeing, and would love to see us develop depth at the d-line where we have traditionally ran

that there might be a quarterback competition between two has beens who never were, kyle orton and brady quinn. virtually everywhere else in the nfl save perhaps oakland you would be laughed at if given these two choices. lets put this in perspective, if rex grossman can beat out kyle orton, why couldnt quinn? heres a quote from josh last march. \"he's our quarterback and - and - we will always

it's really hard to say whether or not mcdaniels' public praise of orton is genuine or not. listening to troy aikman during the dallas/denver game last year, orton is a fantastic practice player...makes all the throws, makes all the right reads, good rhythm. but that is not translating to game day. it makes a big difference when a 260 pound man with 4.6 speed is running at you with intent to do great bodily harm...and you've got to stand there, make your reads and make an accurate throw right before that animal turns you into a tackling dummy. the last thing a head coach wants to do is bury his starting qb verbally in the media (although apparently it's okay to do it to your 2 time pro bowl wr) even if he doesn't believe his qb is great. last year, i was clamoring for son of simms to get some snaps. when he did, i was clamoring for them to put orton back in...there was no competition at the qb position because son of simms was zero competition and tater was a puppy. but i've gotta believe that deep down, mcd knows orton is not gonna go moses for bronco nation and lead us to the promise land. however, that's the option he's looking at right now and the last thing he wants to do is destroy the confidence of a guy who, let's be honest, doesn't exude the swagger of an upper echelon nfl qb but if he improves in a lot of areas can allow our playmakers (royal,

(click here) news | home washington, march 24 / prnewswire-usnewswire /--associated builders and contractors (abc) today reports that its construction backlog indicator (cbi) sharply declined by 9 percent between november 2009 and january 2010. cbi has slipped 16.3 percent during the last year and currently stands at 5.5 months, the lowest point reported in the 15 months abc has gathered data. cbi is a forward-looking indicator that measures the amount of construction work under contract to be completed in the future. \"the fact that the cbi is now at its lowest point since abc began measuring the statistic in november 2008 indicates that the nation's nonresidential construction industry remains mired in its own recession,\" said abc chief economist <mark>anirban basu</mark>. \"nonresidential construction tends to lag the overall economy by 12 to 24 months. with the broader economy having been in a slow recovery for roughly three quarters, and with the stimulus package still having an impact, the hope had been that some signs of backlog stability would be apparent by now. however, all indications continue to point toward an ongoing decline in the commercial and industrial construction industry .\" regional highlights between january 2009 and january 2010, average backlog was down in each of the geographic regions, except for the middle states. particularly sharp declines occurred in the northeast and the south, which have both experienced declines of roughly half a month of backlog during the past two months. the sharpest regional decline occurred in the south, falling from 8.12 months in january 2009 to 6.03 months in january 2010. analysis \"while most regions experienced a decline in average backlog during the latest two-month period, with the exception of the middle states, the pace of decline was quite modest. overall, the data are consistent with the notion that while the pace of decline continues to slow, the downward trend is evident in virtually every region of the nation .\" industry highlights the average backlog fell in all three industry segments? commercial, industrial and infrastructure? between january 2009 and january 2010. between november 2009 and january 2010, average backlog in the infrastructure category fell by precisely two months. at 5.3 months, backlog in the commercial and institutional category now stands at its lowest level in the survey's history. analysis \"the data indicate that infrastructure-related work, attributable to the stimulus package passed in february 2009, is no longer generating substantial new backlog now that the funds have largely been obligated to current projects under way. the elevated backlog readings of previous months are associated with substantial levels of ongoing construction, but the decline in backlog signals an eventual downturn in infrastructure-related construction spending .\" highlights by company size with the exception of firms in the $30 million to $50 million category, average backlog declined for every size category. no firm in the $75 million to $100 million category reported an average backlog of more than five months, and many reported backlog between three and four months. firms with annual revenues in excess of $100 million reported the lengthiest backlog, although backlog for this group has been declining overall in recent months. analysis \"average backlog is now at its lowest level in both the $50 million to $75 million and the $75 million to $100 million categories. many of these firms appear to be general contractors that continue to be underbid by larger firms with greater resources and greater capacity to undertake projects with little or no profit margin built into their bids. larger firms also may be more likely to maintain productive banking relationships, allowing them to more nimbly access available contractual opportunities .\" to read more about the latest cbi, click here. associated

end children's program joseph schmidt march 24, 2010 at 7:21 pm the fate and funds of a state agency for early childhood development is in the hands of arizona voters this november, and legislators say those funds are necessary to combat the budget crisis. since the 2006 passing of proposition 203, first things first has received more than $480 million from the imposed 80-cent tax increase on cigarettes. two-thirds of those funds sit unspent - money some legislators say could be better utilized elsewhere. however, legislators can't just redirect those funds toward whatever means they wish. they must obtain voters' permission. \"basically, voters chose to create first things first,\" said kristin borns, senior analyst for the morrison institute for public policy. \"by doing that, they generated a funding source just for that agency and passed that by ballot .\" this means that if legislators want to eliminate first things first and transfer its funds into the general fund, the residents of arizona have to vote on the issue. rhian evans allvin, first things first executive director, said voters dedicated this money toward early childhood development and education because it's an important issue. \"it is wrong for the legislature to try and steal money that was set aside by voters,\" allvin said. \"this was money that was never part of the general fund, and was not a cause of the budget crisis .\" reps. <mark>john kavanagh</mark>, r-fountain hills, and rich crandall, r-mesa, both said the money from first things first could be better applied. \"first things first has identified a tax stream for zero-to-5-year-olds - would it be better if that stream could benefit not only them but 6-to-65-year-olds as well?\" crandall said. the money from first things first would be used to finance state-funded programs that are in trouble because of the budget crisis, <mark>kavanagh</mark> said. \"we will be using the money for early childhood programs, like health care and disease screening,\" he said. \"we have a massive shortfall and it's getting worse. to allow hundreds of millions of dollars to sit idly...while we're having to cut vital services makes no sense .\" allvin said there are misconceptions about first things first processes and how they distribute funds. \"on one hand, we're accused of being reckless. the other hand, we're too slow and bureaucratic,\" she said. \"one, we're thorough. we won't stop being thorough. two, the fund balance we have is an intended fund balance .\" allvin said the organization is collecting money in anticipation of a declining revenue stream from the tobacco tax, which has gone down in recent years. that money will be used for long-term goals of the organization. \"to start to be able to prove that young children have different outcomes because of the investments, that's going to take a while,\" allvin said. though legislators have been critical of first things first in the past, crandall recently said they're \"doing good work, good mission,\" while <mark>kavanagh</mark> said it was \"an ambitious, beneficial program when it was introduced .\" however, both men urged voters to eliminate the program. \"there's need-to-have and nice-to-have,\" <mark>kavanagh</mark> said. \"it doesn't make much sense to have the nice-to-haves when your needs are getting cut .\" first things first has offered to loan the state $260 million, and then $300 million, but those offers have been declined. allvin said he will continue to pursue an alternative solution with the legislature. \"we acknowledge there's a huge crisis, and that these are different times than they were,\" allvin said. phoenix mayor <mark>phil gordon</mark> was a proponent of proposition 203 in 2006 and said he continues to support first things first. \"his position has not changed,\" said david leibowitz, spokesman for the mayor. \"it was a good idea in its inception and it remains a good idea today .\" he understands the state is in a difficult position, but the mayor is still of the opinion that protecting children is a \"worthwhile endeavor,\" leibowitz said. \"you take the money out of first things first and put it into the general fund, you will create a set of problems...that you'll need to solve with general fund money,\" he said. \"that money is earmarked for serious problems .\" the issue,
