but as an artist, he exhorts people to question these routes and rules rather than accept them without thinking.\" life is a kind of stamped contract since the time you are born. you have religion, it's a contract. you have a wife, it's a contract; and between countries there is a contract for trading. but i want people to think about every contract and choice they make in life and to not be misdirected into having a false sense of security regarding certain materials and ideas. ultimately i want to question whether we as individuals, as cultures, as societies are following the right path or whether we should trust in a path at all, \"gharem says. while gharem's message is subtle, braithwaite's work is direct and in-your-face. the young artist is fascinated with the middle east. in 2002, he joined off screen, a group of european artists who travelled in the region holding art workshops and joint exhibitions with local artists. he thus has a good understanding of the middle eastern ethos and thinking. he uses it to confront western stereotypes and biased views and tries to present a balanced perspective on contemporary issues through his art. his latest work, titled hall of mirrors, is a playful and profound statement on the realignment of power in the 21st century. it includes a series of portraits of political leaders and other iconic figures from the middle east. the artist has used the 18th-century eglomise technique to etch the portraits behind mirrors. rather than firm lines, his portraits are composed of childish scrawls made with crayons, marker pens and pencils. but the scratchy mirror paintings are framed in antique gilt frames from the height of europe's imperial past. the rich, ornate frames, sourced from auctions and antique dealers, remind you of paintings of royalty seen in european palaces and manors. but the grand oil paintings of those emperors and generals of the past have been swapped with braithwaite's na\u00efve, airy portraits of personalities such as muammar gaddafi, ayatollah khomeini, reza shah pahlavi, caliph ali ibn abu talib, haifa wehbe, osama bin laden and <mark>saddam hussain</mark>. the artist describes this quirky juxtaposition of the orient and occident, old and new, and ornate and sketchy as\" reverse colonisation \". allusion to regime change\" the world is changing rapidly and people are torn by a conflicting sense of identity and responsibility on issues ranging from climate change to the war on terror. this series comments on the changing reality and our struggle to reconcile the past with present geopolitical situations. showing these antique european frames occupied by middle eastern power barons is an experiment in regime change. europe has a history of colonisation and by recolonising history, i am trying to restore the balance and relieve postcolonial stress by shearing off some of the west's tentacles and puncturing european vanity, \"braithwaite says.\" i used mirrors because i wanted the message to be direct and in-your-face. quite literally, this work holds up a mirror to society to see how it looks and feels when daoud successfully slingshots a piece of rubble into the eye of goliath. \"email a friend emailing an article to friend is a simple way to share a news item. your friend will receive an email with your name and email address as well any personal message you choose to send. the information you provide on this page will not be used to send unsolicited emails."}, {"articleID": "2013100401_00013085_W", "names": {"Steven A.

Cohen</mark>'s hedge fund Citigroup analyst Kevin Chang emailed unpublished research about Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, a major supplier of Apple Inc iPhones, to SAC, GLG Partners, according to William Galvin, Massachusetts' Secretary of the Commonwealth. Apple's iPhones in the first quarter of 2013, which would have had a detrimental effect on Apple, the regulator said. SAC, hedge fund Citadel and mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price all sold Apple stock after receiving the information from Chang, a complaint filed by Galvin's office alleges. At $30 million, the Massachusetts fine is both one of the biggest state securities regulators have ever collected and 15 times the $2 million they fined Citi for improperly disclosing research on Facebook's initial public offering only a year ago. Galvin said the fine is so high because the case came less than one year after the Facebook case and illustrates that aspects of Citi's supervisory culture failed. \"The Citi analyst should not have been that accessible to the clients, he should have been better protected by the compliance team,\" Galvin added. Galvin's office had filed civil charges against Citi for \"failing to supervise\" , and the $30 million fine is the result of a settlement, he said. No criminal charges were filed. A spokeswoman for Citi said the bank takes \"regulatory compliance requirements very seriously and train (s) all of our employees about these obligations.\" She declined to give further details about the case. Chang, who worked for Citi in Taiwan, was terminated last month, the complaint said. The Massachusetts settlement also offers new details about how SAC employees worked at a time the $14 billion hedge fund has come under increased scrutiny about its trading practices. The insider trading charges against SAC in July. The hedge fund said it has done nothing wrong and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Galvin said he would be happy to cooperate with federal or other state authorities probing SAC. \"The emails between Kevin Chang and the hedge funds reveal this cozy culture which illustrates again that there are two types of customers; big ones and retail customers who often dont' receive this information,\" Galvin said in a telephone interview. The complaint cites an email from an unidentified SAC employee who asked a contact at Citi \"can u send me everything u have on the entire iphone 4/4s/5 supply chain?. Citi employees responded immediately by asking their colleagues\" can you please send directly to (employee for SAC Capital)... He needs it asap - works directly for (SAC Capital).' Chang was also contacted directly by a SAC employee. \"Hey Kevin, Are you picking up any order cuts to iPhone?\" the email said. Kevin Chang sent his unpublished research which included the Hon Hai numbers and unpublished research for Apple iPhone order forecasts to the SAC employee on December 13, 2012. Chang's research was published on December 14. A SAC spokesman said he has no comment on the matter. Chang also received emails from Citi colleagues saying that other big clients, including Citadel, wanted his views on Apple. A Citadel employee emailed Chang on December 13 saying \"Can we do a quick call tonight?\" In the securities industry, Galvin, who has been in the job for 18 years, has a reputation as an aggressive regulator happy to take on Wall Street banks in order to protect small, private investors.

On the eve of the party's annual conference in Brighton, the Labour leader said they would look to force an election once it was clear a no-deal Brexit was off the table. However in a round of ITV regional news interviews, he said if there was a hung parliament and they were unable to achieve an overall majority, Labour would seek to govern as a minority government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would not be part of a coalition (Gareth Fuller/PA) \"We would go into government with whatever election result was. I am not doing deals. I am not doing coalitions,\" he told UTV. Mr Corbyn rejected the idea that Labour could offer the SNP a second referendum on Scottish independence in order to win its support at Westminster. At the same time however, he refused to rule out a further public vote later in the parliament if there was a demand for one in Scotland. \"It is not our priority. It is not what I want, it is not what I support,\" he told Border TV. \"But if after some years in government there is a demand, then in terms of the devolution settlement we will look at it at that time.\" Speaking on STV, he added: \"Obviously in the longer run, if a request is made...I am not going to be the one who stands in the way of that.\" His comments came after shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> sparked a furious row over the summer when he suggested a Labour government would not stand in the way of a referendum if there was support for one in the Scottish Parliament. The leader of Scottish Labour, <mark>Richard Leonard</mark>, said at the time the 2014 referendum had been a \"once-in-a-generation vote\" and that the Scottish people did not want to go through a second independence poll. Mr Corbyn said that he would press for a general election once it was clear that Boris Johnson could not force through a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of Parliament. \"When the Prime Minister abides by the law which Parliament has passed which requires him if he cannot get a deal to apply for an extension, I think that is the time,\" he told ITV Anglia. \"What we won't do is to fall into some trap created by Boris Johnson which would lead us into a no-deal Brexit with all the chaos that would bring.\" Mr Corbyn defended his position of seeking to negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and then putting it to the public in a referendum along with the option to remain in the EU, without coming down on either side. He rejected criticism that his policy was a \"muddle\" and that he was failing to offer leadership on an issue of crucial national importance. \"I am not sitting on the fence,\" he told YTV. \"I think leadership comes from listening. I think leadership comes from asking people to look at the realities of the situation.\" It is not a muddled position. It is a position that takes the issue seriously. \"Speaking on Tyne Tees, he added:\" We need a democratic mandate from the people.

And he made a commitment to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court if he is elected president. \u00a9 Matt Rourke/AP Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, accompanied by his wife, Jill, speaks to members of the media at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on March 10. In 1984, the Democratic Party became the first major political party to have a woman as the vice presidential candidate, in Geraldine Ferraro. But no president has ever nominated a black woman to the Supreme Court--a move that Biden hopes will make his candidacy more attractive to black women, one of the most influential demographics on the left. The legality of only considering women for these spots appears to be clear--it's permissible. But some critics have criticized the move as pandering and tokenism. The Democratic field started off with more diversity than any other in history, and some voters on the left expressed great disappointment that the last two candidates standing look like the overwhelming majority of individuals who have occupied the White House: straight, white men. Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today's most popular stories on The Washington Post During the CNN debate this week, Biden said: I commit it that if I'm elected president and have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I'll appoint the first black woman to the courts. It's required that they have representation, now it's long overdue. Secondly, if I'm elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country. And I commit that I'll pick a woman to be vice president. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow, I would pick a woman to be my vice president. A moderator asked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt .) whether he would commit to doing the same. \"In all likelihood, I will,\" he said. \"For me, it's not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have progressive women and there are progressive women out there, so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\" There was plenty of praise for the news. Some, like conservative Washington Post opinion writer <mark>Jennifer Rubin</mark>, praised Biden for taking the lead on the issue. Keneshia Grant, a political science professor at Howard University, told The Fix that she thinks Biden making these commitments is a good thing if his goal is to win the support of more black voters. \"I think the party has to learn from 2016--or I hope it learns--is that you can't take turnout for granted, especially among black people,\" she said. \"When black people turn out, they will likely turn out for Democrats, but you actually have to work on the numbers.\" \"I can imagine it being about women, but I can also imagine it's about excitement, about giving something additional for voters to be excited about,\" Grant added. \"It's one thing to say turnout needs to be high against <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, but I think it will also be helpful to give people something new, historic and hopeful to turn out for--and I think this might do that.\" Others, including women, dismissed the conversation as pandering and pointed to conservative and moderate women in high places of leadership supporting policies that they believe harm other women. Ashley Ray-Harris, a comedian and freelance writer based in Los Angeles, told The Fix that Biden's commitment felt like pandering because it was obvious. \"Two candidates telling me that they're considering women isn't a shock to me,\" she said. \"They absolutely should be.\" \"We know women can do this,\" Ray-Harris added. \"To me, that Sanders was more concerned with policy and who would actually be the right woman or fit would be more of a concern than Joe Biden just saying he'd pick a woman.\" And others addressed the idea as tokenism with some suggesting that the move will subject the woman to accusations of being hired for their gender. Despite the varied responses, promising to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court is not unheard of--or unique to liberals. No less a conservative than Ronald Reagan did similar. While seeking the White House in 1980, Reagan sought to improve his chances with women voters and those who perceived that the GOP was becoming less welcoming to women by promising to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court. \"I am announcing today that one of the first Supreme Court vacancies in my administration will be filled by the most qualified woman I can possibly find,\" he said. \"It is time for a woman to sit among the highest jurists.\" He did follow through on that, nominating Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. Reagan's nomination of O\u2019Connor is a reminder that while controversial, promising to consider only members of one gender for such a powerful position is nothing new. Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School, whose scholarship focuses on the structure of legal and constitutional argument, told The Fix: There's no law, there's not statute that applies to this situation. The only questions would be: Is it unconstitutional for him to do it? And that's a question that's unlikely to reach a court because he has so much discretion in his decision-making that there'd be no person who can show he'd been injured by this act. The same goes for Biden's promise to name a woman as his vice presidential candidate, if he is the Democratic Party nominee. \"The vice president can make whatever promises he wants,\" Greene said. \"He's a private citizen. He doesn't work for the government. He can make any promise he wants without it running afoul of the Constitution, and there is no law that applies to people nominating their VP that I'm aware of.\" Legal experts have said it would not be legal to promise a specific person a job, as it could be considered a bribe. On the topic of tokenism, Greene said there are ways for Biden to add more women's voices to the highest levels of government without accusations of choosing someone solely because of her gender. What one considers to be tokenism is very subjective. I think a lot depends on how you frame this kind of decision. If it's framed as \"I don't care who the candidates are. I'm going to look for a black woman,\" I think that's different framing from \"There's a lot of qualified candidates for the Supreme Court and I think it's important to look at the kinds of people who have not been looked at in the past, so I'm going to focus on African American women knowing there's a range of qualified options\" is a different framing. Biden being direct in promising to nominate a woman is not that surprising to those who have been following the issue. I previously reported on the issue. At this point, perhaps the biggest question for voters on the left is: Who?
