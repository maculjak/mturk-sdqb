Inslee, who backed his state's ballot initiative that would have instituted the nation's first carbon tax, called on the Senate to find a way to intervene, regardless of Senate protocol. He launched a petition drive Wednesday asking Democratic leaders to stop Manchin. \"The fundamental thing I'm saying is the fate of the planet right now has got to <mark>trump</mark> any seniority system of the U.S. Senate,\" he said. Ocasio-Cortez, who hails from Schumer's home state, has introduced her own \"Green New Deal\" plan to transition the country to run solely on renewable energy sources for electricity. Asked about Manchin's possible position on the panel, Ocasio-Cortez on Friday responded, \"I have concerns because I don't think we should be financed by the industries that we are supposed to be legislating and regulating .\" While the Energy Committee doesn't have a direct say on issues like climate change, it plays important roles in areas like federal land and energy policy. The ranking member is expected to try to stop objectionable nominees, attempts to waive environmental laws for logging or oil drilling and perform other tasks. \"The ranking member is a backstop to extreme measures,\" said a former committee aide. \"Some of the concern would be, if no one is pushing back, then it's like there's no minority power .\" Manchin frequently sides with the GOP on the energy panel. He has backed the <mark>Trump</mark> administration, for example, in its ongoing attempts to aid the coal and nuclear power industries, despite nearly unified Democratic opposition. ADVERTISEMENT In a committee vote last month, he supported Bernard McNamee, <mark>Trump</mark>'s nominee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who worked at the Energy Department in support of the coal efforts. But he flipped on Wednesday and voted against limiting debate on McNamee in the full Senate. With Senate committee leadership established by seniority, Manchin could only feasibly be denied the position in two ways: another senior senator vies for the job or Schumer disregards the rules and appoints someone else. But the four Democrats who would be eligible to fill the position aren't interested. The list includes Sen.

But the Finance Committee, where he is currently the top Democrat, is one of the most prestigious in the Senate, and he's given no indication that he would give up the position. Manchin is committed to taking over the job. He told reporters Wednesday that since Senate Democrats have historically handed out ranking memberships based on seniority, he deserves the post. \"I think you all have been around here long enough to understand the system, don't you? Seniority is what it is. So we'll see what happens,\" Manchin said. With other possibilities appearing exhausted, critics of Manchin said the best way to stop him is for Schumer to sidestep Manchin's appointment for a nonsenior candidate. Sen. Martin Heinrich Martin Trevor Heinrich Senate panel advances <mark>Trump</mark>'s energy nominee despite Dem objections Dems wonder if Sherrod Brown could be their <mark>magic man</mark> Heinrich wins reelection to Senate in New Mexico MORE (D-N.M.) would be the next in line. \"The first thing is, Joe Manchin is categorically unacceptable as ranking member and the second thing is that Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer The Hill's 12:30 Report--Latest on Dem leadership votes | <mark>Trump</mark> threatens new auto tariffs | Senators briefed on Khashoggi Schumer welcomes his first grandchild No, it's not a gamble for Dems to back Beto for president MORE can fix this,\" said Lukas Ross, senior policy analyst at Friends of the Earth. \"This is truly a question of moral courage and leadership--it is within his power to waive the seniority rules .\" But doing so would be extremely rare, and could be politically risky--especially considering rumblings that Manchin in the past has considered flipping parties. Senate Democrats take seniority seriously, and could see exceptions as a threat. Schumer's staff would not comment on the record. \"I can't think of instances where it happened. I can think of instances where people agitated for it to happen,\" said a former Democratic leadership aide. \"Everybody just feels like it won't be done,\" said another former staffer. Furthermore, Manchin serves on Schumer's leadership team and the two senators enjoy a close working relationship. \"There's not a snowball's chance in hell that Schumer would push him off for somebody more junior,\" said <mark>Jim Manley</mark>, a Democratic strategist who worked for former Senate Majority Leader <mark>Harry Reid</mark> Harry Mason Reid Water wars won't be won on a battlefield Poll finds most Americans and most women don't want Pelosi as Speaker Schumer walking tightrope with committee assignments MORE (D-Nev .). <mark>Manley</mark> added that Schumer and Manchin have a strong alliance, due largely to Schumer's long-standing refusal to criticize Manchin's more conservative positions. \"I can assure you they have a great relationship,\" he said. That relationship could work to Schumer's advantage. \"If Manchin does ascend to the ranking membership, he has to be attentive to what the Democratic leader's priorities and concerns are, and I would hope that that is actually the case,\" the former aide said. \"Not that there won't be tensions and issues that give the Republicans an opportunity to put the Democrats on the committee in a difficult position, but hopefully with communication and some leadership, they'll figure out how to navigate those situations .\" Tags Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Debbie Stabenow Martin Heinrich Charles Schumer Bernie Sanders Maria Cantwell Chuck Schumer <mark>Donald Trump</mark> Joe Manchin <mark>Bill Nelson</mark> <mark>Harry Reid</mark> Ron Wyden", "articleID": "2018120611_00390505_W", "names": {"Bill Nelson": ["Q22639331", "Q3272899", "Q358437", "Q4910326"], "Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Harry Reid": ["Q19650494", "Q21466700", "Q314459", "Q5671912"], "Jim Manley": ["Q16105372", "Q48976990", "Q6196608"], "Magic Man": ["Q23928996", "Q2654402"], "Michael Flynn": ["Q15712142", "Q25599009", "Q27922514", "Q57046897", "Q6830352", "Q6834757"], "William Nelson": ["Q18601511", "Q54093519", "Q8016066"]}}, {"date": "2018-12-06", "url": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/internet/~3/S2aX37IYXzw/story.asp", "content": "Stock-market bulls are definitely not catching any breaks these days, and Thursday isn't looking like the exception. Thus far, the market isn't sanguine about the chances for further progress on trade relations between the U.S. and China, after the arrest of Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou. Indeed, carnage in global equity markets is already on display. Combine that narrative with an OPEC production gathering that has the market on a knife's edge, and the recipe for more pain seems fairly baked in as traders return from a day off to mourn the 41st U.S. President George H.W. Bush. That detention of a high-profile tech executive in China is being credited, at least in part, for some crazy action for S & P 500 futures as electronic trade restarted in the wee hours of Thursday. As this chart shows, those futures plummeted so viciously at the open that the CME had to step in and stop trading for a period, just to cool things off: FactSet/MarketWatch That leads us to our call of the day from trader Greg McKenna, who runs McKenna Macro. He says while the jury's still out on whether a so-called fat finger, or accidental trade, caused that big spike down, or it was something else, it's a warning shot for investors. \"This is a very dangerous set up. I'm not Chicken Little, but we need to see a base build up or prices will slip,\" he said in emailed comments. \"Market collapses happen from weakness so we need to get through Thursday trade in the U.S. to give folks more confidence again .\" As for retail investors, probably a bit frazzled by now given what the week has thrown at them so far, his advice is to \"stay in the time frame that they trade. Investors invest, and traders trade. Don't get caught outside those parameters .\" McKenna says cash is a \"reasonable alternative\" right now, for those who are a bit unnerved right now. He says the levels to watch are 2,600 for the S & P 500 and above 2.8% for the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. In addition to trade worries, investors have been focused on a narrowing of the yield spread between the 2-year and 10-year government bonds to the tightest gap in about 11 years has many fretting about a potential recession.
