Sheriff Douglas Gillespie, in an afternoon news conference, identified the dead officers as Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31. The two were patrol officers in the area. \"What precipitated this event, we do not know,\" a subdued Gillespie said. \"My officers were simply having lunch when the shooting started .\" He did not identify the dead assailants or the victim shot in the Wal-Mart. A woman who said she witnessed the start of the bloodshed described an execution-style assault on two officers who were eating pizza and probably never saw the attack coming. Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill said the two suspects ambushed and shot the two officers shortly before 11:30 a.m. at the CiCi's Pizza at 309 N. Nellis Blvd., near Stewart Avenue. Officer Larry Hadfield, a Metro spokesman, said one of the suspects yelled, \"This is a revolution .\" Gillespie, however, said at the news conference he could not confirm the revolution comment. One of the officers was able to fire back during the ambush, Gillespie said. The assailants then took the officers' ammunition and reportedly ran inside the Wal-Mart on Nellis Boulevard between Charleston Boulevard and Stewart Avenue. A number of responding officers followed the suspects into the store, McMahill said. There, the assailants shot and killed at least one person inside the front door of the store. They exchanged gunfire with police inside the store before the female suspect shot the male suspect and then killed herself in an apparent suicide pact, according to Gillespie. McMahill described the assailants' lives ending an an \"apparent suicide pact .\" Sheree Burns, 48, said she left church early, lured by the all-you-can-eat pizza for $5.55 at CiCi's. She said she was seated just behind the two officers, who already were eating. A man came up to one of the officers - a balding man - and shot him in the head, Burns said. Instinctively, Burns ducked under her table but peeked up to see who she thought was a woman shoot the other officer in the head. Burns said she saw the male assailant - whom she described as tall with scruff on his face - hovering over the balding officer and remove his handgun from his holster. The two assailants then left CiCi's, en route to the Wal-Mart, Burns learned after talking to police. \"I'll never leave church early again,\" Burns said. McMahill said there were \"literally a thousand\" witnesses to the midday events at the busy shopping center. \"It is a very complex, very dynamic crime scene,\" he said. Inside the Wal-Mart, Mayra Calvillo, 19, was working near the front of the store when she heard someone yell, \"Get out of Wal-Mart!\" Calvillo said she turned around and saw a man with a handgun raised in the air. The man, whom Calvillo described as white and dressed in a navy blue shirt, jean shorts and a hat, fired at least one round. Calvillo described the unfolding scene as surreal. She said she started to run, then realized she needed to help direct the store's customers safely out of the store. Others described a pandemonium-filled scene. Jesus Bustamante, 26, said he was in the electronics section of the store when he heard a muzzled sound and people screaming, \"It's a shooting! It's a shooting!\" Bustamante said he wasn't sure whether to run out or take cover in the store, but he saw a Metro officer run past him saying, \"Get the (expletive) out of here!\" Bustamante said those trying to get out of the store was typical for a busy Wal-Mart: elderly, children, parents. A mother at the scene who asked not to be identified said she was in a dressing room with her 7-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son, who were looking for outfits for a relative's graduation. The mother said she heard two gunshots followed by pandemonium breaking out inside the store. Her first thought; How do we get out alive? She said she immediately grabbed her children and sprinted out a backdoor near the changing room. Once outside the store, she said she saw police officers swarming near the CiCi's and hear bystanders screaming that two officers had been shot. Alex Estrada, who was at an IHOP nearby, said he saw a crowd of about 30 to 40 people run out the back door of Wal-Mart around 11:30, and people on the streets and at nearby businesses were talking about the incident. Still dazed from the midday events, Burns stood outside Applebee's a few blocks away awaiting a ride home. When her friend arrived, Burns wept into her arms. \"I saw it all,\" Burns said. Residents of the area had mixed feelings about where they lived. A few employees at a nearby restaurant said it didn't surprise them. A schoolteacher who has lived here 13 years said, \"It can happen anywhere .\" Calvillo, who has worked for 11 months at the Wal-Mart, expressed similar sentiments. \"I'm still in shock. I feel like it hasn't hit me yet. I'm scared. I don't feel safe anymore,\" she said. Nell Jones and her daughter, JaNell, have lived here for two years. They are getting out in August. Almost nightly, Nell said, Metro helicopters, \"ghetto birds,\" pass overhead presumably on a suspect's tail. \"It's all these gang-bangers,\" Nell said angrily. Metro has doubled up its officers on patrol while officers gather more information about the shooting. Officers also are wearing badges shrouded with black ribbons in honor of their deceased colleagues. The media wasn't initially allowed into the entrance of University Medical Center Trauma, where some victims of the shooting had been rushed in. Metro put police tape around the entrance, just north of Charleston Boulevard, and large Command Center utility vehicle from the North Las Vegas Police Department was parked nearby, its telescopic antenna jutting into the air. The police tape came down around 5:30 p.m. Capt. <mark>William Scott</mark>, who oversees Bolden Area Command, which is just north of U.S. 95 and abuts the command area where the shootings took place, said tough times would be coming as officers ponder the senseless act. \"We'll talk a lot about this,\" he said of himself and his officers. \"We will always have each other's backs .\" NBA Finals in Vegas: Heat vs. Spurs Game 2 betting preview, odds and picks"}, {"articleID": "2019062915_00118819_W", "names": {"Andy Murray": ["Q10125", "Q526811"], "John Mcenroe": ["Q16474", "Q37772659"], "Peter Fleming": ["Q21463755", "Q729789"]}, "date": "2019-06-29", "url": "http://tewkesburyadmag.co.uk/sport/national/17738907.murray-calls-for-doubles-shake-up-at-wimbledon/", "content": "<mark>Murray</mark> calls for doubles shake-up at Wimbledon By Press Association 2019 <mark>Andy Murray</mark> warming up to compete in the doubles at Wimbledon 0 comment <mark>Andy Murray</mark> would like to see matches at Wimbledon shortened to encourage more singles players to play doubles.

It is especially hard at Wimbledon, with the doubles tournament, uniquely among the slams, also being played over best of five sets. <mark>Murray</mark> said: \"Beforehand you had a lot more of the top singles players that were playing the doubles. Like when (<mark>John</mark>) <mark>McEnroe</mark> was playing, around that time .\" A lot of the top doubles teams, they were pretty well known, like the Woodies (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) and stuff.

For me, even though I'm playing doubles here, it's even a consideration if I'm going to play mixed, as well. I would never expect a top singles player to enter the doubles here because playing potentially 10 sets in one day is just too much. \"That's something that maybe would be worth looking at, to give more value to the doubles event, to get more of the top singles players playing, is to reduce the length of the matches a bit .\" It will be a different Wimbledon experience for <mark>Murray</mark> this year, with the former world number one having to wait until Wednesday at the earliest to get his campaign under way. <mark>Andy Murray</mark> insists he has not been watching very much tennis during his rehabilitation (Steven Paston/PA) And <mark>Murray</mark>, known as an obsessive follower of tennis, revealed he has mostly stayed away from the sport while he has been working his way back from surgery. \"I haven't really hardly watched any tennis in the last 12 months\" he said. \"Since the operation I had in January, I literally didn't watch anything hardly at all .\" When you're around the event, there's matches on the TV. I wouldn't sit from the first point of a match and watch a best-of-five-set match because it can be four hours of the day. I'm here to do stuff. I want to be with my family and things.

The Scot said:\" I think that's probably one of the things that I will try to make sure doesn't change over the next few years. I think a lot of that stuff kind of comes out from other people.

by concentrating on the boring, yet highly profitable units that most tech bloggers yawn at. microsoft business division (responsible for office 365, which is about to become a billion-dollar business) and server and tools (with multiple billion-dollar businesses under its umbrella) are both bigger than windows. meanwhile, the windows division reported flat revenues even though pc shipments dropped by 14 percent during the same period. i've read several critiques from armchair financial analysts implying that ballmer and co. are somehow cheating by including its new surface hardware line in the windows division's results. but that's microsoft's strategy for windows, part of its initiative to become a \"devices and services\" company. you can argue about the execution of that strategy, and you can place bets on whether it will succeed. but there's nothing timid or tentative about it. and then there's apple. superficially, its business looks as diversified as microsoft's, with revenue and profits coming from a variety of products. but in the same quarter where microsoft's profits were up 19 percent, apple's were down almost 18 percent. there's no question that apple will sell lots more iphones and ipads. but as ceo <mark>tim cook</mark> acknowledged on the earnings call, \"we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012 .\" in developed markets, apple has masterfully executed against its plan to sell high-priced, high-margin products to the wealthier segments of the buying public. but there's evidence that that market is saturated, and the first-mover advantage is gone. on the same earnings call, <mark>cook</mark> conceded as much: \"we can't control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures .\" growth for apple in its existing product lines means appealing to more price-conscious buyers and moving into markets where the $618 average selling price of an iphone isn't an option. is there another breakthrough hardware product in apple's back pocket? it's hard to believe that a smart watch or a tv has the potential to define a category as the iphone and ipad did. maybe services? revenue on the itunes/software/services line in apple's just-completed quarter was up 30 percent. but as the latest 10-q report makes clear, that's a by-product of the larger installed base of ios devices: this increase was due primarily to growth of itunes [which] reflects continued growth in the installed base of ios devices and expanded itunes digital content and applications offerings around the world, resulting in higher net sales on the app store and higher net sales of digital content. outside of itunes, apple hasn't exactly excelled at delivering services to its own customer base, let alone expanding those services to a larger market. so it's hard to see that as a real growth opportunity. indeed, that's the real difference between steve ballmer's microsoft and <mark>tim cook</mark>'s apple. ballmer has a significant challenge in one division that represents about a quarter of his company's revenue, while other divisions are growing steadily outside the gaze of the gadget-obsessed tech press. meanwhile, apple has become downright boring and predictable. as felix salmon today's earnings report marks the point at which apple is officially no longer a high-growth tech stock, valued on its monster potential. instead, it has become a cash cow, valued on its ability to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into its shareholders' pockets. that's actually a fairly accurate description of microsoft's performance in the ballmer era. and given the challenges of the economy and a fickle technology market, it's a significant accomplishment for both men. ed bott ed bott is an award-winning technology writer with more than two decades' experience writing for mainstream media outlets and online publications. imagine a document and it is shipped off instantly...first i never saw george do that, second what the hell are you talking about? google \"microsoft cooler than apple\" looks like to most, other than you, microsoft is seen as cooler today than in many moons. that being said, some typewriters were pretty neat. you know, it's typical here for people to equate proprietary with features. actually, by not using active-x, alternatives just as applications, contrary to ms office which is deeply entrenched into the os, similar to internet explorer. confusing proprietary to essential feature is born from microsofts' monopolistic tendencies, nothing more. how ironic and ridiculous to make an apples-to-oranges comparison type analogy by referring to the price of cows and goats. the author was not, for example, comparing the price of an iphone to the price of a microsoft surface pro. he specifically was looking at common measures of both companies? revenue growth or decline rates, stock price rise or decline rates, etc. how ironic also for this commentator to be talking about others' state of denial when in fact he is ignoring the actual growth in microsoft revenues in absolute and relative terms. i suggest refresher courses, e.g. comparisons 101, irony 101, reality 101, etc.; -) way up overall. way up on office 365. way up on cloud services. way up on server systems. windows flat. wp8 only slightly up. the point is that microsoft redesigned itself years ago to be ready for a shift away from windows. they will do fine. and maybe they will even get some traction. who knows?? remember windows live? countless of cloud-based services too many to count with little popularity, they've bundles all * of those into windows 8 because they weren't making a name for themselves as services and microsoft's products were fractured, they're all in windows 8 now (including zune which they call xbox music & xbox video now), even bing is big in windows 8, if there's anything to microsoft, it's that they preserve everything, no matter how much they've failed, microsoft keeps supporting them. * = many windows live services have feen merged, example: windows live mesh, windows live skydrive and several \"minor -\" services have been merged into microsoft skydrive. if windows 8 is an indication of anything, it's that microsoft believes in windows, and thinks \"windows 8 is the way to the cloud\". if i understand you correctly you practically hate microsoft for allowing integrated search, skydrive, cloud sync et al. actually it is a great way to connect windows to the cloud which people will be using more and more every day. windows live was no failure (hotmail, live mail, skydrive, msn messenger, office web apps), they were used more than comparable services. having all of those present without any additional downloads is brilliant. something i've wanted since xp. @ stevenababy see? this guy here is the most common kind of prime example of really stupid writing, talking like he has a point, actually says nothing substantive, but makes a claim, a claim by the way provably and obviously wrong, but says it as if he means it and as if its based on some common truth. its obvious and uncontestable crap. his claim: \"face it ed, the world is beginning to realize that it can live without windows and office\" the world is beginning to realize no such thing. what a joke. neither the particular business i am in or any of the businesses i have been through nor any of the homes or anyplace ive been to over the years seems to have had any so called \"realization' that windows isnt needed. what a load of guff. its like someone took a pile of nonsense and distilled it down to its finest form. what the world may have realized is that you don't need windows to run a cell phone or tablet. this in itself is a joke. its like saying\" the united states is beginning to realize that you don't need russian built rockets to go into outer space \". ummm? i don't get it? are you claiming they just recently came to realize this? like? didn' t the u.s.a. go to the moon or something already without russian rockets? like, a bunch of years back? and similarly, when did the world ever think that windows was needed for a cell phone or a tablet??? my guess would be something like the 12th of never. it seems to me that the whole world in so far as business and home use of windows goes that years ago they would walk into best buy and look at desktop computers and laptop computers, there been an area for macs for some time. if they were not buying a mac they were buying a windows computer. sometimes, although we know rarely, people will now sometimes buy a chromebook. we know that people don't buy nearly as many desktops and laptops as in the past because everyone already has one. and we know, just exactly like the\" good old days \"about 90% of the computers sold are still windows computers. it dosnt fly in any sense of the term that the world is coming to realize that they don't need windows. its just impossible given the facts that the world actually knows exists. hopers and dreamers that want windows and usually ms to disappear and die use such phrases based on the fact non windows os tablets and cell phones have sold amazingly well, but it has shown absolutely nothing to the notion the world can get by without windows. nothing, as like in not a thing. its like saying that now we have airplanes and submarines the world is coming to realize we don't need automobiles. we know why people say these really stupid things. it allows them to dream of a world in the near future where things are more like the way they would like them to be. it gives some fertile ground for them to hope and dream there is some rational belief for thinking that their dream world is somehow closer to a reality than it actually is. the world still needs windows every bit as much as they always have. at least certainly in general. and worse yet for the ridiculous dreamers who for odd reasons hate windows and ms so much they live to exist in this dream world, is that we are not really much closer in significant ways to being any closer to any kind of world that can get by without windows yet. cayble, a very well written and thought out piece. my only thoughts are: for pretty much every windows hater, there are an equal amount of apple haters, which is very evident on this site, whom also want to see the demise of apple. what many of these haters don't seem to understand, is that we really don't need or should want any company to go down, the resulting effects it has on everyone is bad. people will be out of a job in an economy that is already strained enough, and then the other businesses that deal with those products also loose business and customers. and then of course, the consumers loose in the end as well. i prefer to have choice, just as i prefer to use different platforms for different parts of my job, or at home. but if it's one thing i've learned over my life, a lot of people just like to complain, and they need something or someone to take it out on. and they never seem happy unless their bashing something, trying to make themselves feel better than others...but it's none of the people you mentioned. where in mr. bott's article did you find any reference to goats? the only reference to cow, as in cash cow, was in a quote from another article. mr. bott did not promote microsoft. all he did was take readily available data, and do a side-by-side comparison. he even said that the stock market was known to be way off. his point was that the evidence does not support the assumptions - for either ms or apple. microsoft hit with competition complaint over windows 8 uefi secure boot zdnet newsletters get the best of zdnet delivered straight to your inbox we're temporarily in maintenance mode, which means you won't be able to sign up for a newsletter. please check back shortly to resume the subscription process. thanks for your patience. white papers, webcasts, & resources explore the features and functionality of oracle real application clusters 11g release 2 oracle exalogic elastic cloud deploys and upgrades applications quickly, handles massive transaction volumes, maintains a consistent set of technological standards, and connects seamlessly. learn more in this"}, {"articleID": "2016121515_01209085_W", "names": {"Mark Hughes": ["Q1494363", "Q214513", "Q21516094", "Q3294110", "Q33676880", "Q39073279", "Q58235929", "Q6768131", "Q6768132", "Q6768133", "Q6768134", "Q6768135", "Q6768136", "Q6768137"]}, "date": "2016-12-15", "url": "http://duncanbanner.com/oklahoma/news/firefighter-applicants-undergo-testing-this-week/article_baebef25-4add-5ddd-aaea-24f301a7a0df.html", "content": "1of 2Staff photo by <mark>Mark Hughes</mark> Basic firefighter applicants leave a smoke-filled building as part of their testing to become a member of Muskogee's Fire Department.

The test's purpose is to find out if applicants are afraid of heights. The candidate is wearing a safety belt with lines attached. ENID, Okla.--Zack Gamble said that since he was a child he's known he wanted to be a firefighter. \"Firefighters have always been my hero,\" the Broken Arrow man said. Honor, community service and employment were some of the reasons given by applicants taking Muskogee Fire Department's employment tests this week. \"There were 86 applications submitted, and about 49 of them showed up to compete for four entry level firefighter positions,\" said Jeff Watkins, training officer, about Tuesday's agility test. The first test was to run or walk 1 1/2 miles in 13 minutes, and 21 made it through the run and three could not complete 35 sit-ups in two minutes. They were also required to finish 25 pushups in two minutes. Austin Seabolt of Muskogee had a leg up on his competitors. While in the U.S. Navy, he was required to run 1 1/2 miles in 13 minutes and 30 seconds. By coincidence, he was trained to work in the Navy police and fire departments. He was pretty confident of passing the agility test because he works out at the gym about five days a week, he said. Teddy Baker of Fort Gibson is one of the applicants. \"It has always been my nature to help others. That is my calling, and this is a godsend,\" Baker said. Levi Drier of Vian said finding employment near home is difficult. \"There's not many good jobs to choose from,\" Drier said. Muskogee resident Jake Woodard said the agility test wasn't easy. \"The run was most difficult with the cold wind,\" Woodard said. During their run, and remaining portion of their test, the temperature was 44 degrees with wind chill making it feel like 37 degrees, said a National Weather Service meteorologist. \"We typically lose 50 percent on the run, but some years 40 percent and other years 60 percent,\" Watkins said. The candidates also will take a written test and be interviewed by the chief officers. Once the four candidates are selected a drug test and physical evaluation is conducted. Watkins said that the selectees are on probation for a year and will receive a monthly evaluation that includes their performance, attitude and respectfulness. They also have to pass an emergency medical responders course and a basic firefighters course. The remaining agility events determined whether applicants had back problems, were claustrophobic or afraid of heights.

Well, 2 seconds too early. The woman, who is called Sarah in the video, received the ticket for parking in a \"no parking zone\" that ended at 10 a.m.. The ticket was issued at 9:59 and 58 seconds. Judge <mark>Frank Caprio</mark>, who has his own YouTube show \"Caught in Providence\" turned his disbelief over the ticket into humor. \"You've taken the wrong path in life,\" he told the woman with a smile. The woman said her car clock said 10 a.m., and the judge teased her for blaming the clock. <mark>Caprio</mark> also joked that Providence's parking enforcement officers \"were second to none in the country\" before dismissing the violation. \"I think 9:59 is close enough to 10,\" <mark>Caprio</mark> said.

For this episode I hit the track at Le Mans to find out what it takes to push a car and a driver to the limit during that celebrated 24-hour race as director James Mangold talks about his new film \"Ford v Ferrari,\" and then I discuss the recent Los Angeles Times list of the \"20 Best Asian American Films of the Past 20 Years\" with San Diego Asian Film Festival artistic director Brian Hu, who initiated the list with film critic Justin Chang as the festival prepared to celebrate two decades of showcasing Asian and Asian American films.

The senior middle hitter has chosen to play at Ohio State in the fall of 2015. Yerington verbally committed to play for the Buckeyes last week and couldn't be more excited. \"It's been one of my dreams since I was probably in seventh or eighth grade to go to Ohio State and play a sport there. At first I wanted to play football because I was playing football at the time and then I switched to volleyball my freshman year so that was kind of my dream to get there and play there,\" Yerington said. Yerington explains how the recruiting process all came together. \"Coach Hanson actually sent me an email and asked for my phone number so he could call me and talk about it. I didn't really have words at the time I was kind of just exuberant almost,\" Yerington explained. With a skilled player like Yerington, it's hard not to talk about his success at Hamburg. Head Coach <mark>Brian Carroll</mark> explains how he's been able to be so successful. \"Zach's a big part of our team but it's not all about him. He's definitely a person who can put a ball away when we need that but we also have some very high skill players in other positions that allow him to have the success he has. He's talked about how he's going to be going to Ohio State, he needed to have a team get him there to have the skill to be able to get looked at. He has a lot of kids here who have helped him along the way so in a way really our whole program is going there which is kind of nice,\" Coach <mark>Carroll</mark> explained. Even though Yerington already has his college career lined up, he still has one more season left with Hamburg and expectations are high as usual. \"I think we're going to be good I think we can push for the sectional championships again and hopefully further but we've got a tough road ahead of us because there's a lot of tough teams in our division,\" Yerington pointed out. \"Our team is solid, pretty well rounded, we're pretty deep and have a team of eleven but a majority of the kids will be able to get on the floor during the season. We have a lot of experienced players returning as well as some nice youth coming up to fill the roster out,\" Coach <mark>Carroll</mark> pointed out. The Bulldogs look to win back-to-back sectional titles this year and Coach <mark>Carroll</mark> seems confident in his group's work ethic this season."}, {"articleID": "2018042719_00062723_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Kim Jong-Un": ["Q10855883", "Q56226"], "Barbara Bush": ["Q153730", "Q190628", "Q2884044"]}, "date": "2018-04-27", "url": "http://wdel.com/blogs/allan-loudell/open-friday-weekend-forum-special-korea-edition/article_f08360d6-4a34-11e8-9138-8769dc2ad455.html", "content": "So which stories / issues / topics grab your attention here at the end of the week? At week's end, Delaware's media, political, and academic establishments were still rocked by that homicide-suicide in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania. So many folks knew Meredith Chapman. And, as we've learned, homicide-suicides perpetrated by women are quite rare. Looks like Delaware's three casinos could be on track to get a tax break to keep them viable. At least, the state Senate finance committee has okayed a measure to reduce taxes and fees; it remains to be seen if this package will clear the legislature. I realize jobs are on the line, but casinos are no panacea for jobs, as even some very impoverished places--such as Tunica County, Mississippi--have discovered. Casinos are no elixir. In fact, with all kinds of gambling, we have an oversaturation of casinos. Just look at Atlantic City. So would Delaware lawmakers be throwing good money after bad? And let's not forget the ugly social costs from all this gambling. From casinos to state lotteries, a charlatan's way to raise revenue. That task force that reviewed the pros and cons of consolidating school districts in Delaware decides consolidation is not the way to go. No matter the calls to talk-shows and letters to the editor of newspapers. The benefits of consolidation are also illusory. It's interesting how many of the proponents of consolidation also somehow favor charter schools, which require principals, assistant principals, and, of course, buildings. Can't people comprehend the inherent contradiction? Not to mention making a school board and superintendent even more remote from the general community? I happen to come from a part of the country (suburban Chicago), where each village or town generally has its own school board and administrators for the elementary schools (K-8). But the high schools come under the township level, with their separate school boards and administrators. Could you imagine? Yet, because the public schools enjoy widespread public support in most cases--with hardly any competition from Catholic or other private schools--you don't hear all that consolidation talk. Even with much higher property taxes. Consolidation is also not some elixir. During the \"Susan Monday Show\" this (Friday) morning, I heard Susan and callers debate whether President <mark>Trump</mark> should get most of the credit for the two Koreas seemingly come together. Not so fast. From my analysis, such talk is unrealistically premature. What good is a vague North Korean pledge to denuclearize? People have short memories. We've seen this before. Arguably, North Korea's dictator <mark>Kim Jong-Un</mark> is just trying to detach South Korea from its U.S. alliance. Arguably, Pyongyang has set a trap for President <mark>Trump</mark>. Has \"Rocket Man\" not pulled out the rug from underneath President <mark>Trump</mark>? Because if President <mark>Trump</mark>, in a summit, cannot win intense verifiable inspections of North Korea's nukes - and he withdraws from any talks, or even again threatens North Korea--Mr. <mark>Trump</mark> comes off looking like the global bully. From The Guardian...And a reality check from The Asia Times...Yet, clearly, in South Korea, at least some people are optimistic, given all the hopeful visual symbolism. But again, this could serve to detach South Korea's interests from America's. From The Korea Times of Seoul...Yet, there's something to the argument that President <mark>Trump</mark>'s \"Crazy-like-a-Fox\" posture brought North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong-Un</mark> to the negotiating table. From Australia's Melbourne Age...Still, one can't help but think: Either this unorthodox President has achieved a great breakthrough precisely because he's avoided all the usual diplomatic niceties, or he's fallen into the same trap as all his predecessors, but doesn't even realize it yet. From The Atlantic...Of course, the buzz has begun: <mark>Donald Trump</mark> for the Nobel Peace Prize! From New York Magazine...I continue to believe the <mark>Trump</mark> Administration is toxic for nearly all who serve in it. Almost everyone who serves comes out diminished or degraded. This analysis from Politico Magazine...Also, from Politico Magazine: \"The Puzzle of Sarah Huckabee Sanders\" Article continues below advertisement Remember so-called \"Freedom Fries\" (in response to France's opposition to the proposed second invasion of Iraq, in 2003)? That seems so long ago, when many Americans were enraged with France. Now, France has arguably eclipsed Britain and Germany as a top international player with the U.S., following French President Macron's state visit to Washington. The Germans certainly are aware. From Spiegel...What is so ironic is that the French President's speech to Congress was, in so many ways, a sharp rebuke to Trumpism.
