Subscribe to our daily newsletter Sign UpSarah Tysoe with her son George Tysoe, right, and aviation historian Jonny McNee The family of a British war pilot have visited the spot where a Spitfire aircraft crash-landed in a field in Ireland. Second World War pilot Lieutenant Gordon Hayter Proctor bailed out of the plane moments before it plummeted into the field in Co Monaghan. The Spitfire crashed because of massive engine failure during a flight across Northern Ireland on September 20 1942. The pilot's niece Sarah Tysoe travelled from England on Thursday after local archaeologists uncovered parts of the Spitfire last year which remained buried in the field since WWII. The aircraft's engine are among some of the parts exhibited at Monaghan County Museum. This summer, Monaghan County Museum hosts a fascinating new exhibition: The Monaghan Spitfire--Life on the Border with a World at War.

Mr <mark>Bradley</mark> said: \"The Spitfire suffered massive engine failure and the pilot bailed out. Advertising\" As the engine is so front heavy it flew on for a few minutes but once it lost power it dipped down almost at an 80-degree angle at 400 miles an hour. \"Most of the plane disintegrated on impact but the engine was buried some three metres below the surface. The pilot parachuted out and landed a few miles across the border in Co Tyrone. Mr McNee said:\" The Spitfire crash is part of the local history. Advertising \"Everybody heard about it, lots of people went to the area and stole a bit of the plane before the Irish Army arrived. Sarah Tysoe views the crank shaft of the Spitfire plane (Brian Lawless/PA)\" Proctor was flying with a meteorological flight that were based at RAF Aldergrove (Belfast). He would go up and take the temperature, humidity and air pressure. \"He did that two or three times a day and feed information back to the base .\" The first thing he did when he landed was bury his parachute as he didn't know if he was in the North or South. \"The locals approached him, politely, with pitchforks. But they welcomed him and he had a bath and a meal and was able to ring his base .\" Some hours later he was back flying. He was an exceptional pilot. \"However, the pilot went missing in Burma in October 1944 and was never found. Ms Tysoe described the visit as\" surreal \".\" It's amazing to actually see the spot, it's indescribable, \"she said. Sarah Tysoe is shown the site were the plane came down by Josie McCusker, who witnessed the crash first-hand as a schoolgirl (Brian Lawless/PA)\" I've only known about this since February as when I watched Dunkirk I decided to search his name.

However, the night wasn't all fun and games for the movie star, because Selena Gomez's comments about <mark>Trump</mark>'s family separation policy proves that she hasn't forgotten about today's political issues. You go, Selena. During the movie premiere, Gomez revealed that <mark>Trump</mark>'s family separation policy has \"affected\" many people around her. \"It's extremely disheartening,\" Gomez said. \"There's a lot of confusion and anger. It's definitely been affecting so many people who are close to me .\" The recent crisis of separating immigrant children from their families at the border has resulted in the public organizing protests to fight against the <mark>Trump</mark> administration's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy. Since these protests broke out, a number of celebrities, Gomez included, have spoken in favor of the fight to end this separation. On June 29, Gomez tweeted in support of the Keep Families Together Marches that took place on June 30. She wrote, Families seeking safety in our country need protection, understanding and opportunity, not detention. This is a moral choice, not a political one. I don't know about y' all, but there's seriously nothing I love more than celebrities speaking out on the issues. Following the complete backlash in response to <mark>Trump</mark>'s family separation policy, <mark>Donald Trump</mark> signed an executive order on June 20 that would stop this crisis. However, there's still a number of problems that need to be addressed even with the new order. On June 29, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that they plan to detain families together and hold them in detention centers indefinitely, or up until their immigration cases. To protest <mark>Trump</mark>'s family policy, individuals all over the nation gathered together on June 30 in honor of the Families Belong Together march. The Families Belong Together (FBT) Coalition, one of the key nonprofits who spearheaded this march, discussed on their website how this crisis is still not over even with the executive order signing. The coalition said, We're rallying in Washington, D.C., and around the country to tell <mark>Donald Trump</mark> and his administration to permanently end the separation of kids from their parents. End family internment camps. End the \"zero-humanity\" policy that created this crisis. And reunify the children with their parents. From Washington D.C. to Los Angeles, CA, people from all over the nation marched together to fight against <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s separation policy. Even though this activism is coming from unfortunate circumstances, it's still so inspiring to see the passion these concerned individuals have for the injustices immigrant families are currently facing. Joe Raedle/Getty Images News/Getty Images Despite <mark>Trump</mark>'s claim that the executive order will \"keep families together,\" NBC News reported on June 27 that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is reportedly asking for more military space to house detainees. According to NBC News, DHS asked the the Department of Defense (DOD) for space that would care for a \"family population of up to 12,000 people .\" Also, nearly 2,000 of those families would require housing within 45 days. Elite Daily reached out to DHS for comment at the time, but did not hear back. Clearly this border crisis isn't going anywhere, but rest assured that activists and other concerned individuals will be fighting against the <mark>Trump</mark> administration in any way they can. Not everyone can take part in weekend marches to protest witnessed injustices, but that won't stop people from calling out <mark>Trump</mark> staffers wherever they can. On June 22, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was eating at Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, VA, but was asked by the owner, Stephanie Wilkinson, to leave the establishment. In fact, Sanders is just one of a few White House staffers that has been openly heckled while eating out in public, such as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and <mark>Trump</mark> senior adviser <mark>Stephen Miller</mark>. I might not have been able to see this public outcry go down, but this is kind of what I imagine it to resemble.

Jacklyn Davis, a spokeswoman for Anne Arundel County police, said the letters were received Monday. They were mailed to an attorney for The Capital newspaper, a retired judge of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals and a Baltimore judge. The letter Ramos sent to the Annapolis newspaper's Baltimore-based lawyer was written to resemble a legal motion for reconsideration of his unsuccessful 2012 defamation lawsuit against the paper, a columnist and then-publisher Tom Marquardt. Marquardt shared a copy of the letter with The Associated Press. \"If this is how the Maryland Judiciary operates, the law now means nothing,\" Ramos wrote. He quoted a description of the purpose of a defamation suit, saying it was intended for a defamed person to \"resort to the courts for relief instead of wreaking his own vengeance .\" \"\"That' is how your judiciary operates, you were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,\" Ramos wrote. He signed it under the chilling statement: \"I told you so .\" Below that, he wrote that he was going to the newspaper's office \"with the objective of killing every person present .\" In a letter attached to what appeared to be the faux court filing, he also directly addressed retired special appeals court Judge Charles Moylan, who decided against Ramos in his defamation case. Ramos sued the paper after pleading guilty to harassing a high school classmate. \"Welcome, Mr. Moylan, to your unexpected legacy: YOU should have died,\" he wrote. He signed it: \"Friends forever, Jarrod W. Ramos .\" Douglas Colbert, a University of Maryland law professor, described the letters as \"very powerful\" evidence of intent that the state will make full use of at trial. Colbert said as long as it's established in court that Ramos authored the letters, they will be used to show his \"planning and deliberate actions\" on the day of the attack. The apparent admissions by the defendant will weaken a defense lawyer's strategy of suggesting that he was \"suffering from a mental disease or defect\" that would impair his ability to understand the consequences of his actions, Colbert said. Ramos, 38, has a well-documented history of harassing the paper's journalists. The defamation suit was thrown out as groundless, and he often railed against current and former Capital staff in profanity-laced tweets. Police found him hiding under a desk after Thursday's attack and jailed him on five counts of first-degree murder. At a memorial service Monday night for one of those killed, editor Rob Hiassen, Marquardt said he once slept with a baseball bat by his bed because he was so worried about Ramos. He also said that they \"stepped up security\" at the newspaper years ago, and posted Ramos's photo around the office. \"But then he went dormant for about two years and we thought the problem has been solved. Apparently, it was just building up steam,\" he said. The mourning in Annapolis continued Tuesday, marked by a lowering of U.S. flags to honor the victims. President Donald Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff on federal property through sunset. Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley said Monday that Trump, who has repeatedly called journalists the \"enemy of the people,\" said he had been told his request to lower the flags had been denied. The White House said Tuesday that Trump ordered the flags lowered as soon as he learned of the mayor's request. Buckley expressed frustration Monday afternoon when he was told by a Maryland congressman's office the request had not been granted. He said he considered lowering flags on his own, but decided to follow protocol. He said he received a call from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders just after 11 p.m. Monday, asking him for confirmation if he personally was making the request. \"She was very sympathetic,\" Buckley said in an interview. \"She felt for our community. She said\" I'll get back to you in the morning,' and she called me 7:16 this morning to say the president had issued a proclamation, and we're very grateful for that. \"Hiaasen was remembered Monday evening in stories, poems, prayers and songs at the\" celebration of life \"ceremony Monday evening.

It comes amid fears from anti-EU MPs that the Government position will be watered down - although chief whip Julian Smith reportedly told them they would not be forced to vote for a deal they do not like. Tory minister defies <mark>Theresa May</mark> to say a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for business ANALYSIS: Brexiteers fear a stitch-up as <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s \"third way' customs plan takes shape Tories at war as Brexiteers hit out at <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s customs compromise plan Mrs <mark>May</mark> will present her Cabinet with her new customs plan at a crunch showdown at Chequers tomorrow. According to reports, the proposals are a mix of the two previous suggestions - both of which were rejected by Cabinet sub-committees tasked with investigating them. The so-called facilitated customs arrangement will use tech to keep the Irish border open but will still leave the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of Europe, it has been claimed. Downing Street is said to be confident the new plan - designed to free the UK to strike its own trade deals while still exchanging goods with the EU - offers the\" best of both worlds \"and has business support. But Mr <mark>Davis</mark> told Mrs <mark>May</mark> in his letter that Brussels would not countenance a plan that would allow the UK to police the EU border, according to the Daily Telegraph. A source told the paper:\" This plan would be like <mark>Donald Trump</mark> allowing us to keep an eye on his borders for him, it will never happen. \"We need to have this row in the party now so that we have time to negotiate something bespoke with heads of state before it's too late\". The source added: \"It provides unfair advantage to British companies .\" Meanwhile, the Sun reports that Mr <mark>Davis</mark> fears the customs plan would be too great a softening of the Government's Brexit red lines and wants to harden the Prime Minister's stance. \"It's a choice about strategy. Do you be extremely reasonable and adjust, or do you face down the EU?\" a pro-Brexit figure told the paper. \"They will come to us eventually, we just need to hold our nerve .\" FACILITATED CUSTOMS PLAN The facilitated customs arrangement would see the UK collecting the correct level of tariff at the border regardless of whether goods are bound for the UK or the EU - a marked difference from the previous plan. Technology would allow the Government to determine in advance where 96% of the goods are headed - while tariffs on the remaining 4% of goods will have to be rejigged later, as per the old plan. A Number 10 source told the Times: \"This is a serious proposal that addresses the legitimate concerns of the EU as well as the new for the UK to be able to sign free trade deals .\" It takes the best bits of both models and ensures a friction-free border in Northern Ireland while at the same time allowing businesses to benefit. \"\"REALLY FOOLISH' But eurosceptic MPs have already raised concerns about the plan - in particular suggestions it could involve keeping the UK in a single market on goods. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group of Conservative backbenchers, told the BBC such a plan would be\" really foolish \". But according to the Times, chief whip Julian Smith told Mr Rees-Mogg and his allies in a meeting yesterday:\" If you don't like it, you don't have to vote for it. \"Mrs <mark>May</mark> will travel to Berlin today to discuss the new customs proposal with chancellor Angela Merkel.", "articleID": "2018070506_00069098_W", "names": {"David Davis": ["Q1174175", "Q1174177", "Q13471238", "Q16206936", "Q28037658", "Q300023", "Q41256031", "Q4710588", "Q56596944", "Q843907"]}}]
