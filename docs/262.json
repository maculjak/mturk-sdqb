In an interview with the Nine Network broadcast on Tuesday evening, <mark>Gillard</mark> did not resile from the June 2010 leadership coup \"even with the benefit of hindsight\" - even though most senior Labor figures now do, regarding the strike against Rudd as a fundamental mistake. In characteristically unflinching fashion, <mark>Gillard</mark> told interviewer <mark>Ray Martin</mark>: \"Still, even with the benefit of hindsight, [I] don't see an alternative to what I did that day .\" <mark>Gillard</mark> also declared she would have \"out-campaigned <mark>Abbott</mark>\" if the Rudd forces had not destabilised her and run her down before the 2013 federal poll. \"If I'd had a clear run...I would have out-campaigned <mark>Abbott</mark>. I would have run a better campaign and I could have landed us in the same spot. That's my view, others will contest it, I get that .\" The conversation with <mark>Martin</mark> broadcast on Tuesday night is part of a promotional drive for <mark>Gillard</mark>'s memoir, My Story, to be released on Wednesday. <mark>Martin</mark> noted during the interview the memoir is a tale of \"almost unbridled treachery\" - a reference to her poisonous relationship with Kevin Rudd, which is canvassed extensively in the book. Despite being unable to countenance a viable alternative to deposing Rudd, <mark>Gillard</mark> is not without regret about the events of 2010. She regrets that she \"fed hope\" to Rudd in their fraught conversation over whether there were any circumstances in which he could hold on to the Labor leadership after their confrontation in June. She acknowledges that the act of blasting Rudd out of the prime ministership was traumatic for him and consequential for her. It assigned her a reputation for \"political brutality\" - \"the woman who wielded the knife\" - a difficult bequest given that in the critical moment of decision, she'd actually been \"hesitant .\" She told <mark>Martin</mark> the voters were surprised and disconcerted by the abrupt leadership change because she and other Labor players had shielded them from the government's policy drift and descent into internal paralysis. <mark>Gillard</mark> suggests she thought Rudd would move on and more than likely quit politics, \"free from the weight...because he'd found it so difficult in those last few months. Obviously I was wrong about that .\" \"If you look at my prime ministership there was this sort of cocktail, the internal destabilisation, the minority government - I think a harshness in the public critique - all of that swirled together to make it very hard political yards,\" she said. <mark>Gillard</mark> said her prime ministership felt like a fight on two fronts. \"You had this parallel tracks between what the opposition was saying about me and what the, you know, internal critics were saying about me - and that was a very hurtful, powerful dynamic .\" <mark>Gillard</mark> says she promised Rudd the foreign affairs portfolio after the loss of the leadership in a transaction designed to \"stop the leaks .\" Tuesday night's interview with <mark>Martin</mark> covered a range of topics. <mark>Gillard</mark> accepts complete responsibility for the \"real <mark>Julia</mark>\" botch up in the 2010 campaign. The newly minted Labor leader used a newspaper interview to attempt to reset a campaign plagued by leaks and missteps and excessive stage management by insisting she would, henceforth, be \"the real <mark>Julia</mark>\" - a declaration which served to reinforce voter's doubts about her authenticity. \"I put my hand up for that, one hundred percent...a dumb rookie error .\" <mark>Gillard</mark> is highly critical of press gallery journalists. She says some \"became activists in the leadership contest...(and) that's not their job as journalists .\" She also used the conversation with <mark>Martin</mark> to deliver a hard flick at radio talkback host <mark>Alan Jones</mark> - the broadcaster who declared <mark>Gillard</mark>'s father had \"died of shame .\" <mark>Gillard</mark> says <mark>Jones</mark> delivered only a \"mealy mouthed apology\" for the infelicitous outburst, and he only delivered that because of commercial pressure. \"It was a disgraceful thing; unforgiveable .\" She says she felt \"sorry\" for Germaine Greer - who made a famous crack about <mark>Gillard</mark>'s \"big arse\". From \"being the feminist for our times, to end up talking like that for cheap laughs about another woman was a really sad thing\". There are reflections on her time in the Lodge, the famous misogyny speech, her relationship with partner Tim and their daily routine, her atheism, her personal rapport with US president Barack Obama, the pressures of appearance and fashion for female leaders - and reflections on <mark>Tony Abbott</mark>. She says <mark>Abbott</mark> lacked the application required to persuade the cross bench independents to form a minority government after the 2010 election. \"I turned up, I was there every day doing it personally. <mark>Tony</mark> took a different approach .\" She contends that in the prime ministership, <mark>Abbott</mark> is a \"slave\" to the whims of <mark>Clive Palmer</mark>. \"On the big questions where the major parties have divided Mr <mark>Abbott</mark> can't do anything unless <mark>Clive Palmer</mark> says yes .\" On gay marriage - an issue she worked against in government, <mark>Gillard</mark> accepts \"we are going to see same sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world .\" The Great 2014 Celebrity Nude Photos Leak is only the beginning US confirms 14 air strikes against Isis in Syria US air strikes against Isis and Khorasan in Syria - live updates Carbon map - which countries are responsible for climate change? \"Fuck it, I quit': Alaska TV reporter makes on-air exit to fight for pot legalisation Man avoids being hit by car and survives being knocked off bike by truck Charlo Greene tells viewers she owns Alaska Cannabis Club Israel shoots dead two Palestinians suspected of killing abducted teenagers Deepika Padukone: Bollywood star in titillation row with Times of India US air strikes against Isis and Khorasan in Syria - live updates US air strikes against Isis and Khorasan in Syria - live updates <mark>Julia Gillard</mark>: I don't see an alternative to what I did that day Australians preparing to fight overseas could face life imprisonment", "articleID": "2014092310_00013784_W", "names": {"Clive Palmer": ["Q5134643", "Q550879"], "Julia Gillard": ["Q41563", "Q59400153"], "Ray Martin": ["Q7297787", "Q7297788", "Q7297789", "Q7297790", "Q7297791"], "Tony Abbott": ["Q348577", "Q7821736", "Q7821738", "Q7821739"]}}, {"date": "2014-09-23", "url": "http://marinij.com/dining_food/ci_26591323/from-editors-kitchen-can-you-really-have-fine", "content": "From the Editor's Kitchen: Can you really have a fine dining experience at a mall? I admit it - I am a food snob. I hate eating in restaurants that are in malls. Maybe it's because I lived in Florida for a few years, where just about every fine dining establishment is in a mall. So I was a bit shocked that I actually enjoyed dining at the Mariposa Restaurant in Neiman Marcus a few months ago - not just in a mall but in a department store in a mall! Of course, it was in the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu and on a lanai overlooking the beach and the Pacific Ocean with the gentle trade winds caressing me, the intoxicating smell of plumeria trees wafting by and a mai tai in my hand. But in general, the idea of making a mall a destination to dine feels all wrong. Casual? Sure. Fine dining? Uh, no. We're lucky that Marin has a lot of upscale restaurants that aren't in malls. But, we have a handful that are. What about you? Do you enjoy the mall dining experience? What about restaurants in department stores? Let's dish! Send in your comments in 200 words or less in an email to lifestyles @ marinij.com by Oct. 17; please put \"Editor's Kitchen\" in the subject line. Don't forget to include your full name and hometown. We'll run them in the Oct. 29 Plus section and online. Last month we asked readers how they feel about dogs in restaurants in light of Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark>'s recent signing into law a bill that permits dogs besides service dogs at restaurants with outdoor areas throughout the state. I was surprised by how many don't like it, especially since we are such a dog-loving county. Here's what they had to say: Most Bay Area dog owners will always insist that their dog is harmless and is not a nuisance to anyone else, and they will refuse to acknowledge any evidence to the contrary. But any dog CAN in fact be harmful and be a nuisance, for a long list of reasons; that is why it has always been well-understood that we need strict rules on dogs in shared public spaces. These rules are for the health and safety of everyone in our community. Dogs are not people, and do not have the rights of people. Dogs should always be on a leash in public places; they should not be brought into public buildings; and they should not be brought anywhere near where food is sold. Dogs are unclean, and some people can have serious allergic reactions to dogs, so it is dumbfounding to me that we would revise our laws to allow them in restaurants. I see no tangible benefit from this, but plenty of potential drawbacks. Dogs in public places, along with inconsiderate and self-entitled dog owners, are a serious and growing nuisance in the Bay Area. AB 1965 is just another step in the wrong direction. - Jim Feldman, San Rafael It's cruel I'm one of \"those\" people who don't have a problem with animal testing. Rats? Dime a dozen. Would I stand by and let anyone mistreat a defenseless animal? Never. Speaking of animal cruelty, isn't it cruel to subject your beloved pet to all the trauma of being around BIG humans? Isn't it cruelty to stuff them into your little shoulder bag? Or stuff them into a \"made for puppy\" stroller? Isn't it down right cruel to make them go shopping, or be at a food establishment when they can't even order an entr\u00e9e? I've been subjected to \"pets\" in so many environments, like the grocery store; I actually have a picture I took on my cellphone where little Fido is sitting in the child area of the cart, with no layer between the pups bum and the cart. I've seen dogs, regularly, at the farmers market. When I mentioned this to a woman she said, \"Well, they should have signs .\" Really? They do, and do you really need to be told? The real animal cruelty is depriving your pet the unbridled joy of greeting you when you get home. Or, \"how can I miss you if you don't go away?\" - Abby Danielson, Novato Enriching life Our dog, Dutch, loves to go out to restaurants with us. He's a very well-behaved Tibetan terrier (almost 4 years old), and enhances our eating experience, particularly since he eagerly manages to share our meal. He doesn't bark, doesn't cry, doesn't create a ruckus - simply sits tight until the food arrives and then waits patiently for his handout. His presence also enhances the social experience since most people in Marin love dogs and will readily come over and chat with us while giving Dutch lots of attention. Who could possibly have a problem with that? A dog not only enriches the dining experience, but also enriches all aspects of our lives. Kudos to <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> for recognizing that. - Terry Bremer, San Rafael Better than some kids I think it is a great idea and one whose time was too long in getting here. We have always had one or two dogs and love taking them with us to dine out. Most of the time they are much better behaved than the children that are in the same place - they certainly never throw their food, scream and throw tantrums or do any of the other bad behaviors often witnessed by us. I would love to see dogs allowed inside restaurants - as they are in some of the best European ones - but at least this is a start. Pets, as well as children, need to be under the control of their \"parents\" at all times and this makes dining out with them a pleasure. - Sandy Hufford, San Rafael Disturbing trend Thanks for asking us to weigh in on the \"Take your dog just about everywhere\" trend. It takes a dog lover to speak up for those of us who are dismayed by the surge of canine encounters in public places. It's politically incorrect to say you'd rather not shop or eat a meal with someone's best furry friend down by your ankles. The fact is that even the sweetest, most docile doggy companion can be unpredictable. I wonder if the older woman who's small dog suddenly leapt up and bit me on the thigh because my \"hat frightened her\" ever thinks about me. I think about that encounter. She went off saying, \"She never does that .\" Well, obviously she does! And that's the point. In a store, restaurant, museum or farmers market unexpected things can happen. In the past year I've encountered dogs in all of those places. This despite large signs posted at the entryway and legitimate rules in place concerning hygiene. Most dogs are fine and sweet but overly friendly dogs can be almost as much a problem as aggressive ones when they greet you (uninvited) by jumping, or snuffling you and planting a nice smear on your shin or skirt. It mystifies me why someone would bring their dog to certain places. I'd be a little anxious that he/she might do something to disturb others and that would impact my own experience. But I think that many dog owners don't understand that their pooch is special to them but not to everyone and it's rude to give them freedoms that impinge on others. Even a dog/babe-in-arms might be vocal or smelly. I've noticed that many service people and business owners are cautious about causing a scene and so I'm glad that the IJ is giving us a forum to say: \"Please leave your best buddy at home when you go shopping or out to eat .\" By the way, I'm not talking about casual places with outdoor spaces where you would expect to see folks out for a walk with their pet. And if a business owner is a dog lover and encourages their presence I will do my part by choosing a different establishment but I hope that the doggy takeover in Marin allows dog-free places to remain; know that there are customers out there who appreciate it! - C. Powell, Corte Madera \"Gone to the dogs' California has literally\" gone to the dogs. \"So now bus boys will not only have to clean the tops of the tables; but they will also have to clean up dog urine and feces from underneath the tables. The restaurant menus for pit bulls and mastiffs dining outside will be: Chihuahua or toy poodles for an appetizer and perhaps a small toddler for an entree. Are dog owners insane? Is our Assembly a bunch of idiots? Has no one considered the potential danger and folly of allowing innumerable dogs together in the same place around each other and food? What were you smoking, Governor\" Moonbeam \"when you signed this inconceivable bill into law? - Pamela Lunstead, Novato Not my darling Please, leave Fido home or with a sitter while dining in a restaurant. Not everyone thinks your dog is a\" darling. \"It's bad enough that they are allowed in malls, at street fairs and in outdoor restaurant areas to be tripped on and cleaned up after, to say nothing of the confrontations that often occur between two canines. Sanitation is certainly another issue. I, for one, would not dine in a restaurant, upscale or otherwise, if dogs were allowed inside. - <mark>James Carroll</mark>, San Anselmo Leave them home I have a dog and love dogs but really - why are people dragging their dogs everywhere? Do people really think their dog enjoys shopping at the mall, going into the fitting rooms, being dragged from store to store? I am so tired of encountering dogs en masse everywhere I go. Barking, ill-mannered dogs are no better than screaming children. When we go out to eat I really do not want to sit next to dogs. I have that at home and certainly do not want it at a restaurant. Nowadays everyone seems to have some sort of companion dog. Are there that many people in the world that need this security or is it just an excuse to take their dog wherever they want? I know one thing for sure - my dog would much rather be sleeping comfortably at home than having anxiety with all the commotion at malls, restaurants, etc.. People, leave your dogs at home! - R. Boyett, Ignacio Not a fan Dog are wonderful beings and have enhanced man's life throughout time. However, I am baffled by this growing presence everywhere. I've seen dogs in carts at grocery stores, large long-haired dogs brushing through racks of clothing at malls and yes, at outdoor eateries. I recognize the beauty and companionship they provide, but am opposed to this ubiquity. First, is this where your dog wants to be? Being stepped around on a dirty sidewalk or at the mall? As for dog allergies, they are real and life threatening. Additionally, people don't have control. Dogs bark and nip. And seriously, Marin, why can't you pick up your dog's droppings? Municipalities increasingly spend more and more money dealing with this issue. And now it's near restaurants and at the mall. Dog waste is not organic fertilizer. I love dogs, but I'm not a fan of this new development. - Nicole Kowalski, San Rafael Form of abuse Regarding dogs at restaurants, with some exceptions of course, I can't see a good reason for people to bring one. To force the poor thing to patiently lay down and hungrily smell delicious food and not be able to have any while they enjoy theirs is a form of abuse and just plain cruel as I see it. It shows total indifference and lack of any real concern for the dog. To display this treatment makes me both sad and angry. It spoils the entire meal for me. Naturally, I'll go out of my way to avoid restaurants that allow dogs. - Lorraine Peters, San Rafael No yapping, please If the outdoor dining space at a restaurant is large enough to accommodate dogs I think it is OK to bring dogs along providing they are clean, well-behaved and not yappy. Some people are totally oblivious to the idea that not everyone is in love with their dog. And the claim that the dog is a service dog is often abused and an untrue claim to that effect can have negative consequences for those people who truly need a service dog. - Nancy Valente, Mill Valley She causes smiles Our dog is part of our lives. We take her with us whenever we can and for lunches we seek out places with outdoor seating so we can bring her with us. All of the places here in central Marin, with outdoor dining, welcome us, including our pooch. She is better behaved than some of the patrons and certainly quieter. She normally just goes to sleep under our table and gives us comfort by her presence. Most all time people come over to pet her and say hello and it seems to me that she enhances their luncheons as well as ours. She generates a lot of smiles. We've never encountered a negative reaction. So if you see us with our 60 lb beautiful golden doodle we hope you get a smile out of it. - Robert Greber, Greenbrae A delight to see Dogs are allowed in fine restaurants all over France, including Paris. In a country where a reverence for food and dining etiquette are unquestioned, this is a non-issue. Is it that French humans and dogs are more well-behaved? I currently do not own a dog, but am delighted to see well-trained dogs and well-trained humans wherever I go. - Nancy Heinemann, San Rafael Not her best friend I do not like dogs and they do not like me.
