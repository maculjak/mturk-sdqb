many have taken the ecb to task for being slow to cut interest rates. the fed, meanwhile, appears to be all out of bullets--and markets know it. in 2008, the u.s. central bank cut rates sharply to zero and recently pledged to hold them there until at least 2013. it has also poured $2.3 trillion into the financial system through asset purchases, a policy that helped boost stock prices but did little for an economy where growth has slowed to a crawl and the jobless rate remains stuck above 9 percent. but the fed's latest move on wednesday--targeting lower long-term interest rates by selling treasuries with short maturities to buy longer-dated ones--was met with a sharp stock market selloff and widespread doubts about its ability to boost growth .\" it was a terrible omen, because the stock market had rallied like clockwork after previous fed policy moves as if it were christmas day, \"said michael cheah, who helps oversee $1.5 billion at sunamerica asset management .\" this was the first time the market reacted very badly. it shows they are out of magic dust. \"<mark>bill gross</mark>, manager of pimco, the world's largest bond fund, told reuters in august,\" it is increasingly apparent to us that policy options are limited and that economic growth is slowing down. \"with consumers not willing to spend and businesses wary of hiring, some investors have called for the government to step up spending to keep the economy afloat .\" without it, at best, we muddle along. at worst, we double dip, \"doug kass, who runs hedge fund seabreeze partners in palm beach, florida, wrote in a note to clients. policy paralysis but with the united states already running one of the largest budget deficits as a share of output since world war two, political opposition to such spending is high. president barack obama proposed a $447 billion job package this month but is facing stiff resistance from republicans, who object to tax hikes on the rich to pay for it. in the past 24 hours, markets even had the specter of a government shutdown to contend with after the house of representatives defeated a <mark>bill</mark> wednesday that would fund federal operations past september 30. republicans said the issue will be sorted out, but the flap conjured bad memories of a summer battle over the debt ceiling that ended with the united states losing its top aaa credit rating. what's more, a bipartisan group of u.s. senators is pushing a <mark>bill</mark> that would crack down on china for keeping its currency undervalued against the dollar. economists fear that may spark a trade war, another threat to a healthy world economy and another echo of the 1930s. room for optimism there could be a silver lining to all the turmoil, though .\" policymakers--be they in the u.s. congress or europe--often need a crisis to act, \"said jack ablin, chief investment officer at harris private bank, with $55 billion under management .\" maybe watching the stock market plunge in the last 24 hours will light a fire under them. \"for the bold, the latest market swoon may be a golden opportunity to buy on the cheap. david kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at cumberland advisors, said guaranteed s & p 500 index yields as a percentage of stock prices still look set to outpace yields on government bonds, calling it\" an extraordinarily high reward for anyone willing to invest in stocks. \"but cheah said investors should play it safe for now .\" when driving into a thunderstorm, you slow down and, if possible, stop the car. this is not the time to say the stock market is cheap, i want to buy or the bond market's overvalued, i'm going to short it, \"he said .\" if you go to cash, you live to fight another day. \"slideshow u.s. walks out of iran's u.n. speech policy schmolicy! policy like we've been seeing can do nothing when the basic problem is that 2-3% of the people in the nation own 95% of the wealth. we need to get over the stupidity that this does not matter. all the money we need to drive growth and hiring is being held captive by a small group of elites who don't give a flaming #$% $about the rest of the country. we are being grievously damaged by a small group of american elites who have plundered the nation. our problem centers on the greed that has been allowed to drive all the wealth into the hands of only a few. new york (reuters) - stocks plunged on thursday, extending a selloff to four days, as policymakers' failure to arrest global economic stagnation sent markets spiraling downward. more?
