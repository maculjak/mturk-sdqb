Steve Scalise, R-La. wrote that the recent turbulence over Obamacare is a result of the fact that \"Republican leaders are struggling mightily to come up with [government funding] legislation that can pass the House .\" If either of these statements were true, it would be huge news that House Republicans are veering further right, and giving hardliners in the party a vote on a bill that actually ties funding for the government to defunding the health care law. But they're both false. Here are the odds that Scalise and his colleagues will defund or delay Obamacare. Costa's so in the thick of the GOP's internal debate he elided the obvious point that \"passing the House\" doesn't equal winning 218 Republican votes. Plenty of reasonable stuff can pass the House above and beyond a simple bill extending funding for the government, once it gets a vote. Put those irreducible facts together, and it's easier to remember that what we're hearing on the right is the din of 275 Republicans and thousands of movement conservatives caterwauling at each other. It's a fascinating story. It's genuinely newsworthy that John Boehner and company were cowed into giving Ted Cruz and his boosters on the right a vote on the doomed strategy they've been demanding. Assuming the defund Obamacare bill passes the House - not a given! - it'll be extremely revealing to watch Senate Republicans figure out what to do with it, and hear what they say when it inevitably fails. But at the end of the day, it's really just a subplot in the ongoing saga of the GOP's devolution since 2006 or so. It's an internal bluff calling, intended to both placate conservative House members, and prove to others that their strategies aren't workable. Once that happens, then Congress can get on with the entirely separate and much simpler business of funding the government. Boehner's already copped to this! If he's able to placate enough Republicans along the way, they might even walk away with a substantial win. In a way this is actually good news. The debt limit will likely be increased through a similar process of internal deleveraging. But when the news broke, a lot of news outlets treated it like an escalation. The odds of a shutdown just increased, according to the political media. The only reason to believe that, though, is that all this whipsawing takes time. Is it possible there just aren't enough days on the calendar for Congress to pass a spending bill before the government shuts down? Perhaps. I continue to think it's unlikely. Twelve days is an eternity on Capitol Hill when leaders get down to brass tacks. Even if I'm wrong, though, and there's a brief lapse in funding for the government, it'll be an error of timing, not of broader legislative strategy. GOP leaders are still working toward a much different set of objectives than their conservative antagonists, or than Newt Gingrich was in 1995. National Review might have forgotten about the 200-plus Democrats in the House, but John Boehner has not. Industry puppets spew obscene lies while people drown Finally!

Hughes is among the state legislators who have raised concerns with new ethics rules they see as too restrictive. Becky Bohrer AP Photo JUNEAU, Alaska Alaska state Sen. Shelley Hughes withdrew a health care bill she's been working on for more than two years and declined meetings on health care policy to avoid running afoul of new ethics rules she and other lawmakers see as too restrictive. The ethics law passed last year details circumstances under which a lawmaker would have a conflict and limits what action the lawmaker can take if he or she has one. Under the legislative ethics committee's interpretation of the law, legislators can participate in committee and floor debate and vote on bills where they have conflicts, as long as they declare those conflicts. But they can't have similar discussions in private with fellow lawmakers or anyone else. The bill's sponsor said that goes far beyond his original intent, and he and others are looking at possible changes. Sign Up and Save SUBSCRIBE WITH GOOGLE #ReadLocal The law bars legislators from taking or withholding official action or exerting official influence that could substantially hurt or help the financial interests of an immediate family member; the employer of a lawmaker or their immediate family; someone with whom a lawmaker is seeking employment; or someone from whom the lawmaker or an immediate family member has made more than $10,000 over the prior 12 months. The definition used by the Select Committee on Legislative Ethics for \"official action\" is broad, including development, sponsorship, advocacy of or opposition to a law, amendment, resolution or other matter affected by legislative action or inaction. Hughes said the law prevents her from discussing health care policy with her husband, a physician assistant. In a speech to colleagues, Hughes said she withdrew her bill aimed at lowering health care costs because her husband and the clinic where he works could be financially harmed by it, and that was seen as a conflict. Ethics laws should keep lawmakers from manipulating the system for their own gain, Hughes said. \"But when the law prevents us from drawing from our own experience...and from the knowledge that we gain from living with the people we love, it needs to be fixed,\" the Palmer Republican said. \"When the law prevents us from working in the best interests of the people we serve...to address the problems they face, the law needs to be fixed .\" Lawmakers with conflicts can have general discussions in private that avoid specifics of pending legislation or that aren't used to develop legislation related to their conflict, legislative ethics committee administrator <mark>Jerry Anderson</mark> said. But, some lawmakers worry, if the seed for an eventual bill is sown during a general conversation, could that be a violation? That's a realistic concern, <mark>Anderson</mark> said. Senate Majority Leader Mia Costello said legislators are erring on the side of caution and in some cases declining meetings. The state does not have a full-time Legislature. Some lawmakers have other jobs, including attorneys, fishermen and a doctor. Some also have working spouses. Costello is an Anchorage Republican who flies, is married to a commercial pilot and represents a district that holds Alaska's largest commercial airport. In a floor speech, she said she intended to introduce a bill that would have given the Legislature approval of certain aviation-related fees, but didn't because of the new law. \"Everything we do, we're wondering, can I do that? Can I talk to this person?\" Costello said in an interview, adding later: \"We don't want to overreact, either. I don't think we are doing anything but trying to figure out right now what this actually means .\" Former Rep. Jason Grenn, who sponsored the ethics law, said he intended for it to force legislators to be more public about potential conflicts in committees and on the House or Senate floor--and didn't intend to delve into private meetings. \"When it comes to private discussions, you have to have some level of trust with our elected officials,\" Grenn said. The ethics committee's interpretation acts to \"kind of kick common sense out the door,\" the Anchorage independent said. He lost his re-election bid in November but said he's spoken with current legislators about possible revisions. Grenn said the aim was public transparency, not trying to address any potential corruption that other laws or rules already address. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Begich, who serves on the ethics committee, cautioned against \"over-interpreting\" the new law and said legislators with questions can check with <mark>Anderson</mark>'s office. Begich is open to changes that clarify the law but not a wholesale rewrite. The Legislature needs to find the right language \"to ensure that we protect the right of the public to have legislators with integrity on one hand and on the other hand protect the right of the public to have access to the expertise of the people they elect,\" he said. \"That, believe me, is a fine line, and we must find it .\" "}, {"articleID": "2019020910_00266474_W", "names": {"Bruce Hill": ["Q14951084", "Q4209690", "Q4977656"]}, "date": "2019-02-08", "url": "http://www.presstelegram.com/2019/02/08/1-7-tons-of-meth-bound-for-australia-seized-from-ports-of-l-a-and-long-beach-in-record-setting-operation-authorities-say/?fbclid=iwar10zg8pydrl5s8iluig4v1e7vasul8kbtcu8epdlqo3qurxfunp7mlkp-4", "content": "By Megan Barnes | mbarnes @ scng.com | Long Beach Press-Telegram PUBLISHED: February 8, 2019 at 3:21 pm | UPDATED: February 8, 2019 at 4:16 pm This photo provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows an officer extracting methamphetamine from a loudspeaker on Jan. 11, 2019 at the Los Angeles-Long Beach seaport.

(Photo courtesy Australian Federal Police) Show Caption of Expand Six people were arrested this week in connection with the planned shipment of nearly two tons of drugs bound for Australia that was intercepted at the twin ports complex of Los Angeles and Long Beach--in the largest-ever domestic seizure of methamphetamine, authorities said. The 3,810 pounds of meth was hidden with 56 pounds of cocaine and nearly 12 pounds of heroin in a shipment of loudspeakers seized in mid-January, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The joint operation by U.S. and Australian authorities began when Australian agents found out about a massive planned shipment of narcotics and alerted Homeland Security Investigations, officials said. The drugs were concealed in dozens of metal boxes in two containers marked \"Single Loud Speakers\" that were targeted for inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. They had yet to be loaded onto a ship. Australian Federal Police estimated the meth had a street value of $1.29 billion, or 17 million \"hits .\" Two Americans--a 52-year-old man and a 46-year-old woman--and four Australians allegedly involved in a drug-smuggling operation behind the shipment were apprehended in Victoria and New South Wales, Australian officials said. Authorities found more meth and \"hundreds of thousands of dollars of proceeds of crime,\" during a raid in Woodstock, a suburb of Melbourne where the Americans were arrested, they said. Three of the suspects were set to appear in court in Melbourne on Friday. If convicted of the drug charges, they each face up to life in prison. All are being prosecuted by the Australian court system. Officials heralded the effort as a major blow to the transnational crime syndicate. \"Along with our law-enforcement partners here and around the world, we continue in a day-to-day battle against the blight of methamphetamine that continues to devastate our communities,\" Joseph Macias, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles, said in a statement. \"We are keeping this dangerous contraband from reaching our streets and potentially saving lives .\" <mark>Bruce Hill</mark>, assistant commissioner with the Australian Federal Police, said \"by stopping this, we have ensured criminals will not profit from the immense pain these drugs would have caused our community .\" Get the latest news delivered daily!

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Technology Editor Read bio October 16, 2018 A satellite on the far side of the moon might not be quite what the Chinese say, Air Force official warns. China's lunar probes may one day threaten critical U.S. satellites, said one of the military's top experts on space threats. \"We've seen [reports] in open press...that say the Chinese have a relay satellite flying around...the flipside of the moon. That's very telling to us,\" Jeff Gossel, the senior intelligence engineer in the Space and Missile Analysis Group at the Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center, said at an Air Force Association event on Friday. In May, China launched the Chang' e 4 lunar relay satellite on an unusual trajectory: a lunar swing-by that pulled the satellite in a wide arc before settling it into a \"parking orbit\" at Lagrangian 2 on the moon's far side. The Chinese government has said the mission is part of a four-stage plan to build a moon base. \"We hope to start the construction of the [robot-manned] lunar base around 2025 and realize a manned landing on the moon around 2030,\" Zhao Xiaojin of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group told Xinhuanet in March. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. But Gossel said putting a satellite at L2 could also enable Chinese attack spacecraft to zoom past the moon--about a quarter-million miles away--and then sneak up on critical U.S. intelligence and communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit, just 28,300 miles up--as occurred in the 2011 apocalypse-themed film \"Melancholia .\" A dipiction of a lunar swing-by trajectory, courtesy of NASA \"You could fly some sort of a weapon around the moon and it comes back--it could literally come at [objects] in GEO...and we would never know because there is nothing watching in that direction,\" he said. \"Why do you need a relay satellite flying around L2? So you can communicate with something that's going to land on the other side of the moon--or so you can fly around the other side of the moon? And what would that mean for our assets at GEO?\" <mark>Michael Griffin</mark>, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, has been pushing for a more robust response to threats against U.S. assets in space. It's one reason he and others want to move away from big, easily targetable satellites in GEO toward large constellations of small, cheap ones in low-earth orbit. \"China and Russia now have the capability to go after\" intelligence and communications satellites in GEO, <mark>Griffin</mark> told reporters in August. \"Those assets are what we use for communication and reconnaissance and missile warning and position, timing and navigation, a whole bunch of features that we use for war fighting .\" Gossel said that the actual threat from lunar satellites like the Chang' e 4 is very small--but that it's his job to be a bit \"paranoid\" and seriously think about even highly unlikely threat scenarios. Brian Weeden, who directs program planning at the Secure World Foundation, argued that the possibility was too low to constitute a significant threat. \"I think speculating about military applications for China's lunar program is akin to Soviet concerns about the Space Shuttle being a potential weapon,\" Weeden said. \"There is a grain of truth behind the Shuttle being a space weapon and the Chinese lunar program having possible military applications. Doesn't mean either is reality, though .\" Still, Gossel said, the national-security community's interest in China's lunar activities is \"building steam .\" Stephen Kitay, deputy assistant defense secretary for space policy, as well as the office of the Director of National Intelligence have \"an interest in it,\" he said. \"That's where I come into play .\" Paulina Glass contributed to this post.

Nyia Parler left her 21-year-old son - who is quadriplegic and has cerebral palsy - lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair and Bible while she left town, police said. He was found Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he was left there between the time he and his mother were seen together on Easter Sunday and before his mother boarded a bus Monday for Maryland to visit her boyfriend, said Lt. Walker said the victim was found was around the corner from their home and described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place this way:\" She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away. \"During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was\" completely defenseless \"in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said .\" It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing, \"he said. Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said .\" Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful, \"he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and\" was in shock when he learned what happened, \"Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now the care of other family relatives, Walker said. Parler, 41, of Philadelphia, will face charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police. Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Maryland authorities said Parler was admitted to a hospital Sunday morning for treatment of an undisclosed condition .\" When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition, \"Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police told the newspaper. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving .\" He seemed to be a little happier yesterday, \"Walker said .\" You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. \"Dear Abby: Friendly divorce may be best for unhappy wife Emotional memorial for pedestrian killed in S.F. car chase Actor <mark>Ryan Reynolds</mark> hit, not injured, by car in Vancouver Consumer Reports survey identifies cheapest, most expensive...4-year-old's tip leads to discovery of her parent's bodies Activate!

Photo / <mark>Mark Mitchell</mark> <mark>Chris Boyd</mark> is not so sure that the chances of four New Zealand sides reaching the semifinals are as cut and dried as many pundits and the form book would suggest. \"The sides are close enough together for travel to be a factor, but it's not going to be the factor. I think sides can win this competition home and away,\" says the Hurricanes coach, reflecting on his charges' top billing heading into the Super Rugby playoffs. \"The Stormers are an unknown because no New Zealand side has played them this year. It's very hard to get a handle on just how strong the Stormers are, but they'll be hard to beat at Newlands. A very well rested Lions side will be tough to beat in Jo\" burg. The Brumbies are capable on their own patch as well. \"<mark>Boyd</mark> noted how tough the Crusaders' travel schedule is, given they did not depart for the Republic until today .\" I wouldn't like to say there are going to be four Kiwi sides [in the semis]. I hope there are. \"While he acknowledged the Sharks will have a long travel haul to come to the capital and face a side riding high and smarting from the 32-15 reverse they suffered in Durban in May, that will not alter the Hurricanes' mindset or preparation this week .\" That performance is a long time ago now and we've got some reasonable momentum at the moment, so we just have to make sure we get our preparation right and tick the boxes. We've found with this side that our preparation is crucial to our performance, so we need to make sure it's nice and tidy this week, and enjoy the fact that we can come out and play a quarter at home, where we probably didn't think that would happen, even though that was always the goal, \"says <mark>Boyd</mark>. One shift in mindset is that the Hurricanes no longer have to go all-out in search of a bonus point. They can play percentage rugby if that is required. Beauden Barrett did, however, kick the ball 12 times against the Crusaders, so expect something similar on Saturday night, especially if things get gnarly in the packs. And expect Barrett to have more penalty shots at goal than he had against the Crusaders, where he had none. <mark>Boyd</mark> may have selection puzzles in his front-row if Reggie Goodes does not fully recover from a head knock. He will need to train fully by Thursday, leaving the\" Tongan Bear \"Loni Uhila to make another big impact off the bench. Midfielders Vince Aso and Matt Proctor are likely to be available, though it would be a tough call on Willis Halaholo if he was demoted. <mark>Boyd</mark> can reflect on a solid 11-4 regular season:\" We've dropped four games, two of them by a point, to the Highlanders and Chiefs, and had two blowouts, in round one [against the Brumbies] and then against the Sharks, \"he says. It looks like he has the making of a champion team, and one that was ranked seventh on the table before the dramatic victory last weekend .\" On paper, it's possibly not even the best side in the playoffs, but it's a good team. \"- NZ Herald Read more by Campbell Burnes Email Campbell Burnes Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day's news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW 00 days 00 hours 00 minutes--V. view match---- Loading Olympics 18 Since NZ sent its first official team in 1920, the country has twice failed to secure a medal: At London in 1948 and Moscow in 1980.

Of all the kids in the school, it was Mrs. Krabappel and Bart that had this loving relationship. I think Bart gave her a little more joy than grading papers.
