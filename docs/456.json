Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email North Korea has threatened to scrap a historic summit next month between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark> over military exercises between Seoul and Washington. The surprise declaration, which came in a pre-dawn dispatch in North Korea's state media, appears to cool what had been an unusual flurry of outreach from a country that last year conducted a provocative series of weapons tests that had many fearing the region was on the edge of war. It is still unclear, however, whether the North intends to scuttle all diplomacy or merely wants to gain leverage ahead of the planned June 12 talks between Mr <mark>Kim</mark> and Mr Trump. Meanwhile, Pyongyang cancelled a high-level meeting with South Korea. The two Koreas were due to meet at a border village to discuss how to implement their leaders' recent agreements to reduce military tensions along their heavily fortified border and improve their overall ties. The North's Korean Central News Agency called the two-week Max Thunder drills, which began on Monday and reportedly include about 100 aircraft, an \"intended military provocation\" and an \"apparent challenge\" to an April summit between Mr <mark>Kim</mark> and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, when the leaders met on their border in their countries' third-ever summit talks since their 1948 division. \"The United States must carefully contemplate the fate of the planned North Korea-US summit amid the provocative military ruckus that it is causing with South Korean authorities,\" the North said on Wednesday. \"We'll keenly monitor how the United States and South Korean authorities will react .\" Annual military drills between Washington and Seoul have long been a major source of contention between the Koreas, and analysts have wondered whether their continuation would hurt the detente that, since an outreach by Mr <mark>Kim</mark> in January, has replaced the insults and threats of war. Earlier--and much larger--springtime drills, which Washington and Seoul toned down, went off without the North's typically fiery condemnation or accompanying weapons tests. In Washington, the US State Department emphasised that Mr <mark>Kim</mark> had previously indicated he understood the need and purpose of the US continuing its long-planned exercises with South Korea. Read More Donald Trump confirms US is pulling out of Iran nuclear deal State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US had not heard anything directly from Pyongyang or Seoul that would change that. \"We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between President Trump and <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark>,\" Ms Nauert said. Army Colonel Rob Manning said this current exercise is part of the US and South Korea's \"routine, annual training program to maintain a foundation of military readiness\". Col Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said the purpose of Max Thunder and exercise Foal Eagle--another training event--is to enhance the two nations' abilities to operate together to defend South Korea. \"The defensive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed,\" said Col Manning. Washington and Seoul delayed an earlier round of drills in the spring because of the North-South diplomacy surrounding February's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South, which saw Mr <mark>Kim</mark> send his sister to the opening ceremonies. Mr <mark>Kim</mark> told visiting South Korean officials in March that he \"understands\" the drills would take place and expressed hope that they will be modified once the situation on the peninsula stabilises, according to the South Korean government.

The North's statement on Wednesday comes amid a slew of surprising moves from the North in recent weeks. On Tuesday, South Korea's military said North Korea was moving ahead with plans to close its nuclear test site next week, an assessment backed by US researchers who say satellite images show the North has begun dismantling facilities at the site. The site's closure was set to come before the Kim-Trump summit, which had been shaping up as a crucial moment in the decades-long push to resolve the nuclear standoff with the North, which is closing in on the ability to viably target the mainland United States with its long-range nuclear-armed missiles. Despite the North's moves, some experts were sceptical about whether Mr <mark>Kim</mark> would completely give up a nuclear programme that he had pushed so hard to build. Mr <mark>Kim</mark> has expressed his intention to negotiate over his weapons, but he still uses a long-contentious term, \"the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\". The North previously has used this phrase when demanding that the United States pull its 28,500 troops out of South Korea and withdraw its so-called \"nuclear umbrella\" security guarantee to South Korea and Japan as a condition for its nuclear disarmament. Wednesday's threat could also be targeted at showing a domestic audience that Mr <mark>Kim</mark> is willing to stand up to Washington. Mr <mark>Kim</mark> has repeatedly told his people that his nukes are a \"powerful treasured sword\" that can smash US hostility. North Korea also has a long history of launching provocations or scrapping deals with Seoul and Washington at the last minute. In 2013, North Korea abruptly cancelled reunions for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War just days before they were held to protest what it called rising animosities ahead of joint drills between Seoul and Washington. A year earlier in 2012, the North conducted a prohibited long-range rocket launch weeks after it agreed to suspend weapons tests in return for food assistance.

In 1789, eighteen years before slavery was abolished in Great Britain, <mark>William Blake</mark> published the poetry collection Songs of Innocence, among which is the poem \"Little Black Boy .\" <mark>Blake</mark> condemned slavery, which was evidence of the rampant racial inequality of his time (\"<mark>Blake</mark> and Wordsworth\" ). Interestingly, the same year that <mark>Blake</mark> published Songs of Innocence, the French stormed the Bastille, and the ideology of freedom initially upheld by the French revolutionaries was reflected in the goals of abolitionists, both American and British. Other materials were published that year, such as a description of a slave trade ship, a report on the slave trade, a speech about slavery by <mark>William</mark> Wilberforce in the House of Commons, and a former slave by the name of Olaudah Equiano published one of the first books by a black author (Wikipedia). Attitudes about race were changing for the better, leading to increased equality. In the 1960s, as in the US, there was more progress made towards racial equality. The UK passed the Race Relations Act in 1965, which was the first legislation addressing racial discrimination; in 1976 they passed new legislation with the same name, making racial discrimination illegal (EqualityHumanRights.com). <mark>William Blake</mark>'s poem \"The Little Black Boy\" uses racial imagery to convey spiritual truth and oppose the slave trade. The poem is as follows: My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child: But I am black as if bereav'd of light. My mother taught me underneath a tree And sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissed me, And pointing to the east began to say. Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive Comfort in morning joy in the noonday. And we are put on earth a little space, That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove. For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love & care, And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice. Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him and he will then love me. In this poem <mark>Blake</mark> writes from the perspective of a black slave boy in the southern U.S. to promote a biblical view of blacks as equal to whites. In line two, <mark>Blake</mark> states that the boy has a soul, despite the popular belief at the time that black people do not have souls (\"<mark>Blake</mark> and Wordsworth\" ). For slave owners, claiming that black people did not have souls served as a justification of their owning slaves and treating them like animals, who are also believed to lack souls. American and British slave owners who believed the Bible is God's word might have defended slavery by proof-texting a passage such as Ephesians 6:5, which tells slaves to obey their masters. Ephesians 6:5 defends slavery only if the literary and historical context is ignored; slaves in biblical times were often repaying a debt and were freed after their debt had been paid, unless they chose to remain the master's slave. <mark>Blake</mark> insinuates throughout the poem that all people, regardless of skin color, are equal in their relationship to God (lines 3, 9-14, 17-20, 22-28). This is a biblical idea; as Galatians 3:28 (NIV) says, \"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus .\" The black boy compares an English child to an angel because of his white skin, viewing himself as \"bereav'd of light\" (lines 3-4). It had been made clear to blacks that they were inferior to whites; it was ingrained in the culture and in their minds that they were lesser than whites, even when they were striving for equality. The culture, in this case, was wrong; all people are equal, because all are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27). All people are the same in a fundamental aspect, making them all equal. Equality in God's sight is <mark>Blake</mark>'s focus in \"Little Black Boy,\" though equality and fair treatment from whites was also important considering blacks were slaves, both in Britain and America. In lines thirteen and fourteen, the black slave boy relates what his mother taught him: \"And we are put on earth a little space, / That we may learn to bear the [sun] beams of love .\" The sun seems to symbolize the trials men face on earth. This is reminiscent of James 1:2 -4, which says, \"Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything\" (NIV). It seems from the black boy's hope that the English boy will one day love him that <mark>Blake</mark> saw a future day when whites would realize they were not superior to other races and equality would be gained. At the very least, the final lines emphasize that all of God's children are equal in His sight, or, as a popular phrase among Christians puts it, \"the ground is level at the cross .\" <mark>William Blake</mark> masterfully used racial imagery to teach his contemporaries about equality in Christ. It was surely not a popular message for slave owning Brits or Americans at the time, but it is a biblical one. The poem decries the prejudice inherent to racism and the slave trade and points readers to Christ. It was vital to the abolitionist movement that blacks be viewed and treated as equal to whites, and <mark>Blake</mark> communicated this well in \"Little Black Boy .\" Of course, racial equality did not stop there, and freedom for slaves was only the first step. A lot of progress has been made. Today on the internet there is an upsurge of racism, not towards \"people of color,\" generally, but towards whites. While some say things about \"reverse racism isn't real\" or similar things, racism is any prejudice against someone because of their skin color or race. All people should be viewed as equal insofar as they are human regardless of race.
