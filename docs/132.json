Federal regulations require an increase in biofuels starting next year. Six ethanol plants in Missouri turn corn into fuel for your car. John Eggleston, a farmer in Northern Missouri, sells his corn to the POET Ethanol Plant in Macon. \"It helps in the economics of what we receive as far as income because ethanol does help the overall market,\" Eggleston said. \"Ethanol has made the producer able to raise more acres of corn as long as the increasing technology is there to make higher yields.\" <mark>Steve Murphy</mark>, manager of Laddonia's POET plant, says the Renewable Fuel Standard could bring more money into Missouri's economy. \"In Missouri, agriculture is the biggest industry so it can have a huge ripple effect,\" <mark>Murphy</mark> said. The Laddonia plant receives all of its corn from Missouri farmers and generated 180 million dollars of economic activity last year. \"In Audrain County and in other rural counties, that's a big economic engine for fertilizers, for seeds, for fuel for all of the supplies farmers need and we provide a local source for them to sell their product,\" <mark>Murphy</mark> said. \"We are a big consumer of gasoline and yeah, it's going to have a tremendous impact because of the volume of gasoline that we have to maintain every year,\" Eggleston said. Nearly all of the ethanol produced at Laddonia stays in state. Missouri currently mandates ten percent of ethanol in regular gasoline. E85, which contains 85% ethanol, is an option at some gas stations. Opponents of increasing ethanol use say it would increase food prices, because farmers are working to produce crops for gas tanks instead of grocery stores. \"There are several ways the effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard on a national market could affect Missouri in terms of the corn prices that farmers get, the prices for corn or the distillers grains that farmers or feed lots might pay,\" Wyatt Thompson, MU Professor at Food and Agricultural Policy Institute (FAPRI), said. Thompson says increasing ethanol use could affect the price of food, but it would be small. <mark>Murphy</mark> adds that the corn used to make ethanol is not a sweet corn that you would buy at the grocery store. It's corn used for animal feed, which the plant sells back to farmers. \"Beef poultry pork prices can be affected but the acres planted have caught up with the demand the ethanol industry has put in,\" <mark>Murphy</mark> said. AAA also released a statement warning buyers: \"AAA's automotive engineering experts believe that sustained use of E15 could result in costly problems such as accelerated engine wear and failure, fuel-system damage and false\" check engine \"lights in some cars. An overwhelming 95 percent of consumers surveyed by AAA were not familiar with E15, indicating a strong likelihood of consumer confusion leading to misfueling.\" Filling up with E15 also causes your car to get worse gas mileage. The Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of E15 for all cars newer than 2001. Thompson says it's unclear whether the economy can meet the demands E15 might bring. \"Given what was going on in the markets it seems like the mandates were running against the blend wall and it was becoming harder to mandate,\" Thompson said. The blend wall is the limit on the amount of ethanol that can be used beyond E10. Thompson's research on this issue is ongoing. \"The EPA gave a signal that it might reduce the mandates, which it has the authority to do in 2014, so there's been a lot of debate about what sorts of levels might be appropriate,\" Thompson said. The Missouri Department of Agriculture recently proposed a rule change to add an E15 fuel, a blend of 15% ethanol in gasoline. Lawmakers decided in an October hearing they would have to go through the legislative process to approve the rule change."}, {"articleID": "2019053120_00065484_W", "names": {"Kevin Cooper": ["Q1740103", "Q19877167", "Q58150295", "Q6396066", "Q6584008"], "Jerry Brown": ["Q152451", "Q717620"]}, "date": "2019-05-31", "url": "http://mobile.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Kim-Kardashian-visited-San-Quentin-kevin-cooper-13912025.php", "content": "Kim Kardashian visited San Quentin's death row on Thursday Michelle Robertson, SFGATE | on May 31, 2019 In this file photo taken on June 16, 2018 US TV personality Kim Kardashian attends the 2018 MTV Movie & TV awards, at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica.

Photo: Valerie Macon, AFP/Getty Images Kim Kardashian visited San Quentin's death row on Thursday 1 / 22 Back to Gallery Kim Kardashian West continued her prison reform crusade with a Thursday visit to San Quentin State Prison. Gossip site TMZ spotted West entering the prison Thursday, where she reportedly spent two hours chatting with death-row inmate <mark>Kevin Cooper</mark>. A spokesperson for the California prison system would not confirm West's visit with SFGATE for privacy reasons. <mark>Cooper</mark>, 61, was convicted of four murders in Chino Hills, Calif., in the 1980s and sent directly to death row. Since the conviction, <mark>Cooper</mark> has vehemently asserted his innocence and protested racism in the criminal justice system as well as the death penalty. In 2018, after widespread media coverage of <mark>Cooper</mark>'s case--some of which put forth the possibility that <mark>Cooper</mark> had been framed for the Chino Hills murders--Former Governor of California <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> ordered new DNA testing of the evidence. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has suspended state executions since taking office, expanded the order in February. The testing is ongoing. Related Stories Kim Kardashian West shares picture studying for law exam West, who is studying to become a lawyer at a San Francisco law firm, has been publicly involved with the <mark>Cooper</mark> case since last year. In June, she tweeted: \"Governor <mark>Brown</mark>, can you please test the DNA of <mark>Kevin Cooper</mark>?\" During her Thursday visit with <mark>Cooper</mark>, West \"spent 2 hours with him and is more convinced than ever he was framed,\" TMZ reported. Last year, she played a crucial role in the release of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman imprisoned since 1996 on nonviolent drug charges. West plans to take the bar in 2022 and began an apprenticeship at a law firm last summer. Michelle Robertson is an SFGATE producer.

bulldog sports talk <mark>greg byrne</mark>: secret agent man by brad locke <mark>greg byrne</mark> for his mastery of covert ops during this coach search. dude must have navy seal training or something. from what i've gathered, he's either a) kept the big-shot boosters completely in the dark, or b) he's found a way to keep them quiet. people say boosters hire coaches, but i'm not so sure in this case. i tried calling <mark>byrne</mark> this morning to gauge his reaction to sylvester croom's recent public comments, and then i texted him a few minutes ago. he said on the day croom resigned that he would not speak to the media about the search until a coach was hired, and i guess he's through talking about croom. speaking of croom, in light of the revelation that there was going to be a change at offensive coordinator, i do wonder what else, if anything, <mark>byrne</mark> wanted croom to change. maybe croom could elaborate, but that would require returning my call. but i digress. <mark>byrne</mark> can't keep everyone quiet. as i and/or others have already noted, he was in kansas city over the weekend - ostensibly to see oklahoma offensive coordinator <mark>kevin wilson</mark>, and perhaps others - and florida offensive coordinator dan mullen has possibly been in touch with msu. and south carolina defensive coordinator <mark>ellis johnson</mark>, formerly of msu, has expressed interest in the position but has had no formal discussions with state. we don't know what the heck is up with boise state's <mark>chris petersen</mark>. we don't know much at all, do we? i can't wait until <mark>byrne</mark> announces a new hire - and that's another thing, will anyone break the story before he does? - so that we can ask him how he pulled this off. possibly

one side or the other. it means all of them. another angle is president of what? maybe the attack dog club. or the blind loyalists committee? i'm not the biggest fan of the new england style communication with the media, but in this case i'm not all that upset. every single suggestion that it's simply a matter of time until brady supplants orton is predicated on this kid doing what he has yet to do in the nfl. he's not some amazing freak of nature that just needs to glance at the playbook. he's been overrated his whole career, throws just as shaky a deep ball as orton, and has played in a \"variant\" of this system, but not this system. he's a cast off from cleveland. period. quinn will be a good backup. if he evolves to be some amazing starter and helps us win games, well then glory be! but right now, he's just a dude who has not lived up to the hype. there are plenty of better stories this offseason. like some of the other readers here, i am really excited to see what martindale can do with the defense. i'm likining what i'm seeing, and would love to see us develop depth at the d-line where we have traditionally ran thin. if we settle for anything less than a first rounder for <mark>marshall</mark>, it better be a haul. the state of the broncos today can be summed up like this: somehow it is \"exciting\" for some that there might be a quarterback competition between two has beens who never were, kyle orton and brady quinn. virtually everywhere else in the nfl save perhaps oakland you would be laughed at if given these two choices. lets put this in perspective, if rex grossman can beat out kyle orton, why couldnt quinn? heres a quote from josh last march. \"he's our quarterback and - and - we will always do what's in the best interests of our football team,\" mcdaniels said. \"but we're committed to him, and i'm looking forward to him being back. and as long as that's the case and we're both committed to each other, then he'll absolutely be our quarterback in the opener.\" missingnyc wrote: i don't understand what's with mcdaniels unwavering support for orton...he's just an average qb, he's no peyton manning. mcd is slobbering and

touchdown pass to bennett giving the commodores their first victory over tennessee in two decades. cutler's importance to the commodores was clear in narrow vanderbilt losses. with a 4-0 record on the line versus mtsu, cutler guided the commodores 80 yards for a last-second field goal that would have provided the winning margin, only to have the attempt blocked. in two late-season road games, south carolina and florida, cutler directed two-touchdown, fourth quarter comebacks to give the commodores a chance to win. in the home finale versus kentucky, cutler threw for four second half touchdowns

buy both my kids a kyle orton jersey. if you were wondering...in 2008, the denver broncos offense was 3rd in the league with a 47.5 3rd down efficiency (indy was 1st, new orleans was 2nd)... but i'm sure some mcd apologist will find a way to spin a drop of 11% and 19 places in the league as a sign the offense is getting better. why aren't these the things being reported in the dp instead of butt

significant strides, though. ultimately that analysis is going to be subjective, and the coaching staff is going to be the one making the decision. unfortunately, nobody calls to ask my opinion on these matters. in all seriousness, though, hopefully those\" strides \"are significant enough for even the most adamant doubters to recognize. if he improves in half of the areas you mentioned, i would think that something like 10-6 and perhaps even a playoff win could be in the cards. let the ridicule begin. my skin is feeling extra thick today.\" yep. no question, \"broncos coach josh mcdaniels said here monday at the nfl meetings.\" he's earned it. he's a guy who made the most of an opportunity he was given last year. it's really hard to say whether or not mcdaniels' public praise of orton is genuine or not. listening to troy aikman during the dallas/denver game last year, orton is a fantastic practice player...makes all the throws, makes all the right reads, good rhythm. but that is not translating to game day. it makes a big difference when a 260 pound man with 4.6 speed is running at you with intent to do great bodily harm...and you've got to stand there, make your reads and make an accurate throw right before that animal turns you into a tackling dummy. the last thing a head coach wants to do is bury his starting qb verbally in the media (although apparently it's okay to do it to your 2 time pro bowl wr) even if he doesn't believe his qb is great. last year, i was clamoring for son of simms to get some snaps. when he did, i was clamoring for them to put orton back in...there was no competition at the qb position because son of simms was zero competition and tater was a puppy. but i've gotta believe that deep down, mcd knows orton is not gonna go moses for bronco nation and lead us to the promise land. however, that's the option he's looking at right now and the last thing he wants to do is destroy the confidence of a guy who, let's be honest, doesn't exude the swagger of an upper echelon nfl qb but if he improves in a lot of areas can allow our playmakers (royal, <mark>marshall</mark>, stokley, um...gaffney?) to make plays. \"yep. no

You have to keep it in play.\" No one might do that better this weekend than circuit leader Scott McCarron. He has two wins and over $1.3 million in earnings so far this season--nearly $500,000 more than last week's Senior PGA Championship winner, Ken Tanigawa--and scored his first senior win in Iowa in 2016. McCarron has won nine more times since then. He has also finished in the top 10 in seven tournaments in 2019. McCarron and Tanigawa, who rallied from three shots down to beat McCarron by one stroke last weekend, will play together again Friday in the opening round. They will be joined by 2017 Iowa winner Brandt Jobe. All three went to UCLA and have remained close friends. \"Having the lead right now really doesn't mean too much,\" McCarron said. \"But I can keep increasing that lead, and that's what I'm trying to do. I want to go into the playoffs with a big enough lead that I can secure this thing up.\" Langer, who entered the week ranked third on the money list, withdrew Thursday to attend the funeral of his son's father-in-law. Langer always seemed to struggle at Wakonda, but he'd begun to turn it around in recent seasons.

The chief philosophical influence of an American neo-Nazi extremist group that is the subject of a nationwide FBI crackdown and is believed to be on the cusp of being declared a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department, is claiming in an audio message obtained by Motherboard that the group is disbanding. In the recording, <mark>James Mason</mark>, a longtime figure within the U.S. neo-Nazi movement and the author of what's considered an important work in the racist canon of the far-right, claims to officially announce the demise of Atomwaffen Division, a group that has become synonymous in recent years with white nationalist terrorism and is linked to five murders. \"This is a press announcement from <mark>James Mason</mark> on the evening of March 9 of this year,\" said <mark>Mason</mark>, who is known to be an advisor to the group and has made personal appearances in some of its propaganda videos. \"I was approached by members of the group known as Atomwaffen Division with the request that I make the official announcement of that group's disbanding, effective at once.\" Motherboard spoke to sources familiar with <mark>Mason</mark>'s voice who believe it to be him on the recording, which is already circulating online. While the statement does not necessarily prove the group or its supporters are abandoning their activities, it does show the sustained pressure by federal authorities is having a negative effect on the militant neo-Nazi movement. In late February, the FBI arrested five members of the group, including its former leader <mark>John Cameron</mark> Denton, 26, who goes by the online alias \"Rape,\" for allegedly swatting journalists and members of the Trump Administration. A month earlier the FBI announced the arrest of six members of The Base, another neo-Nazi terror group linked to Atomwaffen Division, on charges of planning assassinations and mass shootings. Federal prosectors in Virginia where Denton is being tried recently alleged in court the former leader shared child pornography with another unnamed individual. In 1992, <mark>Mason</mark>, known for his writings advocating for a white ethnostate, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of possessing child pornography. <mark>Mason</mark> made it clear in the latest recording that the notice of disbanding comes on the heels of FBI pressure on the group. \"Over the course of past weeks and months, the level and degree of federal infiltration and the numerous arrests stemming from that have so severely hampered the group's ability to function as a group that it would be pointless to even pretend that anything resembling organizational activity could continue,\" he said. <mark>Mason</mark> went on to declare, \"anything found on the internet henceforth claiming to be or bearing the mark of Atomwaffen Division\" was to be considered an impostor. Last fall, a group claiming to be Atomwaffen Division released a widely circulated propaganda video, which was swiftly denounced by <mark>Mason</mark> as a fraud.
