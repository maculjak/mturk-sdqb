of trading as a public company on friday, with shares jumping 31 percent. the chicago-based daily deals company's shares, trading as grpn on the nasdaq, opened at $20 per share and quickly rose $7.71 to $27.71. by midday, shares were up 46 percent, or $9.24 to $29.24. they closed at $26.10, up 31 percent. groupon priced its ipo late thursday, raising $700 million and garnering a valuation of $12.76 billion. pricing for the ipo came in above groupon's initial anticipated price range of $16 to $18, which would have resulted in a valuation between $10.1 billion and $11.4 billion. groupon raised the number of shares it is selling from 30 million to 35 million, but this still represents just 5.5 percent of the company and is considered a small float compared with typical ipos. in its regulatory filings, the company had cautioned that the relative scarcity of its stock could lead to volatility in the share price, given the imbalance between supply and demand. groupon's underwriters have the option of selling an additional 5.25 million shares. the friday debut on nasdaq capped off a tumultuous journey for groupon, which went from tech darling to the poster child of a new tech bubble during the five-month prelude to the ipo. while the $12.76 billion valuation falls below early chatter of $30 billion, it's above the nearly $6 billion that google offered for the company in late 2010. groupon chief executive <mark>andrew mason</mark> was in new york to ring the nasdaq opening bell on friday. he also posted a short message on the company's official blog that contained no trace of the quirky humor or references to cats that have marked his other correspondence. \"our ipo is a small milestone on our journey,\" <mark>mason</mark> wrote. he added: \"i feel incredibly grateful to serve as ceo of groupon. with our ipo behind us, i couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead .\" \"it's a ridiculous policy'--<mark>john williams</mark> talks about the case of the

coming off a 99-loss season, the twins aren't planning a major front office shake-up, but they are working on some important tweaks. the team is close to rehiring former assistant general manager wayne krivsky, likely as a special assistant to gm <mark>bill smith</mark>. krivsky could have a deal with the twins by next week, people familiar with the discussions said friday. another priority is keeping vice president of player personnel mike radcliff. this week, the twins denied the orioles permission to interview radcliff for baltimore's vacant general manager job. citing an industry source, the mid-atlantic sports network reported friday that the twins denied permission \"because of internal reorganization and promotions that could be in the works .\" twins officials later explained that radcliff's title won't be changing--at least not now--but the plan is to have the former scouting director focus less on amateur scouting, allowing him to concentrate more on the major league club's specific needs. it's not clear whether radcliff had any interest in baltimore's job. he declined to comment friday, as did <mark>smith</mark>. twins president dave st. peter said, \"we are not going to comment on another team's staffing issue and/or executive search .\" the twins have enough on their own plate, trying to bounce back from a 63-99 season. it wasn't a good year for the front office, which raised the payroll to a franchise-record $115 million and sunk to last place. many recent trades--including wilson ramos to washington for matt capps, j.j. hardy to baltimore for jim hoey and delmon young to detroit for lester oliveros--have turned into duds for the twins and boons for the other team. under former gm <mark>terry ryan</mark>, the twins were often on the other side of lopsided deals, such as the one that sent a.j. pierzynski to san francisco for joe nathan, boof bonser and francisco liriano. krivsky was <mark>ryan</mark>'s top talent advisor for that 2003 trade, and others. after the 2005 season, krivsky left to become the reds gm. in cincinnati, he acquired future all-stars bronson arroyo, <mark>brandon phillips</mark> and <mark>josh hamilton</mark>, but his reds teams combined to go 161-184. in april 2008, reds owner bob castellini executed a squeeze play, replacing krivsky with walt jocketty. krivsky, 57, went on to become a special assistant for the orioles and mets, but he has told people he longs for a return to the twins. the twins have spoken with krivsky about a role that would return him to pro scouting--he was the team's top national league scout under <mark>ryan</mark>--and they would look to him for advice on trades and contract signings. the team's current inner circle includes <mark>smith</mark>, radcliff, assistant gm rob antony and <mark>ryan</mark>, who serves as a senior advisor. all worked with krivsky for years and would welcome him back into the fold. 11/6/11 12:00 pm kansas city 11/5/11 11:00 am (15)

further details about the refurbishment of his downing street flat under the freedom of information act. information commissioner <mark>christopher graham</mark> has ruled that the prime minister must disclose what work was done on the bathroom to the apartment at number 11, where he lives with his wife samantha and their three children. it emerged earlier this year that the camerons had spent the entire? 30,000 budget available to prime ministers annually for upkeep and improvements to his downing street flat. officials stressed that the costs charged to the taxpayer did not cover furniture, fixtures and fittings, but things such as electrics, plumbing, structural alterations and decorating. additional costs in the refit beyond the? 30,000 publicly funded allowance were met by the family. labour mp <mark>tom watson</mark> has been asking the cabinet office for details of the changes to the bathroom and any instructions given to contractors by mr and mrs <mark>cameron</mark>. the sunday telegraph disclosed that, having rejected the request, the cabinet office has now been told by mr <mark>graham</mark>'s office that he \"does not accept\" its decision. \"in particular the commissioner considers it unlikely that planning for refurbishment works at downing street would take place without the involvement of the cabinet office as the relevant government department,\" he said. the commissioner also raised concerns about delays in responding to mr <mark>watson</mark>'s request, which was submitted in june last year. mr <mark>watson</mark>, the shadow cabinet office minister, said: \"downing street is a grade one listed building and one of the jewels in the nation's crown. taxpayers have a right to know what the temporary residents are doing to such a historic building .\" a number 10 spokesman said mr <mark>graham</mark>'s letter had been received. aston clinton family loses battle with council over illegal extension two men taken to hospital after serious
