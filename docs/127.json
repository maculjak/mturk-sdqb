Comments This is a good, spiritual event, but you don't hear anyone talking about the homeless. \"Lanir Evans PHILADELPHIA--As Pope Francis prepared to take the podium at Independence Hall, a group of 15 men and women departed from Chosen 300 Ministries. They weren't tardy pilgrims making the last-minute trip. They set out on foot, guiding hand carts full of food and water across a mile of cracked pavement, over cement barriers and through the long line at a security checkpoint en route to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The group typically makes its deliveries via car .\" We've been doing this every Saturday for 19 years, \"said Executive Director <mark>Brian Jenkins</mark>, as he led the procession down an eerily vacant Broad Street .\" We're not going to miss a day. \"The parkway, a thoroughfare that runs from City Hall down to the Museum of Art, has become the epicenter of the pope's visit with key stops and a parade along its length. But it also has long housed a large contingent of Philadelphia's homeless population. In a city with a fraught history of dealing with its poorest citizens, preparations for dealing with the homeless during Pope Francis' visit began many months ago. It involved the relocation of homeless residents from the papal security zones, although they were allowed to re-enter certain areas--such as the parade route--on Friday morning. <mark>Jenkins</mark> and a number of the homeless themselves say Philadelphia displaced a group of people for whom the pope has become a strong advocate. City officials say their efforts were a necessary part of the Secret Service protocols and that they were particularly sensitive to the needs of the homeless .\" The city failed and they put the homeless last on the agenda, \"said <mark>Jenkins</mark>, whose group was one of four charities who successfully sued to block the city's ban on feeding the homeless in 2012. Marie Nahikian, the city's director of supportive housing, said the sweeps of the parkway and Independence Mall succeeded with some homeless individuals where previous outreach attempts had failed. In all, some 200 residents were directed to shelters and other resources made available during the pope's visit .\" We know many of those residents by name, \"she said .\" We've spent a lot of energy, with our nonprofit partners, making sure everyone understood what was going to happen. \"A number of those homeless residents accepted help from the teams for the first time during the lead-up to the pope's visit, Nahikian said. That was due, in large part, to the increased manpower funneled into the effort .\" Certainly, the additional resources helped, \"she said .\" People, by and large, don't want to be homeless. They just need to understand and trust that they can make a better choice. \"<mark>Sue Smith</mark>, vice president of residential and homeless programs for Project HOME, said the homeless were inconvenienced about as much as the average resident--no more or less. The nonprofit provides social services, including homeless outreach teams, through a contract with the city .\" So far, everyone sort of understands that these are strange times, \"she said .\" Whether you're homeless or not, you're going to be inconvenienced. \"Based on what she had seen, <mark>Smith</mark> said nobody was forced to do anything. In at least one case, she said, an individual with a shopping cart full of possessions was able to take them with her in a van. <mark>Smith</mark> said a normal late-night shift may have one or two outreach teams working citywide. Nahikian, meanwhile, said six teams were on the ground for the sweeps on Thursday and Friday. During the pope's visit on Saturday and Sunday, five teams and one back-up team were working to respond to any homeless individuals in distress. Adam Bruckner, another homeless advocate who has been critical of the city's past policies, said its plan for the papal visit looks good on paper. But it's too soon to judge how well it actually worked in practice, said Bruckner, who heads Philly Restart, a nonprofit that provides ID to homeless residents, among other programs .\" It has not been for lack of planning, \"he said .\" I think they're very aware that this is a big issue. They don't want to look to be against the homeless at the same time the pope is in town. \"The city has also distributed meal vouchers for the homeless to use during the pope's visit, although <mark>Jenkins</mark> said he's heard of many people who have yet to see them. Those who did reported that the vouchers were for eateries outside of the papal security zone. Eva Gladstein, who lead's Mayor Michael Nutter's Office of Community Empowerment and Opportunity, said she has not heard of any problems associated with the vouchers. The city meanwhile, had already reached an agreement that would allow <mark>Jenkins</mark>' group to distribute food within the security zone, Gladstein said. Even so, the process would still be difficult .\" Logistically, even finding the (distribution) site would be difficult given the number of people there, \"she said. <mark>Jenkins</mark> said the city's agreement allowed Chosen 300 to use a vehicle to haul the food. Unfortunately, he said, the parking spot was just three blocks closer to the parkway from the charity's headquarters. Homeless During Pope Francis Visit <mark>Brian Jenkins</mark>, of Chosen 300 Ministries, led a group of volunteers bringing food to homeless along the Pope Francis parade route. That ultimately prompted the group to make its journey across a mile of cordoned-off city streets to its usual spot near JFK Plaza along the parkway. At one point, the contents of the carts--chicken wings, potato salad, chips and water--had to be offloaded in order to get through concrete barriers .\" I wonder if (Pope Francis) knew what we were doing, would he really be down there? \"Jason Doctor, one of the volunteers, muttered as the group approached a checkpoint at 15 th Street and Cherry. Once the group arrived, they were detained as agents tried to determine whether they could pass through the checkpoint. A half-hour later, they were waved through. A group of people began to converge upon Chosen 300's impromptu food kitchen almost as soon as the carts were unloaded near JFK Plaza .\" He assured us he'd be here today and he is, \"said Russell Price, 62, who was driven to the streets after a fire destroyed his apartment two years ago. He has come to rely on <mark>Jenkins</mark>' group to help out. The presence of thousands of papal spectators lined up along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a short distance away, wasn't lost on Price and the others .\" The pope is supposed to be for these people, \"he said .\" Why is Bryan the only one out here? \"A similar sentiment came from Lanir Evans, 48, a former cook who was left homeless amid mounting medical bills related to blood clots found in his brain. His father recently helped pay for a room to keep him off the streets, but Evans still comes down to the open-air food line when his own pantry runs bare .\" This is a good, spiritual event, \"he said, motioning to the throngs of faithful around him,\" but you don't hear anyone talking about the homeless. \""}, {"articleID": "2014041602_00014782_W", "names": {"Bill Brown": ["Q16188871", "Q2667644", "Q27147689", "Q4908278", "Q4908280", "Q4908282", "Q4908284", "Q4908288", "Q4908289", "Q4908293", "Q861987"]}, "date": "2014-04-15", "url": "http://www.independent.com/news/2014/apr/15/morua-pleads-guilty-dui-and-fatal-hit-and-run-char/", "content": "Morua Pleads Guilty to DUI and Fatal Hit-and-Run Charges Will Be Sentenced to 20 Years to Life in Prison Judge James Voysey (center) accepts guilty pleas from Raymond Morua (right) with attorney Darryl Genis Morua appeared in court dressed in a dark suit and shed silent tears as he pleaded guilty to felony charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (which carries a sentence of 15 years to life) and fleeing the scene (which carries a sentence of 5 years).

The concern now is what the government intends to use it for. Transcript EMMA ALBERICI, PRESENTER: Some time in the past decade, what it means to be a \"private citizen\" changed. Tonight, we're going to examine the concept of privacy. What does it mean any more? And what's the Government doing snooping around our metadata? Shortly we'll cross to the US to speak to Bruce Schneier. He's one of the world's leading experts in online security. But before we get to that, let's talk about just how much of what we do and say is being tracked. EDWARD SNOWDEN, NSA WHISTLEBLOWER (The Guardian online, July 2014): Why are our private details that are transmitted online, why are our private details that are stored on our personal devices any different than the details and private records of our lives that are stored in our private journals? EMMA ALBERICI: Edward Snowden blew the whistle on how states and corporations are furiously scooping up what we thought was our private information. In the main, we don't think too much of protecting ourselves from the prying eyes of the Government. It's the trade-off, right? For the great convenience of having a phone in your pocket that's also an internet connection, a gaming tool, cinema and recording device. Giving up some of our privacy also doesn't seem so bad if it means we'll all be safer; if it's going to help authorities catch terrorists. But are we giving away too much? Australians wouldn't cop it when the Hawke government tried to introduce the Australia Card. Back in the mid-80s, they wanted us all tagged and numbered on one centralised ID card combining information from 13 government agencies into one database. You'd have to present your card to open a bank account, buy or sell real estate or get a job. All that was to stop tax and welfare cheats. But opposition came fast from both the left and the right. <mark>JOHN HOWARD</mark>, FMR OPPOSITION LEADER (1987): It accumulates an enormous store of information on all of us throughout the country. PETER GARRETT, MIDNIGHT OIL (1987): By numbering Australians, we now ensure that governments of the future can control us. EMMA ALBERICI: The Australia Card, though, was nothing compared to what's being proposed today. And this time the idea is supported by both major parties. They want internet and phone companies to store all our so-called metadata for two years. They want to keep the times and dates of your phone calls, how long the calls lasted, who you spoke to and from where the call was made. Likewise for your emails: where and when they were sent and received and who they were sent to. The actual content of your calls and emails won't be included, but police will have access to all the rest without the need for a warrant. Companies are already collecting all this information. The concern now is what the Government intends to use it for. Margot O'Neill conducted a little social experiment on how much we value our privacy.

(Customer 4 laughs) EMMA O'NEILL, REPORTER: Every hour, every day, we're haemorrhaging personal details on the internet: what we buy, where we are, who we contact. We're being harvested, often surreptitiously. We wouldn't put up with it in the real world, which made us wonder: what if a shop assistant behaved like an online app? CAFE EMPLOYEE: Can I have your email then? CUSTOMER 5: My email (laughs)? CAFE EMPLOYEE: Your email. CUSTOMER 5 (laughing): No. . No. . CAFE EMPLOYEE: We want to try to provide a better service. CUSTOMER 6: You want to provide a better service in knowing what I did, 8 o'clock at night? CAFE EMPLOYEE: Yep. CUSTOMER 6: For what reason? CAFE EMPLOYEE: Just provide a better service. CUSTOMER 6: Explain it to me. EMMA O'NEILL: Our little hidden camera experiment was inspired by a recent Danish consumer campaign, which also shows that people don't like sharing personal information with strangers. CUSTOMER 1 (Danish consumer advertisement, translation): My telephone number? (Laughs) Then I want yours too. CUSTOMER 2 (Danish consumer advertisement, translation): No way. No, I refuse. EMMA O'NEILL: There's so many slick, fast, convenient services because of the digital economy. But the price is a slice of your life. Apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Messenger, to name just a few, can access your contacts, calendar, messages, photos, texts and your location data - which, by the way, may not be considered personal information under Australian law. Hey, check this out: deep in my privacy settings there's a thing called \"frequent location\" which shows exactly when and where, for how long I've been, even providing a handy little map. I think I'll just be turning that off. The average Australian now connects to the internet through four or five different devices: smart phones, tablets, PCs, laptops, TVs, work computers. From morning to night, your digital exhaust is logged for the global information economy. And most of us don't really understand what that means. Behind every keystroke there's a global buyer's market, itching to target who they think you are. Searching for a holiday, an abortion clinic, a cure for herpes: Google and its advertisers go there with you. (to Wade Alcorn) Is it our fault? Are we not reading privacy policies? WADE ALCORN, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: I think those privacy policies are massive and you pretty much need a legal degree to understand them. (excerpt from AAMI advertisement) ACTOR (AAMI Safe Driver App advertisement): Are you ready for this? ACTOR (AAMI Safe Driver App advertisement): Bring it on, muchacho. EMMA O'NEILL: Using AAMI's safe driving app, AAMI hopes it will help uncover dangerous traffic spots to make the road safer. But it can also record when you speed or if you're in an accident. And it could turn over that data to the police if legally required to do so. AAMI says currently the data won't negatively affect insurance premiums, but there's no guarantees about the future. (excerpt ends) EMMA O'NEILL: And that's true of just about all data collection: it can be repurposed. WADE ALCORN: Maybe in a few years' time they can use it in a whole different way that isn't what you initially intended when you provided them access to your data. EMMA O'NEILL: Mega-data corporations like Google and Facebook say, \"Don't worry. The data's anonymous. Only machines read it to better target personal ads .\" But Stanford University researchers found that by analysing even limited information from mobile phones, they could predict individual medical conditions, hobbies and relationships. WADE ALCORN: For example, your GPS data: possibly, if an application is tracking where you're going, they may be releasing that information or, rather, selling that information on around how often you visit the doctor. EMMA O'NEILL: Companies also say we can trust them to keep the data safe. (excerpt from the film \"The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring') IAN McKELLEN (as Gandalf): Keep it secret. Keep it safe. (excerpt ends) EMMA O'NEILL: But last year computer hack attacks surged worldwide by 48 per cent. In Australia, companies don't have to tell the public if their information has been compromised. Some experts say there's really only two types of organisations: WADE ALCORN: Ones that have been hacked and ones that don't know they've been hacked. EMMA O'NEILL: And if it's not crooks hacking your data, governments want your stuff. All of it, apparently. The US electronic spy agency, the NSA, is like an intelligence super-trawler slurping up everything it can from internet servers around the world, including Australia. (excerpt from the film\" Signs'. Two children are wearing hats made of aluminium foil) RORY CULKIN (as Morgan): So the aliens can't read our minds. (excerpt ends) EMMA O'NEILL: It's no wonder encryption is becoming more popular. Getting off the grid is even becoming cool: like fashion wear with shield pockets to block mobile phone signals. Just ask Malcolm Turnbull. The Federal Communications Minister admits using the secret messaging app Wickr, which encrypts and then destroys messages. (to Wade Alcorn) Do you use encryption? WADE ALCORN: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. For business purposes, to ensure that communications are secure and also for personal communication as well. EMMA O'NEILL: And what should you do when you're asked to give up personal details? (footage of caf\u00e9) CAFE EMPLOYEE: Can I have your e mail? CUSTOMER 7: No, I don't hand out my private information. CAFE EMPLOYEE: OK. Can I have your phone number please? CUSTOMER 7: No, unfortunately not. You can't have that either. JUANITA PHILLIPS, NEWSREADER (ABC News, Feb. 10): The technology giant Samsung has admitted that its new Smart TV could be eavesdropping. EMMA O'NEILL: Now, you probably don't want to hear this but the potential to hack your life is about to get much worse. A new wave of wearable technology, like the Apple Watch, will be able to transmit every heartbeat, every footstep, every REM sleep cycle. And in the next decade, a looming tsunami of sensor-driven technology built into your home, your car, your office will mean just about every gadget from your desk chair to your fridge will be able to gossip about you on the internet. Cyber privacy is dead and we all have to get over it. At least, that's what Silicon Valley executives have been predicting for the last 15 years. No-one could have predicted how quickly, how willingly we would just give away our privacy. And there's no going back. But with technology now running so far ahead of consumer awareness and legal safeguards, a fight-back may be stirring. You can Google it - or maybe not .----------------------------------In response to a story posted by ABC News Online, AAMI provided the following statement: \"We are very disappointed in ABC Lateline's web story this afternoon on the AAMI Safe Driver App. We view running such a piece based on highly unlikely scenarios as scaremongering .\" The intention of the app was never to collect data to provide to police nor have the police request data from us.

Should you give to this good cause or that, buy one charity's Christmas cards or another's? It's a strain on both principles and wallet. Nevertheless, there is one cause that is exceptional, and so worthy of your immediate attention that you will be ashamed for not thinking of these poor souls before. Yes, it's billionaires. Loading article content The Swiss bank UBS estimates there are 1542 of them in the world. America has the most (563), then China (318) and Germany (117). If you prefer your good causes to be local, the UK has 55. Their plight came to light this week with the sale of Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi for \u00a3 341 million--the highest price ever paid for a painting. Searching for an explanation as to why anyone would hand over so much, the Today programme turned to Georgina Adam, author of Dark Side of the Boom: The Excesses of the Art Market in the 21st Century (yours for a very reasonable \u00a3 19.99 on Amazon, as owned by Jeff Bezos, the world's number one billionaire). Ms Adam said the market was being fuelled by \"the sheer amount of money that billionaires have\". If you are worth tens of billions, \u00a3 341 million is not a huge chunk out of one's fortune. Suddenly, the plight of billionaires became all too clear. It's supply and demand, innit? There are only so many London townhouses, Manhattan apartments, yachts, diamonds, bottles of rare wine and private islands in the world. Yet the number of folk who want to buy them is increasing in number, and the mountain of money they have to spend is growing by the second. The market cannot meet the demands being placed on it. How could Marx not foresee such a glaring deficiency in the capitalist system? Too busy fretting about class struggle to predict there would one day be billionaires scrambling to find things to spend money on. I jest, of course. Any billionaire worth his or her salt and place in heaven can easily find a home for their money in a good cause, and many do. What the likes of the da Vinci painting, and before that the Paradise Papers leak, make clear, however, is the increasing gulf between the super rich and the rest of us. They don't just live in bigger homes; they might as well be on a different planet. Here on Earth, in the UK to be precise, we are about to have our own ponder about haves and have nots. It's Budget time, when we turn back the political clocks and pretend that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has ability to make huge differences to millions of lives with one speech to the Commons. Yet that has not been the case for some time. Budgets used to be momentous events, now they largely exist as political theatre, an occasion for Westminster to dress up and think of how it used to be. But the days of Jenkins, Healey, Lawson, even Brown and those extra billions for the NHS in his 2000 Budget, are gone. Only accountants, think tanks and the media can get excited about Budgets now. One could blame globalisation, the crash of 2008, or a looming Brexit, but there is also the not inconsiderable problem every Chancellor now faces: the Great British public has become allergic to income tax rises. As with full percentage hikes in the interest rate, an electorate worn down by stagnant pay and rising prices simply won't tolerate being asked to hand over more. Denied the means to bring in the big bucks via income tax, Chancellors are forced to tinker around the margins, nipping here and tucking there. Not every party, of course, agrees that tax rises are taboo. Labour's Shadow Chancellor, <mark>John McDonnell</mark>, said this week he would raise an extra \u00a3 17 billion through taxes to spend on public services. Scotland, the First Minister has promised, is to have its own great debate on tax. Given the outcry in some quarters over the SNP Government's freezing of the 40p threshold, and this week's row over how many Scots were paying more in tax than their counterparts in England, any \"debate\" is going to be of the stairheid variety. Or will Scotland buck the perceived trend on income tax the way it has with minimum pricing for alcohol? In the meantime, prepare for a lot of sound, perhaps even fury, after <mark>Philip Hammond</mark> resumes his seat next Wednesday afternoon. And don't worry. Unless he is getting ready to pull the mother and father of rabbits out of his hat, his Budget will contain nothing to trouble any billionaires on the hunt for that next special something to buy. Small seasonal mercies, eh? GRUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE THERE is something about the Johnson family that reminds me of the old story about Mike and Bernie Winters at the Glasgow Empire. You know the one: Mike comes on stage to a tumbleweed welcome, Bernie joins him, only for someone to shatter the silence with the cry: \"Oh God, there's two of them!\" Except in the case of the Johnsons there are more than two. Among the most prominent are Boris the Foreign Secretary, Jo the Universities Minister, Rachel the columnist, and their father Stanley, whose long list of jobs includes writer and conservationist. Now Stanley is to take part in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!, which starts its annual run tomorrow. For those who have been holed up in an Australian rainforest for the past 15 years, I'm A Celeb is an ITV reality show in which a group of people, many of whom you have never heard, endure all sorts of indignities to win food for their campmates. The 77-year-old is favourite to win, too. One way or another there is just no escaping the blonde ambitions of the Johnsons. HIGH FIVE TO ONE BRAVE DOG HERE'S to Mali, the eight-year-old dog yesterday awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal for his contribution to a British Special Forces assault on a Taliban position in Kabul. The citation says the Belgian Malinois \"displayed outstanding courage in the face of fire\" and there was no doubt that his actions, including searching for explosives, had helped to save lives. Mali was hit by shrapnel during the 2012 assault, but carried on despite his injuries. Taking their name from Maria Dickin, founder of the PDSA, the medals were first handed out in 1943. Over the years they have gone to dogs, cats, horses, pigeons and other creatures. Just as no human knows how they will fare under fire till it happens, so it is hard to imagine our pets in such extreme circumstances. Take a look at that big lump on the sofa (the dog, not your other half), or that little darling who has just stormed through the door demanding her dinner (the cat, not the daughter). Are they the stuff of medal winners? In the eyes of those who love them, too right they are. 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2015012910_00044565_W", "names": {"David Cameron": ["Q1173911", "Q16195447", "Q18719363", "Q192", "Q47345547", "Q51808902", "Q5232111"]}, "date": "2015-01-29", "url": "http://www.cbronline.com/news/uk-oracle-user-groups-ceo-resigns-for-career-break-4499322", "content": "James Haslam, who joined in July 1997, is leaving UKOUG on 6 March 2015.

was well aware of the streak, the one that finally ended when roy halladay (of all people) crossed home plate in the third inning saturday night. \"it was 38 innings, but we put one across,\" a smirking manuel said. frank franklin ii / associated press so he was keeping track? \"four games plus two innings,\" he said. \"even i can count that far .\" now they can joke about it. the phillies beat the mets, 4-0, in the process of snapping a scoreless stretch at citi field. new york helped the cause with three errors that led to three unearned runs. and on the day chase utley began his rehab 1,000 miles south, the phils moved back to within two games of the first-place atlanta braves. on saturday, halladay played the familiar role of stopper as the importance of a single game increases. that's an unusual feeling for halladay. he's pitching in a pennant race for the first time since his rookie season. \"it's going to be fun,\" halladay said. \"this is obviously the biggest reason i wanted to play here .\" in addition to notching the team's first hit of the night - as well as the game's first run - halladay pitched eight shutout innings. his season era is 2.24, third-best in the majors behind only <mark>adam wainwright</mark> and tim hudson. the hit elicited a smile from manuel and some dugout chatter, the manager said. halladay might be on the most modest five-game hitting streak ever. \"he finally hit the grass tonight, didn't he?\" manuel quipped. \"i haven't gotten too many out of the infield,\" halladay said. \"i'll take it .\" on the mound, halladay was dominant. immediately after he plated the first run, halladay surrendered a leadoff triple to <mark>jose reyes</mark>. he never advanced. angel pagan hit a 93 m.p.h. fastball weakly to third for the first out. <mark>david wright</mark> whiffed on a dastardly curveball for strike three. on the sixth pitch to the next hitter, <mark>carlos beltran</mark>, halladay threw the same knee-bending curve. it elicited the same response: <mark>beltran</mark> swung and missed. \"my command was better,\" halladay said. \"i didn't have as many balls over the plate .\" the one run was enough for halladay, but he had breathing room courtesy of new york's sloppy defense. in the fifth, raul ibanez hit a grounder to second that could have been a double play. but ruben tejada threw wildly to second, which allowed <mark>jimmy rollins</mark> to score. in the sixth, <mark>wright</mark> let a slow grounder go between his legs. instead of the inning ending, two more phillies runs scored and the boos rained down on <mark>wright</mark>. \"i don't think you're going to win too many games making three errors,\" <mark>wright</mark> said. \"when you have [halladay] on the mound, you know you're going to have to play pretty perfect baseball to beat him and we were far from that tonight .\" manuel denied halladay the chance for his ninth complete game of the season, which would have tied his total from all of 2009. having thrown 113 pitches in eight innings and the phillies comfortably holding a four-run lead, the manager decided his ace had done enough. manuel said he is monitoring halladay, who leads the majors in innings, more closely than before. halladay, for his part, said he is ready for a heavy workload down the stretch. \"today and the last couple of times i felt strong,\" he said. \"it's just a matter of maintaining that. the closer you get to the end of the season and you're in it, you get a little boost .\" after the game, manuel, relaxed by halladay's standard performance, sat back in his office chair in a jovial mood. his team is coming together at the right moment. when asked a question about ryan madson's shaky ninth inning, manuel began to answer. then he stopped. \"don't forget,\" he said, \"utley had a triple .\" confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to report

2019 22:02 pm The one sporting event in British sporting culture that epitomises the\" choke' (other than the England Men's Cricket Team (1877 - present), the English men's football team (1872-1966, 1966 - present), England - well, you get the idea) is of course Devon Loch. Miles ahead in the most prestigious race of the year, with nothing to do but amble to the finish line, this noble horse took the ultimate revenge on the sadistic sod that had made him do all that jumping and inexplicably belly-flopped barely forty yards from the line. Lanterne Rouge aficionados will note that Deven Loch failed to actually finish the race and thus what was otherwise a brilliant display of snatching immortality from a winning position will be forever tainted. The reason for bringing this up is because French hope Yoyo Offredo is currently mid-air and about to crash land in the most publicly embarrassing way possible, and the French public, to continue the metaphor, are about to smash the bottle of Dubonnet firmly over the head of the nearest footman. Anyone suggesting the Queen Mum really reacted by saying \"That's racing\" are perpetuating a conspiracy around the death of Mr A Scroggins, Royal Footman, mysteriously found dead by Dubonnet overdose in the Royal Box. I will now demonstrate the Masonic numbers attached to this-Hang on, I'm literally being buzzed by military helicopters at this point and hadn't even posted it. I'm not ordinarily a tin-foil-hatter, but this is a bit spooky...Anyway, after another brilliant ride by Langeveld it looks like Offredo is about to dash French hopes and surrender the most prestigious title in cycling. The reasons for this urgent collapse in form are totally opaque, but it seems the decision of the commissaires to protect him from <mark>Tony Martin</mark> has not been enough. The slight time Offredo took back from Langeveld yesterday appears to have been a dead cat bounce, or in cycling terms \"Cofidis rider making the break on stage 20\". Offredo remains LR by just three seconds, and surely this will disappear in the next couple of stages - although we've been saying something similar at the wrong end of the race about the man my predictive text is currently calling Julie-Ann's Fillip. The drama in the competition for the LR has overshadowed a brilliant ride from fourth-vowel-abolitionist Michael Mrkv, who soloed to a huge six minute gap over everyone else on today's stage. With the TV cameras inexplicably focused on the travails of Tommy 2.0 (eg AKA Phillip), capturing this immense ride was left to our very own Chief Livestock Correspondent, ATC, who cleverly applied some sort of filter to imply progress was being made. In true LR fashion I note she filed her copy late but just about within the cutoff. Superb work. Elsewhere De Busker is surely out of it, no matter how many Ed Sheeran numbers he butchers, though Mrkv's ride means the final podium spot is very much a live question, Lar \"Sytting <mark>Bak</mark>\" <mark>Bak</mark> is showing the benefit of experience, moving smoothly up to a decent position, Rich Cheeze appears to have panicked about someone playing Beck's Odelay and finished far too quickly. He'll learn, I'm sure, but it takes him back out of the top ten White feather to ATC, whose photographic evidence suggests started up the Galibier well before the field yet got overtaken by the whole bally lot of them. Excellent stuff.

arriving in the daytime. the charles widmore who is sitting by his hospital bed. widmore tells <mark>locke</mark> that he had a specialist flown in to do a better job of setting the leg. widmore relates how he was 17 when he first met <mark>locke</mark> on the island. intrigued by the fact that <mark>locke</mark> looks no different now then when they originally met over 50 years ago (for widmore), he asks <mark>locke</mark> how long it has been since richard. <mark>locke</mark> replies that it has only been four days. <mark>locke</mark> confirms that the camera in the desert is widmore's, asking how widmore knew the he would be there. widmore replies \"that's matthew abaddon. widmore assumes aloud that <mark>locke</mark> was exiled by ben as well, but <mark>locke</mark> corrects him, saying that he left voluntarily, to bring his friends back to the island. <mark>locke</mark> mentions that ben left the island before he did. <mark>locke</mark> questions why widmore should want <mark>locke</mark> and the others back on the island. widmore says that there is a war coming and if <mark>locke</mark> is not back, the\" wrong side \"is going to win. later, during the daytime, widmore and <mark>locke</mark> sit outside the hospital and widmore tells <mark>locke</mark> that he will help him find the oceanic six. widmore gives him dossiers on their locations, as he has been keeping an extensive eye on them. he also offers matthew abaddon as a driver and introduces him to <mark>locke</mark>. sayid is seen helping to construct a school as part of a charity called build our world. <mark>locke</mark> approaches him and speaks with him, but sayid refuses to return. he explains that nadia, with whom he spent nine months, before her death. sayid questions if the only reason that <mark>locke</mark> wants to return to the island is because he has nowhere else to go. before leaving, <mark>locke</mark> tells sayid that he can be contacted under the name <mark>locke</mark> after three years of separation. abaddon stop opposite a school in uptown new york. while waiting, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to locate helen norwood for him. abaddon asks if she is an old girlfriend, a question to which <mark>locke</mark> doesn't reply. as the school bell rings, <mark>locke</mark> asks abaddon to help him out of the car. a group of students leaves the school, and amongst them is? <mark>locke</mark> waves to walt, who promptly leaves his friends and crosses the street to talk to <mark>locke</mark>. <mark>locke</mark> asks why walt isn't surprised to see him, and walt explains that he'd been having dreams of <mark>locke</mark> in a suit on the island, surrounded by people who wanted to hurt him. <mark>locke</mark> says that it is good that they are just dreams, to which walt gives him a nervous and confused look. walt also asks about his father, whom he suspects of returning to the island after dropping out of contact for three years. <mark>locke</mark> says that the last he had heard of hurley in his wheelchair, hurley is seen drawing a picture of an egyptian sphinx. hurley, completely nonchalant, asks <mark>locke</mark> why he is in a wheelchair, to which <mark>locke</mark> replies that he fell down a hole. hurley asks him if this is how he died, assuming <mark>locke</mark> is dead as he has been having regular conversations with dead people. however, hurley asks a nurse if he is talking to a man in a wheelchair, and she confirms it, letting hurley believe <mark>locke</mark> is alive. he asks him how he got off the island, and <mark>locke</mark> attempts to persuade hurley to return to the island. the attempt fails when hurley sees matthew abaddon and panics, refusing to have any more to do with either of them, insisting that\" that guy is evil. \"hurley recounts how abaddon posed as an employee of oceanic airlines at santa rosa hospital. the island. <mark>locke</mark> is at kate's house, who refuses to return in spite of the consequences to those still on the island. kate tells <mark>locke</mark> that she believes the only reason he wanted to stay on the island was because he didn't love anybody. he disagrees, and talks about his relationship with helen which, didn't work out because he was\" angry and obsessed. \"kate sarcastically replies\" look how far you've come. \"ben. <mark>locke</mark> and abaddon are in a cemetery, before a stone memorializing? abaddon states that she died of a brain aneurysm. <mark>john</mark> laments that helen loved him and if he had stayed, they would have been together. abaddon states that it wouldn't change anything, she'd still be dead, but <mark>locke</mark> seems unconvinced. abaddon reasons that helen is where she is supposed to be and that <mark>locke</mark> is destined to end up on the island. <mark>locke</mark> questions whether he believes that everything is predetermined and that he doesn't have a choice; abaddon asks whether richard alpert's prediction that <mark>locke</mark> must die is predetermined or whether it's a choice. <mark>locke</mark>, confused, wonders aloud how it could possibly be his choice to die. as abaddon is loading <mark>john</mark>'s wheelchair into the car's trunk, he is shot three times by an unseen <mark>locke</mark>. he wakes up in a hospital bed, with a disheveled ben. as he helps <mark>locke</mark> down, ben tells <mark>locke</mark> he has too much work to do to die and suggests contacting sun. <mark>locke</mark> says he promised jin he wouldn't contact her, and shows ben the wedding ring jin gave him. ben is surprised that jin is alive. <mark>locke</mark> states that he knows what he must do next - he must contact a woman who lives in los angeles named daniel's map. daniel's map has mysteriously been augmented to include ilana then comes in and asks him if he's found anything, and he says no. when she presses him, he takes a flashlight out of the sack and tosses it to her, not mentioning the gun. she tells him that there is a man on the beach in a suit who was not on the plane. on the way back to the gravel path, the plane sits on the path at an angle, but is intact. when they arrive to the camp, they meet a following day, <mark>locke</mark> stands at the edge of the surf, gazing toward the main island. christian shephard's shoes lie on the sand nearby. ilana walks up to <mark>locke</mark> and introduces herself, and offers him a mango, which he muses may be the best mango he has ever tasted. <mark>locke</mark> inquires about two outrigger canoes which sit nearby on the shore. ilana says that the canoes were already there, and that there had been a third one, but ben as the man who killed him. later, <mark>locke</mark> visits caesar in the office in dharma initiative, whose logo appears on the document caesar is reading. caesar questions <mark>locke</mark>'s knowledge of this, and <mark>locke</mark> replies that he has been on the island before, for over 100 days. caesar, confused but curious, asks <mark>locke</mark> if he can explain what he witnessed on the plane, describing how he was sitting next to a heavyset man with curly hair who disappeared during the flash of light, and that other survivors of the crash also reported seeing passengers disappear. realizing from his description that caesar is talking about hurley, <mark>locke</mark> responds that he now has a better idea of how he came to be on the island. the people who disappeared are accounted for. caesar says that they are, other than those who were injured in the crash. he leads <mark>locke</mark> to a makeshift infirmary where the injured passengers are resting. <mark>locke</mark> moves between them, closely looking at each person. he seems

<mark>john locke</mark> told him that he was off the island. similarly, walt appeared to know <mark>locke</mark>'s alias of jeremy bentham. this is possibly a blooper/continuity error or a suggestion that <mark>locke</mark> may have visited them both a second time not shown in this episode. apart from the reused footage of <mark>locke</mark> turning the frozen wheel, this entire episode takes place off the island. the only real-time events take place on hydra island, while the rest is a flashback. abaddon's license plate is szu 766. this is not (as some have conjectured) a reference to sun tzu. rather, it is the same stock license plate used by marlon brando in the film don juan demarco. when <mark>john</mark> visits hurley in the santa rosa mental health institute, he is wearing a name
