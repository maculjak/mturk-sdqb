\"i'm not sure. i think my mentality is that you're never going to play a perfect game. so even though you might play very well, you're always going to think about the one or two things you could do differently to affect the outcome of the game. that would be my perspective .\" were you a little disappointed that even though you racked up over 500 yards on sunday, you managed only 23 points? \"yes. i was actually happy that we got a win on the road in a tough environment that you look at statistically in terms of that no nfc south team had ever gone in there and won. we over the last few years can point to a few games that might be similar to that. that was a team that plays very well at home. that was a team that defensively had played very well this season even though the stats in the jets game might not point to it because they were put in some bad positions, but to put up 500 yards of total offense you shake your head because you look at the scoreboard and that should show up some more. obviously you look and say why is that? we got down inside the 20 three times and just came away with field goals and not touchdowns. that certainly could have helped. we had a big play or two and it could have gotten us more points. i was, being the personality i am, i'm happy for us as a team to come out of the game healthy, get a big win and keep the streak going, but i'm also upset at myself for some things and feeling like we still have to improve at some things .\" are you impressed at how <mark>cam newton</mark> has done given the lack of an offseason? \"yes. i haven't seen any film on him. the only thing i saw was when they played jacksonville before us. it (conditions) were really sloppy, so it was hard to get a gauge for the guy. you look at the sheer statistics and shake your head. i don't care how long you've been in this league. it's hard to put up the numbers he's put up. he's certainly a raw talent. we all knew that, but i don't know if anybody could predict it, so you certainly have to give him credit for what he's been able to accomplish so far .\" how would you compare and contrast the defensive styles of <mark>john fox</mark> and <mark>ron rivera</mark>? \"they're (panthers) doing some different things. some stuff you see a little bit of the philly carryover with <mark>sean mcdermott</mark> and his experience there. <mark>ron rivera</mark> being in a 4-3 scheme up in chicago when he was the defensive coordinator there in '06 when we played him and then he went on to be the d-coordinator in san diego where they run the 3-4 and obviously now he's in carolina where they do the 4-3, yet they do some stuff in the nickel that looks like there's some 3-4 ideas. i think it's a mixture of a little bit of everything. i know they had two big injuries in (jon) beason and <mark>thomas davis</mark> but i have a lot of respect for that defense. i lot of those guys have been together for a while. i know they're pretty young up front. the secondary and those guys have been together for a while and i think it shows .\" <mark>cam newton</mark> says he's a big fan of yours and would love to learn how you run an offense. how would you size him up and what words of wisdom would you give? \"how would i size him up? he towers over me. maybe some words of wisdom after the game. i think there's always a competitive thing between quarterbacks when you're playing against each other even though i'm not directly facing <mark>cam newton</mark> and he's not directly facing me. he's facing our defense and i'm facing his defense. it's hard to go into any game against a talented young player or seasoned veteran that you know has a lot of talent and you have a lot of respect for and has a little bit of extra oomph and your kind of going step for step. but, in the end, i'm focused on scoring as many points as i can, hopefully that's more than they score, but he's obviously in our division. we're going to be seeing a lot of this guy .\" when he came to san diego? did you wonder what type of role he would have at his size? \"we drafted him in' 05. he walks in the door and you think gosh this guy is tiny by nfl standards in terms of a running back. he had accomplished some great things in college. he was coming into a situation where we had ladanian tomlinson and <mark>michael turner</mark>, so really he was just fulfilling that special teams role the first year. then from afar, i'm watching him because i liked him and wanted him to succeed. i'm watching his role increase and increase. he really was doing some great things in san diego by the time he entered his fourth, fifth, sixth season and that was a big reason why this offseason, training with him and watching the way he works, he's a pro. he does anything you ask. when it came time to go back to camp, i said to <mark>sean</mark> (payton\" , \"you might want to go after this guy .' .\" was this the first offseason you and todd durkin worked with sproles? \"yes .\" what was his mentality? \"he's a quiet guy, competitive though. there are guys like that. (is) competitive but quiet. devery (henderson), (robert) meachem, you don't hear a lot from those guys vocally, but deep down there's a fire inside that burns. sproles has got unbelievable spirit and that competitive fire. you can see little things. i think that's why he's so good with a lot of things. if you find a thing he hasn't mastered yet or quite worked on, he's going to find a way to get better at it. i see it when there's a big play to be made and he doesn't make it. it's on to the next play too. he's not one to dwell. i really like him. it's hard because my perspective that first year in san diego, him looking at ladanian tomlinson who's in the prime of his career, <mark>michael turner</mark> who i believe was in his second year, but we know what kind of player he's become, so i'm sure sprolesie was thinking he was going to watch these guys, learn how to be a pro, learn how to get it done and contribute. did i think sproles would be the player he now is when he first came in? i don't know. he's just a rare talent, not just physically, but his mental makeup. i think it takes a really tough person, physically, mentally, at his size to do what he's done .\" how often were you making casual references to him to join the saints? \"just when we trained. i didn't know what was going to happen with reggie (bush). i told him if reggie's not here, you're going to be here .\" maybe in san diego he didn't have that many snaps, but what's been the difference here? \"i'm not sure. you'd have to ask him .\" is it a situation where he's used more? \"san diego played a few primetime games. i'm a fan so i watch those. it seems like his name was always coming up. always, whether it was a catch out of the backfield for a 50-yard touchdown, a punt return, his name was always getting thrown around. he was making plays. i never really counted the snaps, but i think here, maybe what's so great about his role here is the fact with our three backs in pierre (<mark>thomas</mark>), mark (ingram) and sproles, each one of them has a role and yet you can plug them all in at any place. i feel very confident about all their skill sets. i think when you take his contributions in all phases? i think he has a hand in everything. he knows his number will get called and he'll have opportunities. i have to give a lot of credit to <mark>sean</mark>, because <mark>sean</mark> has a knack for everything. every guy has their plays, their opportunities. they're in the plan. they're going to get (their number) called. that keeps guys excited and focused, knowing that my number's going to get called and i have to get ready .\" why have you guys had trouble against carolina in the past? \"they're a tough team. i think they play us tough. this is no excuse, two times we played them in the last game of the season when we were resting starters, still if you were looking at it, it's even and i believe in that case it's 4-4. we've traded punches many times, had some close games .\" have other division games been like that? \"yes, you could say the same thing for atlanta. those have been close. tampa, the last two years has been weird. we've gone to their place the last two years and dominated and they've come to ours and beaten us. what the heck? it's divisional opponents, where you know each other well. you know each other's personnel. you really try to beat each other up each time you play. anything can happen can you talk about the importance of your third down conversion percentage?\" third down conversions are big, because those sustained drives, you wear a defense down, the more points you score, at least the more opportunities you will have to score points, the longer you can rest your defense, so they can come out there and give you the ball right back. that's a big stat. turnover ratio is a big stat. red zone efficiency is a big stat. those are a couple that i pay attention to. \"what is your explanation for what you think is a league trend for how much yardage and scoring is occuring?\" i don't know. who knows? we're only four games into the season. i'd like to think that trend's going to continue for us with the yardage, points and everything else. it's hard to put your finger on it because we were all in the same boat this season, offenses and defenses. there's always the argument about what side of the ball needs the most time to execute. you could say offensively if one guy messes up it could mess up a whole play, you could probably say the same for defense. so much of what you do defensively is just reacting, whereas on offense your interacting. i don't know. i'm just kind of talking. i don't know. what do you think of currently having six quarterbacks on pace to beat dan marino's single season yardage record that you came close to breaking three years ago? \"that's unusual. the rules i would say. even though there weren't any rules changes this offseason that i can think of that with the exception of even more emphasis of protecting players down the field with hits. guys aren't worried about catching balls and having their head taken off because of penalties and a fine. guys have more of a chance to catch it because they're hit in the body rather than the head. but other than that, they're protecting the quarterbacks the same as they always have in the pocket. you get out, throw the ball away, not go past the line of scrimmage. all those rules are the same. why this year instead of last year? everybody's searching for the answers. a lot want to blame it on the lockout. i just think there are some good quarterbacks and skill position players in this league. you see what <mark>calvin johnson</mark>'s doing. there's some freak athletes out there. did anybody expect <mark>cam newton</mark> to be doing what he's doing? it's hard to believe. buffalo putting up the points and numbers they're putting up, (ryan) fitzpatrick. there are tons of guys that are playing at a high level around the league. it's fun to watch. for a guy like me who's involved in it. it's still fun to watch. i keep up with it .\" what did you think of the mercedes-benz announcement?", "articleID": "2011100813_00082385_W", "names": {"Cam Newton": ["Q5024850", "Q5024852", "Q591678"], "John Fox": ["Q12892062", "Q13459838", "Q19662010", "Q19750869", "Q24285717", "Q3809274", "Q44786513", "Q6233800", "Q6233806", "Q6233808", "Q6233810", "Q719030"], "Michael Turner": ["Q1372347", "Q1372443", "Q15969753", "Q1929622", "Q2083939", "Q20853582", "Q43210688", "Q562007", "Q6834989", "Q6834993", "Q6834994", "Q6834995"], "Ron Rivera": ["Q1991889", "Q7364319"], "Sean Mcdermott": ["Q7441226", "Q7441228", "Q7441229"], "Thomas Davis": ["Q17721764", "Q28972061", "Q3525031", "Q48841038", "Q7788881"]}}, {"date": "2011-10-09", "url": "http://khon2.com/entertainment/story/Gaga-wants-career-before-motherhood/4bAVmMzgbESG7_Ad5b-Hgw.cspx", "content": "lady gaga arrives at nevermind nightclub on july 11, 2011 in sydney, australia.

pittsburgh post-gazette penn state running back joe suhey, right, leaps into the arms of tight end kevin haplea after haplea scored a touchdown, the only one of the game, against iowa in the fourth quarter saturday at beaver stadium. university park, pa .--gerald hodges arrived at penn state as a hard-hitting safety in 2009. he was moved to linebacker three games into his freshman year and has been there ever since. hodges, the nittany lions' starting weakside linebacker, helped launch an all-out blitz saturday against iowa's passing attack at beaver stadium. penn state was clinging to a 6-3 lead early in the fourth quarter when hodges made a game-changing play. he blitzed up the middle on a third-and-7 call from the 45 and sacked iowa quarterback james vandenberg for a 7-yard loss and forced the first fumble of his career, which strongside linebacker nate stupar recovered at the iowa 49. eleven plays later, quarterback matt mcgloin cashed in on the turnover, hitting backup tight end kevin haplea with a 2-yard touchdown pass to seal the 13-3 victory against the hawkeyes. \"[defensive coordinator tom] bradley was blitzing like crazy,\" hodges said. \"every play was a blitz and we were loving it. every time we got to blitz, we were smiling .\" it was another chance for us to make a good play. \"hodges sprinted off the field after the play and jumped high in the air to chest-bump with graduate assistant elijah robinson .\" he always talks to me about my pass-rushing; he always works with me on my pass-rushing, \"hodges said .\" so, he gave me a chance [saturday], and once i finally got [the sack], he come out there and gave me a big hit. \"the sack by hodges was one of a season-high five registered by the penn state defense, which is expected to get injured cornerback d'anton lynn (concussion) back this week. linebacker khairi fortt had 1 1/2 sacks, defensive tackle devon still and defensive end <mark>sean</mark> stanley each had one and defensive end eric latimore was credited with half a sack. strong safety drew astorino said hodges, a junior, played a big role in the victory .\" he did an unbelievable job, \"astorino said .\" we sent him on a lot of weakside blitzes and he got to the quarterback. he did his job and put pressure on the quarterback. \"he was huge for us .\" penn state (5-1, 2-0 big ten), which returned to the usa today coaches poll sunday at no. 25, will welcome purdue (3-2, 1-0) to beaver stadium saturday for homecoming. hodges, 6 feet 2 and 234 pounds, leads the lions defense with 36 tackles. he also has 3 1/2 tackles for loss and is tied with still and stanley for the team lead with two sacks. \"gerald's just a heck of an athlete,\" still said. \"he's all over the field. the defensive linemen are able to take more chances because we've got guys like him back there that can make up for it .\" hodges, from paulsboro, n.j., has suffered some minor bumps and bruises this year, ranging from a sprained ankle to an injured elbow. a year ago, he sustained a hairline fracture of his left leg on the opening kickoff in the second game at alabama and missed the next four games. he returned oct. 23 against minnesota and finished with 31 tackles. he played in every game as a freshman, mostly on special teams. \"i feel as though i came back better and stronger this year and even more mentally stronger [from the leg injury],\" hodges said. \"it was frustrating, but i feel like some good came out of it, too .\" hodges eventually would like to play strongside linebacker, following the same path that was paved by former penn state standouts <mark>sean lee</mark> and navorro bowman on their way to the nfl. \"i look at those guys and i'm like .\" these guys did it. i can do it,' \"hodges said .\" i just try to take what i can do and put it with the technical part and the instinct part, put them together, and just try to play football. \"at the same time, the position i am, it's kind of hard to do that. my time will come. i just keep praying, keep my mind clear and my frustration down and when you're playing, you want to get involved .\" we've got a good defense--you want to be a big part of

new, and different results. they have to do something to get this team excited, and orton just isn't cutting it as team leader. hey, when they have a chance to win, and the offense goes three-and-out on three plays that weren't even close, that hurts morale. it's hard to have confidence in a guy who goes 6-13 for 34 yards with one interception, and is tied for the league lead in interceptions. i do not put all of the onus on orton, but it is the job of the qb to be the team leader, to be the spark in offensive engine, and to rally the troops when it's rally time. orton may be the best qb they have, and their best option under center in terms of talent, ability, and experience, but, when it comes to motivating a team, and getting them to believe they can win, orton isn't cutting it and has lost the confidence not only of the fans, but of his teammates as well. orton won the job in training camp, and pretty much came out and stunk up the place on the way to a 1-4 record at the bye. watching <mark>jay cutler</mark> on monday night, and realizing that his offensive line was as bad or worse than the broncos, and also realizing that he was finding ways to overcome that when orton could not even come close really sealed the deal for me. orton gives up too easily, and resigns himself to, \"there's nothing i can do,\" but tebow, no matter how much he still has yet to learn will take whatever you give him, and keep trying no matter what. i truly can't believe it. the fans in denver really do run the football team. how else do you explain a 3rd string qb jumping to starter with no injuries involve? orton and quinn should both be asking for trades. of course, if i ran the team i would trade all 3. i could care less about entertainment. i want the team to win. that is the point of this sport. okay, please tell us what trades you would make, which qarterback out there you could aquire and how you would teach him the offense fast enough that he would have a better chance of winning the current qb. with the records of the past coaching staffs, the fans can do just a good a job...rathbone7 wrote: i truly can't believe it. the fans in denver really do run the football

or have much invested in our broncos, so you can leave whenever you'd like. second, it was obviously clear that tebow in no way was ever \"3rd string\" , like many on these boards tried to claim (scott silver also said he was 4th string???? yeah good call silver). <mark>fox</mark> came out and literally said anyone who thought he was 3rd string was just flat out wrong. <mark>fox</mark> hasnt really handled this teams affairs all that well.he seems to be a day late and a dollar short all the time. i give him bringing miller in...but thats it. where is this high powered running game/sure mcaghee is running his off. . but i doubt hell last the season this way. moreno has become a reciever. wheres ball in all this? seldom seen. he played ortons card till he literly had to pull the guy from embarassment. trying to prove some damn thing??? for being known as a great defensive coach...im not seeing it. it looks to me like, these guys are trying but they are doing it on fumes...from other organaizations and their own knowledge. wheres is the <mark>john fox</mark> stamp on this defense? im a little mcd!!! again!!! he does chew gum rather well...with an open mouth...nice...i will admit i supported mcdaniels and orton more than both deserve. with the lockout, coaching change and a pretty bare bones football team i can't really blame coach <mark>fox</mark> for the current teams lackluster play. as fans we know of the major problems the broncos have been going through and most would agree we need a franchise qb to start, but we also know how pathetic the defense was and how porous our o-line and terrible running game has been. orton earned the opportunity to be the starting quarterback, he simply couldn't produce with it. therefore, <mark>fox</mark> has to make this change and that change has to be tebow. when you have an \"o'\" line that can't block and receivers who can't get open, a quarterback that can run is your only options. broncocrusader wrote: mr mojo

themselves anyone who \"gave orton more credit that he deserved\" especially after his last two seasons should have their nfl viewing rights stripped. face it, your ttds prevented you from seeing what was right in front of you. irrational hate can do that to ya. you wanted orton to be good, in the face of his recent history, because it would have justified your hate of tt. how'd that delusion work out for ya? there are no \"tebow\" fans, as much as you and the few remaining ttdsers would like to believe. the fact that you can't name names or point to posts tells you that. the reality is we are bronco fans who thought the best interest of the franchise was in finding out what tebow can do on the football field for a whole season before throwing away 3 drafts on another qb. but again, ttds prevented you from seeing the reality of the situation. even now you can't admit you were wrong, and only grudgingly give \"tebow fans\" credit. does the fact that i joined this board in 2009, while tt was still in college, mean anything to you, or does your ttds require you to just dismiss facts if they don't fit your delusion? johnnyk7 wrote: ok, so tebow had to shake off a little rust in the third quarter. no problem, it s/b expected. a few bobbled exchanges under center are ok. we want him in there to learn and give us the entertainment of days gone past. i remember elway doing the same thing when he was first starting out. shucks, on occaision, <mark>john</mark> used to line up under the guard instead of the center. the way i see it, three or four passes should have been caught by our receivers (even though they were a little under thrown). 95% of the time, if it hits them in two hands, it should be caught. end of story. boy-oh-boy, i especially wish decker wouldve caught his. even more so, i wish that he had one more step when he stormed in towards the right side of the endzone on the last play of the game and ultimately redeemed himself by catching the winning touchdown. decker & tebow have a pretty good chance to become a thing of legends just like elway & sharpe, or elway & smith, or elway and mccaffery. tim has all of the intangibles. tim is a student of the game. i do not know about you all, but i can see the difference already in regards to tebow staying in the pocket and looking for the receivers first before taking off. he showed it in the pre-season and he showed it on sunday. he is the kind of person that will not let himself fail. here's what i'd like to see happen. we finally trade orton to miami in the next two weeks. he starts for miami agianst us, against tebow, and von miller is unleashed on him hmmmm, it could happen. wishful thinking! hey, by the way, when rivers fumbled the ball and we got it overturned by the refs, would you not enforce the kenny stabler rule (wink) \"he gave us a spark. that's tim tebow,\" running back willis mcgahee said afterward. \"everybody's been cheering for him for the longest, and now he finally got in and came in and moved the ball for us .\" careful there willis, that almost sounds like the locker room was pulling for tebow from the start. of course willis is a miami product and should be a big supporter of tebow. i also think kuper is in that category. why it seemed as if the whole team played harder after tebow came in as qb. who could possibly imaging such a metamorphosis. well maybe some of those stupid fans. you know the one's that aren't the coaches. the one's who should just sit back and shut up, because the coaches are the professionals, and.... yada,...yada,...yada

lessons. 1. i gave orton more credit than he deserved. 2. that there are quite a few tebow fans that have more football knowledge than i gave them credit. 3. a minion will always be a minion and have no rational thoughts to convey and should keep their thought to themselves i can't tell if this is a serious comment or if you're being sarcastic. i hope that you do truly realize that some tebow fans do know football. i hope you give credit to people who, from day one, said this is what would happen. also, i don't know what your minion comment is about. i think the previous posters comment has validity to it. no matter what tim does in the coming weeks, there will be people (yourself included most likely) that will still scrutinize his faults. he could win the game with 300 + yards and 3 tds but they will find his 10 incompletions and say how they were way off target or terrible decisions. \"man, the broncos just can't catch a break at dt. before too long, they may have to make a
