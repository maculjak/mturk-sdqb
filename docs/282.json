Earlier this month, the Obama Administration said it supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy on gay and transgender minors. \"The end goal of this conference is that our leaders and experts will be well informed and able to provide proper care to LGBT Jews,\" Mordechai Levovitz, a conference co-chair, told me. A gay, Orthodox man, Levovitz is also the founder and director of JQY, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing crisis and support resources for at-risk LGBT youth in the Orthodox & Hasidic community. Levovitz explained that the conference is a way for the orthodox rabbinical community and the therapeutic community to work together. \"Therapists can't provide care if they don't understand the orthodox community and rabbis can't provide proper guidance if they don't understand the psychological issues at hand,\" he said. \"This conference isn't about advocacy but rather it's an opportunity for learning and dialogue.\" \"The question that this conference is asking isn't whether you can be both gay and Orthodox, because that is a very judgmental question. The question is: How can we provide responsible support for LGBT people in the orthodox community?\" In an interview, Levovitz explained that this question challenges the Jewish leaders in power as opposed to victims in the community. According to Levovitz, JQY influenced the Rabbinical Council of America's 2012 decision to rescind their recommendation of JONAH - the largest Jewish conversion therapy organization. Sean Herzfeld, a 15-year-old JQY member who recently came out to his Orthodox high school, was quoted in a press release as saying that \"It's not enough to simply tell LGBT teens in religious communities that it gets better later. We have to work within the community to make it better now.\" The Keynote speakers at the conference will be RCA Honorary President Rabbi Shmuel Goldin and RCA Executive Vice President Rabbi Mark Dratch. They will joined by mental health professionals including Dr. Jack Drescher and Dr. Mark Blechner, Editor in Chief Emeritus of the journal Contemporary Psychoanalysis, and Dr Alison Feit, Executive Director of The Jewish Center for Trauma and Recovery. JQY will hold the conference at the Kraft Center in New York together with the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology.

beatlemania is set to break out again this week when the beatles' digitally remastered albums and a new computer game are released as the world's most famous pop group finally embraces the digital age. the legendary british quartet's entire back catalogue has been remastered and cleaned up, while the fab four appear in the beatles: rock band, which is tipped to become one of the world's biggest selling games. the beatles' company apple corps has historically shunned releasing their music in digital formats due to piracy concerns. but rock band players will be able to download entire albums in the coming months as the 1960s icons catch up with 21st century technology. the beatles' back catalogue was first released on compact disc in 1987, though many fans felt the sound quality did not match the original vinyl, while technological advances since then have highlighted flaws and imperfections. the new versions, to be released on wednesday, include the group's 12 albums, plus the magical mystery tour soundtrack and the past masters releases covering non-album singles. some are tipping them to dominate the charts around the globe. two box sets are also being released: one in stereo and the other in mono. the albums are those released in britain, and retain the original artwork and track listings. it is the first time that the group's first four albums - please please me, with the beatles, a hard day's night and beatles for sale - have been released on compact disc entirely in stereo. the albums were digitally remastered over a four-year period at abbey road studios in london, where the beatles - lead guitarist <mark>george harrison</mark>, rhythm guitarist <mark>john lennon</mark>, bassist paul mccartney and drummer ringo starr - recorded most of their music. the remasters were done \"utilising state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings,\" apple corps and record label emi said. \"the result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the catalogue has seen since its original release.\" it was agreed that electrical clicks, microphone vocal pops, excessive sibilance and bad edits should be improved where possible, so long as it didn't impact on the original integrity of the songs, \"they said. de-noising technology was only used for less than five of the beatles' 525 minutes of music. to mark the revival, the bbc is running a beatles week, with programmes examining the band in the studio, their first visit to the united states, their impact in the former soviet union and the beatlemania phenomenon. the broadcasts feature previously unreleased out-takes and studio chat. meanwhile the fab four have been recreated in virtual forms in the beatles: rock band, a game that lets players join the band as they springboard from gigs in their native liverpool, northwest england, to global stardom. players strum away at plastic replicas of guitars played by <mark>lennon</mark>, harrison and mccartney, keep the beat on a version of starr's drum kit, or try out beatles harmonies. forty-five songs are included with the videogame, and more of the bands' tunes will be sold as digital downloads from the internet. the abbey road album will be released in october, followed by sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band in november and rubber soul in december. the videogame will be available for play on the three major consoles: microsoft's xbox 360, sony's playstation 3, and nintendo's wii. a 30-second clip has been produced to promote the game, using archive footage, actors and computer trickery to bring the famous\" abbey road \"cover to life.\" the project is a fun idea which broadens the appeal of the beatles and their music, \"mccartney said. the concept for the videogame was honed with input from mccartney and starr as well as from beatles widows <mark>yoko ono</mark> and olivia harrison.\" how wonderful that the beatles' legacy will find its natural progression into the 21st century through the computerised world we live in, \"starr said.\" the game is good, the graphics are very good -

The lockup is about 7 miles (11 kilometers) northeast of Penn State's main campus. Schultz and Curley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment in March, leading prosecutors to drop three felony charges of child endangerment and conspiracy. Curley, 63, must serve three months in jail, while Schultz, 67, has two months behind bars. Jail officials said they will be evaluated for participation in work release while incarcerated. A co-defendant, former Penn State president Graham Spanier, 68, was convicted of the same offense and faces two months in jail. Spanier remains free on bail while he appeals to Superior Court. Spanier continues to be a tenured faculty member and is on administrative leave. A deal with the university when he was forced out as president after Sandusky's arrest in November 2011 pays him $600,000 a year, ending this fall, after which he will receive a salary. The three men received a complaint from a graduate assistant football coach in February 2001 who said he was highly disturbed by seeing Sandusky appear to sexually abuse the boy late on a Friday night in a team shower. They told Sandusky not to bring children onto campus anymore, but prosecutors said the administrators had no plan to enforce that rule. Police were not notified, and a criminal investigation into Sandusky did not begin until a Pennsylvania school district reported another complaint about him in 2008. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of child sexual abuse. He maintains his innocence and is appealing, while serving 30 to 60 years in state prison. The scandal led the university to fire Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno, who was informed of the 2001 incident the next morning by the assistant, Mike McQueary. Paterno notified Curley but did not call police. He died in 2012, a few months after his firing, and was never charged with a crime. An anonymous email in 2010 led investigators looking into Sandusky to contact McQueary, and he proved to be a critical witness at the criminal trials of both Sandusky and Spanier.

At sentencing for Curley, Schultz and Spanier last month, Judge John Boccabella did not spare Paterno, saying he \"could have made that phone call without so much as getting his hands dirty. Why he didn't is beyond me.\" He also questioned Curley's memory lapses while testifying for the prosecution at Spanier's trial. \"I find it really hard to believe that he doesn't remember every detail of the most serious mistake he ever made,\" Boccabella said .------Associated Press writer Mark Scolforo contributed from Harrisburg.
