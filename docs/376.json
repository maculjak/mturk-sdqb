Hodges is an inmate at the Madison County Penal Farm, and Dickerson expects he'll be released in August after serving a year sentence. \"Talking to him, he's more enthused.

But for Owatonna's Amanda Haskell, those medals and plaques are mile markers of a life back on track. They're tangible evidence of promises finally fulfilled after a detour of drugs and depression, and signs heralding a future of boundless possibility. \"I don't want to be afraid to tell my story,\" she said. \"Finally becoming who I was before has been an incredible journey .\" And, she added, the MAAP STARS awards \"showed I can achieve something .\" As a child, Haskell was so bright she was able to skip kindergarten and move right to first grade. Before she was even a year old, she could read--thanks to her grandfather's tutelage--from the <mark>King James</mark> Bible. She \"was ridiculously advanced in state test scores\" as an elementary student, she was in a gifted-and-talented program as an eighth grader, and she regularly brought home straight A's, she said. Then, when she was 15, she was shattered by a sexual assault in a hotel, leaving her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Self-medicating soon led to a disastrous spiral of substance abuse. Though she'd vowed to herself to go through her senior year sober, that promise--like countless ones before--went unfulfilled, and she missed nearly the entire first week in a haze of drugs before landing at the Alternative Learning Center, or ALC, in October. Every time she used drugs, she said, she knew she was breaking her parents' hearts, but she could never get clean in her social circle comprised of other heavy drug users who she knew were pulling her down. Finally, on New Year's, as she sat surrounded by drugs and deeply under the influence friends, she experienced the epiphany that it was neither kindness nor love she was experiencing, and that they didn't care about each other: They just fed each other drugs. \"I don't want to be around these people or drugs anymore,\" she said about her realization. She separated herself from them, and she's been sober since the first of the year. In February, she also cut ties with \"an emotionally-abusive\" now-ex-boyfriend who encouraged her drug use, she said. In the past few months, she's befriended peers at the ALC who support her sobriety, and both her grades and attendance have markedly improved. Instead of bragging to peers about her drug-and-alcohol-fueled exploits, Haskell now cautions others from following her self-destructive path, she said. \"I could've died so many times,\" said Haskell. Ditching drugs has also helped her rebuild her relationship \"beyond belief\" with her parents, whom she'd shut out while abusing drugs, she said. Now, she can bring reputable friends home with her and talk with her mother and father about their days, as opposed to dashing up the stairs to her room as soon as she walked in the door so her parents wouldn't see in her eyes she was high again. Haskell said there's no chance she'd be in the position she is today--poised to graduate on time later this month, sober, and heading to college in the fall to become a nurse--if not for the teachers at the ALC. \"They care so much about your home life, and they really want you to succeed,\" Haskell said as tears welled in her eyes. \"They have to deal with a lot, but they do it so well .\" Haskell has settled on nursing as a career because her mother was a nurse, as was her mother's mother, and \"my parents raised me on service,\" she said. In addition, Haskell is now working with elderly dementia patients at a local nursing home. \"My parents are such good examples of service to other people being gratifying,\" she said. \"To look them in the eyes and know they respect me back is such a huge thing for me .\" Between her parents, friends and teachers, Haskell now has a motivational support system as she prepares to leave the warm embrace of the ALC for college this fall, she said. In addition, she'll glance at her MAAP STARS awards every day as a reminder of what she can achieve by attending class, studying for tests and remaining sober. ALC STARS shine bright Haskell's performance in Edina last week was all the more impressive considering it was her first time at the conference, as it was for the handful of other students who represented Owatonna's ALC there, said Ray Ostfeld, a math teacher at the ALC and the MAAP STARS adviser. Owatonna's ALC has been participating in MAAP STARS \"about as long as there's been an ALC,\" but this was Ostfeld's first year as the adviser. Students participated in various activities, both individual and team, from public speaking to employment interviews, he added. The competitions concentrate on building leaders and career development. \"The way they taught you life skills was awesome,\" Haskell said. \"It really stuck in your head .\" Furthermore, \"you definitely become a leader,\" she said. \"It's definitely for everyone, and I told all the people I know when I got back to school to get into MAAP STARS .\" Because so much of the conference \"is planned down the minute,\" students also learned valuable time-management skills, she said. \"Being in charge of your own time is very adult-like .\" Haskell was also impressed by the sheer amount of volunteers working the event, showing they care about the students, she said. Furthermore, the event was conducted at \"a really beautiful hotel, which I don't think a lot of kids [who were] there get on a regular basis .\" Haskell first learned about the possibility from her sister, Ally, who participated in MAAP STARS and told her \"it was a blast, and it taught you a lot about growing up,\" she said. \"It really does, and we could all benefit from that .\" For example, the critique sheets from judges helped students improve their employment interviews in later rounds, she said. \"We really took their comments to heart .\" Though the articulate Haskell had long been told she more than held her own in conversations with adults despite her youth, she didn't expect to finish second out of more than 200 students in the employment interview, she said. Instead, her focus was on the public speaking category, where she also excelled, finishing sixth out of more than 150 contestants. \"I really like public speaking, and I prepared for weeks,\" she said. \"I rewrote it and rewrote it and rewrote it .\" Though Haskell had a remarkable story to tell of her education journey, her speech needed to fit within a five to seven minute time frame, Ostfeld said. \"She was so receptive to reworking it repeatedly, and she deserves her\" accolades. Because her father, Keith, is a pastor (at Bridges of Hope Community Church), and she often helped him at events, Haskell grew up with public speaking, she said. \"I did introductions for him, and he trained me to be comfortable with public speaking,\" she said. While in high school, Haskell's mother, Kathleen, also excelled in public speaking, receiving recognition for a speech she gave about her mother's death from ALS. When Haskell told her mother she was going to give a speech for MAAP STARS and \"follow in her footsteps,\" Kathleen's advice was succinct: \"Do something personal .\" So Haskell shared the painful details of her educational journey for the first time publicly. Adding to the irony was the fact the first day of the conference--at a hotel--took place on the two-year anniversary of her own hotel nightmare, she said. \"It was emotional, but also more meaningful because I overcame that,\" she said. Haskell discovered \"it's easier to tell strangers than people close to you,\" she said. \"Family and friends have this weird pity, and they're afraid to talk about it, but judges understand, and I could cry with them knowing I was being heard .\" A judge even hugged Haskell and cried herself, she added. \"I didn't know they could do that .\" Haskell also credited ALC social studies teacher Don Hettinga, who accompanied the group as a pinch hitter for Ostfeld, who was unable to attend due to a death in his family. Hettinga's presence also added poignancy to the ALC's community service project, Pennies for Patience, as he's a cancer survivor. \"Everybody knew (Hettinga),\" Haskell said. \"It was so cool .\" Though not a particularly close-knit group prior to the conference, the six students from Owatonna bonded while at MAAP STARS, she said. It was neat \"to get close to people\" with similar interests and goals, and \"we became a little family .\" Stories of redemption like Haskell's are a reason \"I don't want to do anything else\" but teach at an ALC, said Ostfeld, who is in his second year in Owatonna after nine years at a Rochester ALC. \"It has its challenges every day, but to see students walk across the stage on graduation day--my favorite day of the year--with their diplomas, beaming with pride, knowing what they've been through, and what they're capable of, makes everything worthwhile,\" said Ostfeld. Though earning a high school diploma \"doesn't seem like a lot to people outside this building, it means a lot to us,\" Haskell said. \"That diploma is a reminder every morning that I can do it .\" Indeed, Ostfeld spends much of his time convincing students they can excel, and they often do, he said. He tried to remind them \"the past is the past, and it's never too late for anything .\" ", "articleID": "2017050322_00663503_W", "names": {"King James": ["Q17100723", "Q36159"]}}, {"date": "2017-05-04", "url": "http://wtam.com/onair/glenn-beck-56047/paul-ryan-and-the-gop-make-15802479/", "content": "<mark>Paul Ryan</mark> and the GOP Make Lindsey Graham Look Like Benjamin Franklin posted by The <mark>Glenn Beck</mark> Program - 1 hour ago share Well, it looks like Republicans are going to pull a Nancy Pelosi with the Obamacare replacement bill.

A Pakistani victim of cross border firing rests at a hospital in Quetta, Pakistan, Friday, May 5, 2017. Afghan security forces backed by artillery fired without provocation on Pakistani census workers and soldiers escorting them...By <mark>ABDUL SATTAR</mark> and MUNIR AHMEDAssociated Press QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) - Backed by artillery, Afghan security forces fired across the border on Pakistani census workers and troops escorting them on Friday, killing nine and drawing a response from the military, Pakistan said. On the Afghan side, officials reported six killed in the incident, a significant escalation of hostilities between the two neighbors. Pakistani government and military officials said the artillery rounds that hit in the border town of Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan province were unprovoked but Afghan provincial officials claimed that the Pakistanis fired first. The incident was the latest escalation between the two neighbors who share a volatile and porous boundary. Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said the army shut the border crossing in Chaman in response to the early morning attack, blocking all movement of people and supplies to its landlocked neighbor. Residents in the area said Pakistani and Afghan security personnel exchanged fire using light and heavy weapons. \"So far, we have received nine bodies. These civilians were killed as a result of the Afghan shelling,\" said Akhtar Mohammad, a doctor at the state-run hospital in Chaman. At least 42 people were reported wounded on the Pakistani side, including women and children, and Mohammad said some of the wounded were in critical condition. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued a statement describing the Afghan firing as \"unfortunate\" and urged Kabul to put an end to cross-border attacks that threaten efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan. Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman Nafeez Zakaria said the census workers were on their side of the border when Afghan forces opened fire. According to local residents, dozens of shells slammed into nearby villages, as well as close to the regional headquarters of Pakistan's paramilitary forces. Several of the wounded said their homes were destroyed in the exchange. Gen. Abdul Raziq, the police chief in Afghanistan's Kandahar province, blamed Pakistan for initiating the gunbattle. He accused Islamabad of using the census as a mask to conceal the crossing of militants from Pakistan into Afghanistan. Raziq said six people - four Afghan policemen and two civilians - were killed while another 37 were wounded by Pakistani forces' fire. Among the Afghan wounded were 23 civilians. \"Pakistani forces were trying to infiltrate Afghan territory but Afghan forces stopped them; that's when the fight started,\" said Raziq. In Islamabad, the foreign ministry said it had summoned Afghanistan's charg\u00e9 d'affaires to complain about the firing. Pakistan and Afghanistan routinely accuse each other of providing sanctuaries to their enemy insurgents - something both sides deny. Despite several high-level visits by Pakistani intelligence and security officials to Afghanistan in recent weeks, relations between the two countries continue to deteriorate. Gen. Ghafoor also accused Afghan forces of creating obstacles for census workers in villages divided by the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. He did not elaborate on what those obstacles entailed. Later Friday, the Pakistani military said a hotline had been established between the two sides and that the cross-border shooting had stopped. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Sahir Shamshad Mirza asked the Afghan military to ensure its forces stay on their side and take every step to \"defuse the situation\" while the Pakistani military would \"work within our own border .\" Pakistan shares a 2,200-kilometer - (1,375 mile -) long porous border with Afghanistan. Pakistan currently hosts 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees and another 1 million unregistered. They routinely get caught in the middle when tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalate. Pakistan started conducting a nationwide census in mid-March, with censor-takers going door-to-door to collect information. The census - the country's first since 1998 - has reignited a centuries-old border dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The boundary, known as the Durand Line - named for Sir Henry Mortimer Durand, the former British diplomat who first established the border in 1896 - runs through vast ethnic Pashtun areas on both sides, in some places straight through villages. Any attempt to make the border a permanent one has been fiercely opposed by Afghanistan. The two countries routinely squabble over the disputed border line, incidents which at times escalate into armed conflict. In March this year former Afghan President Hamid Karzai again said that Afghanistan would never accept the Durand Line as an international border, stoking fears on the Pakistani side. ___ Ahmed reported from Islamabad.
