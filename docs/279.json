Health bosses from both the Western Sussex Hospital Trust and Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which awarded Bupa CSH Ltd a \u00a3 235m musculoskeletal (MSK) contract, were before West Sussex County Council's Health and Social Care committee on Friday December 5. An independent impact assessment into the decision was jointly commissioned by the Trust and CCG after Western bosses went public with fears that its accident and emergency units at Chichester's St Richard's Hospital and Worthing Hospital could suffer as a result of the deal. Both are used by South Downs residents. One question asked by GP and committee vice chairman Dr <mark>James Walsh</mark> was why private procurement was chosen over public bidders. Marie Dodd, the CCG's chief operations officer, said legal advice made it clear there was \"no other option' but to offer the services out to tender. She said:\" The CCG (sought legal guidance) and reluctantly had to accept the advice that procurement was going to be the best vehicle, and the required vehicle for us to use in those circumstances. \"Dr Katie Armstrong, chief officer at the CCG, said a summary of the assessment would be made public once both bodies had studied it in full. The results will be shared with committee members ahead of HASC's next meeting on January 21, 2015. Committee's chairman, <mark>Margaret Evans</mark>, said:\" We will look very closely at the impact assessment's results as the MSK contract has been a matter of significant concern to the committee and to the public. * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.

I doubt if that's how he sees it. As he watches pictures of traffic flowing through the heart of Admiralty today, he will certainly feel relieved that he didn't lose. But he is fighting a multi-level multi-player game. He has merely survived a level. This is not to say he didn't play adroitly. By leaving the protests to burn out amidst their own divisions and the weariness of the wider Hong Kong public, he deprived the umbrella movement of the oxygen of repression and demonstrated that Beijing's tool kit for dealing with citizen defiance runs beyond tanks or truncheons. What's more, he made no concessions. The lesson that Beijing does not bow to pressure was delivered not just to Hong Kong but to the world. But the only real victory Beijing can claim in the entire episode is not in Hong Kong but at home on the mainland where, barring a few brave souls who raised their voices on behalf of Hong Kong democracy, little stirred. The main thoroughfare in Admiralty is now open to traffic, with hardly any traces of the protest camp This is an important victory for the propaganda machine, which successfully presented the protesters as a mix of spoilt children narrowly pursuing their own interests at the expense of the public good, and cunning enemies of the state in league with foreign forces. \"Any person who cares about Hong Kong and about the people of Hong Kong should say\" NO' to this hijacking of the general public will for personal objectives, \"said the Communist Party flagship newspaper, the People's Daily. Champions of democracy everywhere take note - the aspirations of the young protesters of Hong Kong did not immediately resonate with their counterparts on the mainland. Despite being beneficiaries of globalisation and despite having ever greater contact with the West through university education and holidays abroad, many young Chinese are suspicious of idealistic political messages. Since childhood, they have been exposed to a historical narrative which dwells on China's humiliation at the hands of foreigners. Many now echo their government's suspicion of street protests, social chaos and foreign ideas peddled by people whose hidden agenda may be to divide China and keep it down. According to China's best known military theorist, Sun Tzu (writing two-and-a-half thousand years ago), the best kind of victory is won without fighting. Seeing the mainland stable throughout two-and-a-half months of street protest in Hong Kong is just such a victory. But provoking thousands of citizens onto the streets in the first place is, by the same token, no kind of victory at all. Beijing brought the umbrella movement on itself. Protesters have vowed to continue with their campaign With its white paper in June and electoral arrangements in August, it made clear that it would not only draw up a narrower political board game in Hong Kong but control the pieces too. Hong Kong citizens were already resentful of the scale of mainland tourism and immigration, and the young alienated by a growing list of frustrations including impossible property prices. In this combustible mix, Beijing's announcements were the proverbial sparks that lit the prairie fire. Sun Tzu would have called this self-inflicted injury. The electoral arrangements were intended to avoid future challenges from an elected Hong Kong leader. But instead they provoked a very present challenge from at least 100,000 citizens. For a government which likes to reinforce the impression that it is in charge of not just the staging but the script, Hong Kong was an uncomfortable discovery that the props can get up and misbehave. Ever since Chairman Mao's ideological experiments resulted in the deaths of countless millions in the 1950s and 1960s, China's Communist leaders have insisted that they believe in\" seeking truth from facts \". The sobering fact in relation to the Umbrella Movement is that a generation of young people in Hong Kong is increasingly politicised and alienated from China. With their demand for democratic rights, the members of the umbrella movement effectively rebranded themselves\" not China \". Alex Chow (L) and <mark>Joshua Wong</mark> (R) are two prominent Hong Kong student leaders who have led the protests The same is true in Taiwan. Despite all of Beijing's efforts to coax the island towards reunification, the message from recent local elections as well as from the Sunflower Movement in the spring is that the Taiwanese public and especially its young people, are moving in the opposite direction. Far from assimilating easily to an increasingly wealthy China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are growing more defiant. And adding to the list of troublesome peripheries whose citizens can't be trusted to behave like true Chinese patriots, let's not forget Xinjiang. So while Xi Jinping will go on talking up his China Dream and urging the young people of China to unite behind it, he must have realised by now that his message is struggling with key audiences. Hong Kong has seen a generation of young people devote energy, passion and sacrifice into a competing dream. These are people he needs on his side. Xi Jinping may not have lost in Hong Kong, but he needs to do much, much more if he is going to win. For weeks there was a life-size cardboard cut-out of President Xi amid the tent city of the Umbrella Movement, holding aloft the obligatory yellow umbrella. It's a shame he didn't visit. 2 Minutes ago Do the Chinese close down their comment sections at six. Unless they are in advertising territory of course?\" If he (Xi) starts trying to assimilate Hong Kong into his Chinese Dream then I can imagine an even larger protest emerging \"--That should have him quaking! Hit China financially and things could change. But too many vested interests around the world will not allow that to happen. While whitey is getting rich, nothing will change...it's the way of the world. China will do what China wants, Russia will do what Russia wants, Israel will do what Israel wants.

Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm. Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of <mark>O'Neill</mark>'s. \"Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!\" commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled. <mark>O'Neill</mark> had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist <mark>Kevin Williamson</mark> interviewed the celebrated war hero. \"It was nothing really. Those kids didn't have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,\" <mark>O'Neill</mark> stated. The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.

That is the equivalent of 12 Big Macs, and three times the daily recommended amount of calories for a woman, and just under 2 and a half more than a man's. A survey of 2,000 UK adults also showed that 46 per cent us don't consider the amount we eat on Christmas Day, or any other day of the year. It also revealed that half of us are ditching the traditional Christmas turkey meal on 25 December.
