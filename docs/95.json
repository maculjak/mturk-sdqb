One of the assumptions I made in those scenarios was that Dallas would defeat San Antonio last night. So I threw it on the ground. Because I'm an adult and not a part of your system I had almost a fully flushed out word document with the new scenarios which took into account the Dallas loss - then Golden State lost to the Nuggets. That loss brought all sorts of other tiebreaker scenarios to the forefront and broke my brain entirely. But since I'm nice - here's roughly where we are tiebreaker wise: Suns/Mavericks - head to head even at 1-1, winner of Saturday's game wins the tiebreaker. Suns/Grizzlies - Grizzlies are up 3-0 on head to head and have already won the tiebreaker. Grizzlies/Mavericks - Mavericks are up 3-0 head to head and have already won the tiebreaker. Suns/Warriors - head to head is even at 2-2 so we move to the next tiebreaker for teams in the same division - division record, which is clinched by GSW already (10-5 to 7-8). Suns/Mavs/Grizz - the tiebreaker is record in games among the three teams, Dallas is 4-1, Memphis is 3-3, and Phoenix is 1-4. Each team has 2 to play. The only way this goes well for the Suns is if Memphis loses their last 2 and the Suns win their last 2 but if that happens there won't be a 3 way tie anyway. Suns/Grizz/Warriors - same three way tiebreaker. Memphis is 5-2 (2-2 against GSW, 3-0 against Phoenix), Golden State is 4-4 (2-2 against Phoenix/Memphis), and Phoenix is 2-5 (0-3 against Memphis, 2-2 against GSW). Suns would be dead here. Suns/Mavs/Warriors - same three way tiebreaker. Golden State is 5-3 (2-2 against Phoenix, 3-1 against Dallas), Phoenix is 3-3 (2-2 against Golden State, 1-1 against Dallas), and Dallas is 2-4 (1-1 against Phoenix, 1-3 against Golden State). In the highly unlikely (and potentially impossible event the Suns lose to Dallas and tie these teams, they're done. If any of that is wrong feel free to correct me - I'm sitting in a staff meeting at the moment. Thursday April 10th Key Western Conference Results: Recap) - <mark>Tony Parker</mark> didn't play for the Spurs but it didn't matter. Hell Patty Mills took 25 shots and only scored 26 points and it still didn't matter (although it helped he shot 6/11 from three). The Spurs are really good at winning games. Monta Ellis led the Mavericks with 24 points and you're not reading this part so I'm just going to go into a shopping list - I need cereal and milk. I like cereals with cartoon mascots on the box. Recap) - I'll admit I barely even bothered to watch this game because I thought the Full Squad would take care of business. The Nuggets trailed this game by as many as 12 in the 3rd quarter but the heavenly ascension of Timofey Mosgov (23 points and 29 - yes 29 - rebounds) allowed them to keep it close. It looked like Golden State was going to survive when Steph Curry hit a floater with 5 seconds left but Denver got the ball into Kenneth Faried who hit a shot in the lane to take the game. Steph Curry led Golden State with 24 points and Klay Thompson added 21. LOST 1 - Memphis 46 Friday April 11th Western Conference Games of Significance: Suns @ Spurs - At this point of the morning we don't really even know who's going to play for either team. Coro reported that Dragic is questionable with an ankle injury (roughly his 10 millionth) while other reports suggest both <mark>Tony Parker</mark> and <mark>Tim Duncan</mark> are going to sit out tonight. <mark>Parker</mark> has sat the last two games while <mark>Duncan</mark> suffered a bit of a knee scare in the 1st half last night but still played 39 minutes. I don't think there's any shame in saying we have no clue what's going to happen tonight, so I'll say Spurs by 10. 76ers @ Grizzlies - I hear a lot of you say things like \"anything can happen any night in the NBA\" and \"they're all NBA players\" - but when your team has won 2 games since February started I don't think any of that applies. The Sixers are bad and they should feel bad. Memphis will win this game by 73. Need a morning laugh? Go check out the Philly roster. Warriors @ Lakers - Won't some other playoff contender sleepwalk through a game with a bad Lakers team and take a horrible loss? If so I'd really appreciate it. The odds are against Golden State suffering a second consecutive bad loss but at least the Lakers are sort of an NBA team - unlike Philly.

By Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.

Wyden's bid to cut regulations, taxes on craft brewers PORTLAND, Ore. - Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore ., said Friday he has introduced legislation that would promote continued job creation in the growing craft beverage, cider, wine and distillery industries throughout Oregon and the country. The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, S. 1562, introduced Thursday, would cut taxes and modernize outdated regulations for craft brewers, cider makers, vintners, and distillers. Junction City police chief sues city, ex-administrator Most Oregon sex offenders not listed on public website Bundy denies firing gunshots near US researchers in Nevada In Oregon, those industries are responsible for an estimated 40,000 jobs collectively and generate about $6 billion annually in revenue. \"Oregon's craft beer, wine, cider and spirits producers are both world-renowned and a huge boon to our state's economy,\" said Wyden, co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Small Brewers Caucus. \"Each of these industries is unique, and this legislation takes targeted approaches to update antiquated rules and reduce taxes for these growing businesses to ensure that these innovators continue to create high-quality jobs for Oregonians,\" added Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees excise taxes and alcohol regulations. Wyden's legislation builds on a consensus reached among multiple industry groups. And it builds on a number of popular proposals, including the Small BREW Act sponsored by Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md .) and <mark>Susan Collins</mark> (R-Maine); the Fair BEER Act sponsored by Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo .) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc .); the Distillery Excise Tax Reform Act sponsored by Senator <mark>Gary Peters</mark> (D-Mich .); the CIDER Act sponsored by Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.); the AGED Spirits Act sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky .); and the Craft Beverage Bond Simplification Act, which was approved by the Finance Committee earlier this year. In addition, Wyden's legislation includes a variety of new proposals to reduce tax and regulatory burdens for each industry. \"As co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Small Brewers Caucus, Senator Wyden has been a longtime champion for America's craft brewers and we appreciate his strong support,\" said Bob Pease, CEO of the Brewers Association. \"He has been diligently working to reduce federal excise taxes for craft brewers through his co-sponsorship of the Small BREW Act. Now with the introduction of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, Senator Wyden has gone even further to ensure growth for small and independent brewers .\" \"We applaud Senator Wyden for this positive step forward in addressing beer excise tax reform in a fair, equitable and comprehensive way,\" said Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, a national trade association representing brewers, beer importers and industry suppliers. \"The beer-specific provisions of this bill will help brewers and beer importers of all sizes. We look forward to working with the Senator and our industry partners to build support for this important legislation .\" \"Oregon's breweries contribute mightily to our state's economy and Senator Wyden's legislation will allow our small businesses to build on what they've done naturally for decades - create good-paying jobs all across our state,\" said Deschutes Brewery Founder <mark>Gary</mark> Fish, Board Chair of the Brewers Association. \"A fresh approach to eliminating outdated regulations and lowering taxes is a recipe for breweries' uniquely Oregon success story to continue for years to come .\" \"The Oregon Winegrowers Association thanks Senator Wyden for his continuing support and leadership on issues that help improve the competitiveness of Oregon's craft beverage brands,\" said Association Board Director and Treasurer Steve Thomson, Executive Vice President at King Estate Winery. \"Under his proposal, Oregon's midsize and small family wineries would see a significant new tax benefit, enabling them to reinvest in their businesses and further fuel the wine industry's growth and contribution to the Oregon economy. Currently Oregon's 605 wineries, 950 vineyards, and related businesses account for 17,100 jobs, $208 million in tourism, and $3.35 billion in total annual economic impact spread across Oregon's 36 counties .\" \"I am excited to a see very progressive and comprehensive approach to positively change the excise tax for the cider industry, dramatically improve the small producer credit so growth is not taxed excessively and at the same time offer our regulating body, the TTB, more funds to assist our growing industry with compliance,\" said James Kohn, owner of Salem-based Wandering Aengus Ciderworks. \"The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation that tackles some of the most significant barriers that America's distillers currently face, and it provides a measure of excise tax parity that will boost investment and create new jobs in communities across the country,' said Thomas Mooney, President of the American Craft Spirits Association and Co-Owner & CEO of House Spirits Distillery in Portland .\" These issues are important to the rapidly growing number of American craft distillers, and this bill comes only days after the introduction of the bipartisan Distillery Innovation and Excise Tax Reform Act of 2015 (HR 2520) in the House. On behalf of more than 700 distillers across the country, and as an Oregon distiller myself, I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership in taking on these important issues in the Senate. \"In addition to providing tax relief for Oregon's brewers, cider makers, vintners, and distillers, this legislation would also reduce compliance burdens for craft beverage producers by exempting nearly 90 percent of all industry members from complex bonding and bi-weekly tax filing requirements. The bill would exempt aged beers, ciders, wines, and spirits from complicated and burdensome accounting rules. It would reform rules on brewers to encourage more collaboration and streamline regulations. And it would equalize the playing field for all distilled spirits producers. Finally, this bill would cut administrative backlogs by ensuring the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is charged with regulating these industries, is sufficiently funded. Additional enforcement funding and authority would help offset the cost of this bill by cracking down on tax cheats. Copyright 2015 KTVZ. All rights reserved.

Jerusalem Post August 24, 2018 As <mark>Trump</mark> and Erdogan dig in, the chances that the two countries can return to a stable relationship is shrinking. Turkey and Turks \"Turkey buying the Russian S-400 missile defense system would threaten the security of our F-35 aircraft and let Putin collect critical intelligence on us. We must pass my provision in the defense bill this week to block the F-35 delivery until Turkey ends its deal with Russia,\" wrote US Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Wednesday. His comments came a day after US National Security Adviser <mark>John Bolton</mark>, visiting Jerusalem, said that Ankara made a \"big mistake\" by not releasing US Pastor Andrew Brunson. \"Every day that goes by, that mistake continues. This crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release pastor Brunson without condition .\" In Turkey the comments by <mark>Bolton</mark> were met with anger. Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman and adviser to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that Turkey's judicial independence was being challenged by Washington. \"There is a rule of law in Turkey, and the Andrew Brunson case is a legal issue. There is an ongoing legal process related to this individual,\" Kalin said. Turkey and the US face their greatest diplomatic crisis in recent memory as both countries engage in a war of words that has also harmed the Turkish economy. Five years ago, $1 was worth two lira. Now you can get six liras for the same dollar. In the last month the lira lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar. This has caused a crisis in Turkey, in which Qatar has now pledged $15 billion to support the Turkish economy, further tying Ankara and Doha together. It has also caused Turkey to strengthen its ties to Moscow. Over the last three years Turkey has increasingly grown closer to Moscow, Qatar and Iran on a variety of issues. But Ankara had hoped briefly that <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s election in October 2016 would bring warmer relations. The view from Ankara is that the US has been working with allies of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) in Syria. The PKK's Syrian affiliate is named the People's Protection Units (YPG). The YPG has been the main force fighting ISIS in Syria since 2014, and the US helped the YPG push ISIS back from Kobani in 2015 and then began to work closely with the YPG in its rebranded form as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF liberated Raqqa last year, and the US is increasing its footprint in Syria, sending new special envoys and diplomatic staff, as well as securing hundreds of millions in assistance for stabilization from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey's conduit to <mark>Trump</mark>'s White House was supposed to be <mark>Michael Flynn</mark>, <mark>Trump</mark>'s first national security adviser. According to the BBC Ankara asked for <mark>Flynn</mark>'s help in getting a cleric named Fethullah Gulen deported from the US back to Turkey, where he faced charges connected to the 2016 coup attempt. But <mark>Flynn</mark> was fired by <mark>Trump</mark> and got snared in the Russia collusion investigation of Robert Mueller. Erdogan flew to Washington in May 2017 to meet <mark>Trump</mark>. But the visit turned sour when Turkish security personnel were filmed beating up protesters next to the Turkish Embassy in an embarrassing and unprecedented incident. Things went downhill slowly from there. Turkish officials repeatedly warned that Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies wanted to move on Manbij in northern Syria, a town held by the SDF east of the Euphrates. Instead, in January 2018, Turkey and its Syrian rebels invaded Afrin in northwestern Syria, a small Kurdish canton held by the YPG. This angered the SDF, which shifted forces from fighting ISIS and warned the Americans that they shouldn't abandon their friends in Syria. After Turkey took Afrin in March 2018, it set its sights again on Manbij. In June 2018 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Ankara and worked up a \"road map\" on Manbij with Ankara. There would be independent patrols around the town, with Turkish and US troops coordinating. These were supposed to lead to \"joint patrols,\" but in August Secretary of Defense <mark>James Mattis</mark> said there were more details to be ironed out. The problems in Manbij were playing out against the larger dispute between Ankara and Washington. The pawn in this dispute became Brunson, who had been arrested in Turkey and accused of being connected to the coup plot. \"A fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason,\" <mark>Trump</mark> tweeted on April 17. \"A total disgrace that Turkey will not release respected US Pastor,\" he tweeted again on July 18. According to a report on Ynet, <mark>Trump</mark>'s team sought out a deal with Ankara where Israel would release a Turkish woman detained for ties to Hamas, in exchange for Brunson. She was released and flew back to Turkey on July 15. But although Brunson was let out to house arrest on July 25, he wasn't released. <mark>Trump</mark>, apparently feeling betrayed, announced a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum on August 10. Since then the Turkish economy has been damaged. Average Turks have taken to the Internet to express anger, bashing iPhones, cutting up dollars and encouraging Muslims around the world to support the lira as a form of religious support for Turkey. This is part of the current mood in Ankara that is increasingly one that views the world through the lens of political Islam. But at the same time that Turkey asserts that the charges against Brunson are just an \"independent\" judicial issue, a report on The Wall Street Journal website claimed on August 20 that Ankara had proposed freeing the pastor in exchange for the end of a US investigation into a Turkish bank. Probably the story is more complex than that. Turkey also wants Gulen deported. The fact that two \"deals\" regarding Brunson were reportedly in the works seems to indicate that the story of \"judicial independence\" is not entirely rock solid. Turkey is willing to negotiate. That calls into question what exact evidence there is regarding Brunson. The <mark>Trump</mark> administration has made Brunson the centerpiece of its policy, as opposed to discussing wider issues such as why Turkey is buying the S-400 from Russia and Turkey's role in Syria. US media have begun to discuss whether the NATO alliance with Turkey is beneficial. \"Time for Turkey and NATO to go their separate ways,\" reads a piece in The Washington Post. Another piece at Foreign Policy says, \"<mark>Trump</mark> is the first president to get Turkey right .\" The rift was already there, says The National Interest. Indeed, the rift has been growing for more than a decade since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, when Turkey rejected a proposal to base US troops on its soil. The problem with the <mark>Trump</mark> administration's crackdown on Turkey relations is that it could be reversed easily if the pastor is released. It could also change dramatically when <mark>Trump</mark> leaves office, as the next US administration will seek to do the opposite of everything <mark>Trump</mark> did. In US foreign policy circles, there is a vibrant pro-Turkey lobby that argues for \"engagement\" with Ankara, that worries that any pressure from the US will result in Turkey's growing embrace of Iran and Russia. It sees the SDF as a temporary ally, a group that was convenient when fighting ISIS, but which can be quietly abandoned in the next few years, as Washington maneuvers back to Ankara, which is seen as a 70-year ally since the start of the Cold War. These voices ignore Turkey's own agency and independent policy. They don't see Turkey as a full-fledged country making its own choices. They see it as only reacting to whatever the US is doing. But Turkey's crackdown on the press and frequent outbursts in Ankara harshly slamming various European countries or the US are not just reactions; they represent a growing Turkish national wand religious consensus. <mark>Trump</mark> could make a deal, but the long-term relationship will likely remain unstable.
