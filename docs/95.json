read all the details here at & t won't \"speculate' on plans to match verizon's iphone wi-fi tethering with verizon announcing plans to offer its iphone 4 customers the option to tether several devices to the handset's 3g connection over wi-fi, rival at & t is remaining mum on whether it plans to match that offer for its own iphone customers. iphone announcement tuesday, verizon said that each iphone 4 for its network will come bundled with a free 3g mobile hotspot app for tethering the handset's data connection over wi-fi to up to 5 devices, such as notebooks, ipads, ipods and other mobile devices. upon closer inspection following the announcement, it appears that the hotspot app is actually a native component built into the yet-to-be-released ios version 4.2.5, which was running on the cdma iphone 4 handsets present at verizon's presentation tuesday. verizon is likely to charge a standard monthly fee for the actual tethering service, though pricing details were note made available as part of tuesday's announcements. nevertheless, the offer promises more flexibility that at & t's existing tethering option for iphone customers, which offers tethering only via bluetooth or usb for $20 per month. that means at & t iphone users can't have their ipad (and most other devices outside of macs and pcs) piggyback on their handset's data connection. when asked by appleinsider

brady hoke as its new football coach on tuesday, hours after lsu said les miles would be staying in the bayou. hoke is not a michigan man - he's a ball state alumnus - but he is a former wolverines assistant and athletic director dave brandon praised him highly in announcing the decision. \"we are pleased to announce the hiring of brady,\" brandon said. \"he is a terrific coach and will be a great ambassador and leader for our football program. we look forward to having him build a championship program on the field and in the classroom .\" hoke, who will be introduced at a news conference in ann arbor on wednesday, spent eight seasons as a head coach at ball state (2003-08) before leading the aztecs (2009-10). a defensive line coach at michigan, hoke helped the defense lead the nation in rushing defense and was on the staff during the 1997 national championship run. during his tenure, michigan went 5-3 against rivals michigan state and ohio state and in bowl games. he replaces

taking the job. his latest decision was a big one, too. brandon needed to find a new coach who would fit in on the field and campus along with exciting a fan base and donors who fill the big house and still new luxury suites. whether hoke can do those things is an open question and the last week was full of speculation that miles would be the best choice brandon could make. the lsu coach was a popular choice among fans when carr announced he was retiring after the 2007 season, but he stayed in baton rouge then and did again this time around.", "articleID": "2011011121_00173399_W", "names":

going under in the next few months. i think that a lot of those firms that survived the summer cull but were left fragile will have been hit by christmas and i think that could be the nail in a lot of

year with cautious optimism as, while trading conditions appear to be on the up, it is difficult to know what state the economy will be in several months down the line. so with that in mind, the plan

the new york islanders will try to get back on track and avoid a fourth straight loss when they welcome the buffalo sabres for tonight's battle at nassau coliseum. new york, which is seeded 14th out of 15 teams in the eastern conference, had been playing its best hockey of the season just a few weeks back, but the isles have lost three in a row after going 8-2-1 in their previous 11 games. new york had also won three straight on home ice before losing the first two games of its current five-game homestand. the isles are just 7-8-4 as the host club this season. the islanders are 0-2-1 during their current three-game slide, which is the team's worst skid since it dropped six in a row from dec. 2-13. new york's most recent setback came thursday evening against visiting ottawa, which halted a six-game losing streak with a 6-4 victory at the coliseum. robin lehner recorded a win in his first nhl start with 20 saves for the senators. milan jurcina posted a goal and an assist for the islanders. trevor gillies, p.a. parenteau and blake comeau each tallied in the loss. kevin poulin started the game for new york, but after giving up two goals on eight shots, he was pulled in favor for nathan lawson, who then gave up four second period goals. poulin came back in the third where he made 11 saves. \"i don't think they played bad,\" parenteau said of the isles' goalie play. \"there was a few bad bounces in the second period. i don't think we played very well in front them .\" with regular starter rick dipietro hampered by a strained adductor muscle, it is expected that either poulin or fellow rookie lawson will get the start tonight. isles forward frans nielsen is also questionable for tonight after missing the last five games with a strained groin. tonight marks the first of four meetings between the isles and sabres this season. the entire season series will be contested over the span of a month, as the clubs will meet for a home-and-home set on jan. 21 and 23 before capping the series in buffalo on feb. 13. the clubs split four meetings a year ago, but the sabres have taken six of the last 10 encounters overall. buffalo has dropped three straight and five of its last seven tilts on long island. the sabres have won three of their last four games and they have suffered just one regulation loss in seven games (5-1-1). the lone regulation setback over that span came in tuesday's 5-2 loss to philadelphia, but buffalo was able to rebound two nights later with a win against carolina <mark>ryan miller</mark> made 27 saves and thomas vanek set up two goals, helping the sabres skate to the 3-2 win over the visiting hurricanes. nathan gerbe, cody mccormick, and drew stafford also scored for the sabres. \"we were smarter, we were more patient and we gained momentum as we went on,\" sabres head coach lindy ruff said. buffalo is 9-8-4 as the visiting team this year and will shoot for a third straight road victory tonight. what you should know about new

tweet louisville, colo., jan. 18, 2011 / prnewswire /--ghx, in partnership with healthcare providers and suppliers, achieved more than $730 million in documented savings across the north american healthcare supply chain last year, one of many key accomplishments reported in the company's 2011 business update. the company, which celebrated its tenth anniversary in march, continues to have the largest footprint in the healthcare supply chain with 8,490 provider facilities and 4,840 medical-surgical supplier divisions in north america, and an additional 1,500 provider organizations and 350 suppliers in europe, transacting business using ghx. to view the multimedia assets associated with this release, please click in recent 2010 reporting to its board of directors, which includes both independent board members and executives from organizations that participate as equity owners of ghx, the ghx network accounted for connectivity to hospitals representing more than 80 percent of licensed beds in the united states alone and to supplier organizations that deliver approximately 85 percent of the medical-surgical products sold in north america. ghx also connects providers and suppliers in nine european countries. the ghx network in the u.s. and canada is now driving more than $38 billion in electronic dollar volume through the exchange, an increase of more than 23 percent over transactions at the end of 2009, according to the report. a key milestone in 2010 was early success toward the company's \"5-in-5\" strategic goal of cutting $5 billion in healthcare costs over five years, which netted $734 million in savings for the industry in the first year--10 percent above the first-year goal set by ghx. according to president and ceo <mark>bruce johnson</mark>, the company expects to exceed those savings in subsequent years based on the research and development already underway at ghx. \"the industry is at an historic inflexion point,\" said <mark>johnson</mark>. \"to deliver a sustainable healthcare system, we strongly believe providers and suppliers must seek new models for engagement and collaboration in order to continue to cut costs from the system. this requires a new approach that increases goal alignment and data visibility, while providing even greater focus on positive patient outcomes .\" \"our mission is to make a measureable difference in healthcare efficiency and outcomes for patients,\" added <mark>johnson</mark>. \"initially healthcare organizations joined ghx because we provided an open and neutral global healthcare exchange. today we're transforming healthcare's linear supply chain into a personalized\" healthcare supply cloud,' working to provide 360-degree visibility into areas affecting clinical and financial performance. \"in its ongoing commitment to delivering great efficiencies and solutions to the healthcare industry, ghx funds double-digit reinvestment in the development of new products, services and markets. the company introduced seven new or enhanced products and services to improve the process by which healthcare providers search, source, procure, buy and pay for products. the company reported several marketplace trends it believes will continue to affect healthcare in the coming year: cost cutting and operational efficiencies - organizations continue to identify opportunities to cut even more costs. efficiency is extended to how products were utilized and how that translates into better clinical and financial outcomes. consolidation - bigger companies with cash will continue buying smaller companies? feeding their innovation pipeline and keeping products in development and production rather than let those small companies fail. on the other side of the equation, there is a need to push more care outside of the expensive acute care setting. there is a need to create organizations that have economies of scale and scope to invest in more supply chain expertise. single-owned hospitals will continue to struggle for profitability. globalization - the changing tide of healthcare is washing across the globe. reform is often debated as a u.s.-only initiative, but it's not. it's critical that the industry address how to drive more efficient care globally. the ability to deliver cost-efficient, quality care is a universal issue. standardization - the drive continues toward greater standardization. this will be foundational, based on more effective automation and more effective data-sharing. data synchronization and standardization, and regulations such as unique device identification will become increasingly important. about ghx global healthcare exchange, llc (ghx) makes healthcare more efficient by delivering software and services that enable both healthcare providers and suppliers to increase efficiency, lower costs and deliver better patient care. with the largest footprint in healthcare supply chain
