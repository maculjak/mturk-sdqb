Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images Last night, a pro-choice Democrat--who proudly aligned himself with a self-avowed socialist--almost won the House district where Koch Industries is headquartered. Back in November, Kansas's fourth district backed <mark>Donald Trump</mark> by 27 points, and then-GOP congressman (now, CIA Director) Mike Pompeo by 31. Five months later, Republican Ron Estes needed a visit from Ted Cruz, a robocall from the president, and an infusion of national money to secure a seven-point victory over the aforementioned Democrat, <mark>James Thompson</mark>, a Wichita civil rights lawyer who'd never held public office. That 24-point swing wasn't enough to shake the red off Kansas. But if Democrats can swing every congressional district by half that sum, they'll take back the House in 2018. Naturally, Republicans are eager to paint last night's vote as an anomaly--one that says less about their party's national liabilities than its local ones. Kansas's GOP governor Sam Brownback boasts a woeful 27 percent approval rating, thanks, in large part, to gaping holes in the state's budget. Ron Estes was Brownback's state treasurer. In other words: Estes wasn't just running as a member of an unpopular governor's cabinet, but as the one most closely tied to Brownback's biggest failure. If anything, the fact that the treasurer of a state with wrenching budget problems won at all is a testament to the Republican Party's vitality! This is fine! America is already great again! There are a couple problems with that story. To name the most obvious: The past three months have been replete with evidence that the Democratic base is highly mobilized. You can see it in the record-setting marches, town hall protests, massive traffic enjoyed by leftwing Facebook pages, the tight special election race in Georgia's sixth district, and in the $150,000 that the liberal blog, Daily Kos, convinced its readers to pony up for <mark>James Thompson</mark>'s long-shot campaign. But okay: Let's ignore all that. Let's stipulate that last night was all about Brownback. That would certainly offer vulnerable House Republicans short-term comfort. But in the long run, a repudiation of Brownback is just as--if not more threatening--to the Republican Party than a repudiation of Trump. Sam Brownback isn't unpopular for idiosyncratic, personal reasons. The governor didn't decimate his state's finances by spending public funds on sex workers; he did it by implementing the conservative movement's blueprint for utopia. Some readers may be familiar with the legend of the \"red state model,\" but for those who aren't, here are the Cliff Notes: The 2010 tea-party wave delivered Brownback to the Sunflower State's governor's mansion and Republican majorities to both houses of its legislature. Together, they passed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and repealed all income taxes on more than 100,000 businesses. They tightened welfare requirements, privatized the delivery of Medicaid, cut $200 million from the education budget, eliminated four state agencies and 2,000 government employees. In 2012, Brownback helped replace the few remaining moderate Republicans in the legislature with conservative true believers. The following January, after signing the largest tax cut in Kansas history, Brownback told the Wall Street Journal, \"My focus is to create a red-state model that allows the Republican ticket to say,\" See, we've got a different way, and it works. \"' The GOP's national leadership agreed: Voters should look to Kansas to see the Republican vision for the nation's future .\" This is exactly the sort of thing we [Republicans] want to do here, in Washington, but can't, at least for now, \"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of Brownback's Kansas. And the supply-side nostrum undergirding the governor's economic model--that massive tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves, via heightened economic growth (provided that you kick the undeserving poor out of their welfare hammocks)--is the same one on which all of <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>'s celebrated budgets are based. Of course, the GOP's\" different way \"didn't work. Instead of providing national Republicans with a winning advertisement for fiscal conservatism, it provided Kansas's government with giant revenue shortfalls, its economy with weaker job growth than neighboring states, and Brownback himself with one of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in America. For decades now, Republicans have been asking voters to trade pieces of their social safety net for stronger economic growth. Kansas took them up on that offer. It allowed its government to throw more than a thousand disabled Kansans off of Medicaid, cut millions from the state's university system, and, in some of its districts, shorten the K-through-12 school year. Here was their reward. No state economy has done worse over the last 5 years than right-wing paradise Kansas. https: //t.co/rWPjwqo17r pic.twitter.com/3AYsgQHMqZ--Bruce Bartlett (@ BruceBartlett) October 26, 2016 To say that Kansas didn't swing against the GOP because of Trump--but only because of Brownback--is to say that red America isn't souring on one particular Republican, but only on their party's entire economic philosophy. Last year, the Republican Party nominated a man who campaigned on a promise to deliver universal health-care, preserve Social Security and Medicare, and intervene in the free market to protect American jobs. Last month, Republicans in the Kansas legislature passed a bill to expand Medicaid in their state. President Trump has never been popular. But his approval rating began sliding in early March, right after <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> unveiled his plan to finance a large tax cut for the rich by throwing millions of low-income people off of their health insurance--an idea that enjoyed the backing of 17 percent of the electorate. Turns out Tea Party voters want more government healthcare spending, yet support <mark>Ryan</mark>'s healthcare bill. Go figure. https: //t.co/y77gXZHn6j pic.twitter.com/VT7W2FqDPC--Guy Kawasaki (@ GuyKawasaki) March 23, 2017 Path to Trump's base?

Following the chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians on Tuesday, Al-Masdar News, a pro-Assad website based in Beirut, published claims that \"something is not adding up in [the] Idlib chemical weapons attack .\" Its author cited \"holes\" in the accounts provided by the \"Al-Qaeda affiliated\" White Helmets leading to the conclusion that \"this is another false chemical attack allegation made against the government .\" That hoax story was promoted by a network of Russian social media accounts and ultimately picked up by popular alt-right personalities in the United States, including Mike Cernovich, one of the leading voices in the debunked \"Pizzagate' conspiracy theory. Cernovich popularized its new hashtag--#SyriaHoax--and sent it soaring through cyberspace. According to Trends24, within hours of the retaliatory missile strike President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> launched on Thursday night, #SyriaHoax was the No. 1 trending Twitter topic in the United States. J.M. Berger of The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism at The Hague, who studies propaganda and social media analytical techniques, said #SyriaHoax is\" a clear example of a Russian influence campaign \"designed to undermine the credibility of the U.S. government .\" The point of an influence campaign is to get people involved who wouldn't otherwise be involved, \"Berger said .\" A lot of people in the alt-right would not necessarily characterize themselves as being pro-Russian, but they're receiving influence from this campaign. \"Berger cannot say whether Al-Masdar News is backed by either the Syrian government or the Russian government, only that the outlet\" is being promoted at an extraordinary level by this [Russian] network \"and the Kremlin has a history of weaponizing disinformation .\" This is a new iteration of an old type of warfare, \"Berger said .\" We saw the Soviet Union use tactics like this during the Cold War. The difference is that you can do it on an industrial scale at a very low cost without deploying actual operatives on the ground of a foreign country. \"This latest social media coup comes just months after Russia's attempts to use similar tactics to meddle with the U.S. presidential election, which U.S. officials believe was undertaken by a secretive Russian intelligence operation based in St. Petersberg tasked with manipulating public opinion. Senator <mark>Mark Warner</mark>, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating those efforts, says a close examination of the evidence so far reveals a disturbing timeline running throughout the campaign. WikiLeak's release of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Russian-hacked emails--just 29 minutes after The Washington Postpublished an explosive video showing <mark>Donald Trump</mark> making sexually explicit comments during an Access Hollywood shoot--raised particular concerns .\" That was more than coincidence, \"<mark>Warner</mark> said .\" It is so outrageous that a foreign nation came in and manipulated our news, hacked into personal information leaked it out on a selective basis. \"According to Ciaran Martin, the head of a newly created national cybersecurity operation at Britain's GCHQ, which provided U.S. officials with the first indication that the Russians had hacked the Democratic Party, activity like this hasn't slowed down since the presidential election in November. It's actually on the rise .\" I think we've seen a significant increase in Russian aggression in cyberspace over the past two years, \"Martin said .\" We see attacks from state actors on a very frequent basis...It has not plateaued. It is continuing to increase. \"<mark>John Carlin</mark>, the former assistant attorney general for national security and an ABC News consultant, said the U.S. has less than four years to find a way to protect its election process .\" They're going to come after us again in 2020, \"<mark>Carlin</mark> said .\" If anything it may be more severe...They're probably going to come back with more skill, more desire to cause impact, and between now and then, we need to make sure they don't succeed. \"Copyright \u00a9 2017, ABC Radio.

Presentations will be held April 18 in Burlington and April 20 in Rutland, and a webinar hosted by the Vermont Medical Society will take place on May 17. The sessions are designed to educate the state's health care providers and prescribers about the requirements and public health policy for appropriate prescribing of opioids in treating acute pain. The new rules are scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2017. The revision to the existing prescribing rules are intended to minimize opportunities for misuse, abuse, diversion, addiction and overdoses, by flipping the presumption that a patient needs opioids to manage pain, and by addressing appropriate quantities for initial prescriptions. \"These rules are a critical part of our efforts to create conditions where we can prevent opioid addiction from starting,\" said Health Commissioner <mark>Mark Levine</mark>, MD.. To bridge the varying prescribing practices and philosophies among Vermont's prescribers, the rules set new \"defaults' for prescribing for pain, and requires that doctors assess non-opioid and non-pharmacological treatments before opioids are prescribed. Providers will also continue to engage patients in their own treatment decisions, through education concerning the risks associated with taking opioids, safe storage and appropriate disposal of opioids. Dr. <mark>Levine</mark> said the new rules were approved by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules following an extensive process that included 19 meetings and a public hearing with patients, physicians, pharmacists, dentists, and other stakeholders.

When Prince died of an accidental painkiller overdose, members of The Revolution were mourning at a Minneapolis hotel and made an impromptu video, promising to reunite for shows honoring their one-time flamboyant front man. After three sold-out shows at the fabled First Avenue nightclub (the setting of Prince's hit 1984 movie \"Purple Rain\" ) in September, The Revolution is back, preparing to kick off a tour Friday at Paisley Park in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen on the anniversary of Prince's death. The tour includes stops in Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco before ending in Seattle on July 15. Melvoin is joined by bassist BrownMark, keyboardists Matt Fink and <mark>Lisa Coleman</mark>, and drummer Bobby Z. The reunited Revolution plans to play Prince's synthesizer-heavy 1980s music through his lauded 1987 double album \"Sign o' the Times .\" \"We have the ability now to give people a glimpse of what we experienced with him,\" BrownMark said. \"And I think that's a powerful thing. I know it helped me heal .\" While Prince had a reputation as a perfectionist, members of The Revolution remember the good times goofing in the studio. \"We had fun. We had a lot of fun. Sometimes we would be rehearsing and we'd crack up, we'd just laugh for an hour, cracking jokes,\" BrownMark recalls. \"We'd go play softball,\" keyboardist Fink said. \"\"OK, we're not going to rehearse today, let's go play softball .'\" After years of recording and touring with The Revolution, Prince \"did what any boss would do and just put it (the band) to bed,\" Bobby Z. said. \"That intense run we had, all those years, it was starting to come apart at the seams, with personalities and under that kind of pressure, just like human beings do, and he just kind of made a decision,\" the drummer said. \"And he wanted to move on as basically a solo artist with a backing band, no disrespect. But this was a band he was a very critical member of .\" Whether The Revolution will continue beyond this tour is an open question. \"We'd love to be able to see if there are some legs with this,\" Melvoin said. ___ Follow Jeff Baenen on Twitter at https: //twitter.com/jeffbaenen.
