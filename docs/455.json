Now, youth soccer players in the Bay Area have a new alternative: soccer fields that anyone can use for a low price. New Pinellas Park soccer fields open to all at a low price BT Sports Academy on 49th Street More info on BT Sports Academy Bruce To invested his own money to build new soccer fields in Pinellas Park. He wants them open to everyone. \"I've come across a lot of kids who couldn't afford to play, especially travel clubs,\" To said. He and volunteers cleared out a junkyard on 49th Street, turning it into BT Sports Academy. It's a place where anyone can play a pickup game of soccer. \"Our goal is to have a place where kids, or adults even, can come play the game and not have to worry about being asked to leave,\" To said. The fields are a hit. They consistently fill up with parents and some smaller leagues who can't pay thousands for a soccer club. \"We want parents to be able to get good coaching without paying an arm and a leg for it,\" said parent and soccer coach <mark>Matthew Young</mark>. To has plans to build even more, including some indoor fields and even a restaurant. It's part of a lifelong dream to see no child turned away from a game. \"Every time I watch kids, dads, moms playing, kids versus coach, it's a great feeling,\" To said. BT Sports Academy does charge a small fee, sometimes as low as $5 for a pickup game. To says that is lower than what many public parks charge. Plus, To says many public parks are usually occupied by bigger leagues.

Clients will be able to shoot hoops and play video games. Basketball, coffee and clipper cuts. All is on offer at Christchurch's biggest and most unique barber. Maximising its cult-like following, Benny's Barber Shop has opened its new 300-square-metre headquarters in an old glazing warehouse on Orbell St in Sydenham. JOSEPH JOHNSON/STUFF Benny's Barber Shop owner <mark>Ben Scott</mark> plays a computer arcade game at his new premises. Owner <mark>Ben Scott</mark> said it would become the company's main premises; its existing barbershops literally moved in under the high ceilings.

The barber's own clothing line was for sale in a small retail space next to a barista coffee bar.

He was already cutting his mates' hair and decided to hone his skills at barber school in Auckland. Using his building skills, <mark>Scott</mark> fitted out a campervan and operated from his parents' Burnside property. He built a following, helped in no small way by slick haircuts for All Blacks and other rugby stars, photos of which were posted to social media. \"That first year for me was stupid hours really, like, 8am till 10pm. I just kept going,\" he said. The business has since expanded. Now 3 years old, the company employs 12 staff and operates a space in Hallensteins' Christchurch store. Another is opening in the Wellington store, on Lambton Quay, in July. \"If that goes well they want to look at Auckland too, so that's a big move, but definitely exciting .\" I'm hoping it continues to expand really, so we'll open this and rip into that, start a second clothing line, do some more marketing and potentially tap into some hair product ranges, \"he said. - Stuff Saved | Saved Stories Saved | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Save | Saved Stories Next Business story: Lincoln: From mill town to boom town The Press Homepage Comments", "articleID": "2018050603_00162144_W", "names": {"Ben Scott": ["Q15078073", "Q27839151", "Q4886426", "Q4886429"]}}, {"date": "2018-05-08", "url": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/scandal-protesting-stars-and-bans-as-cannes-festival-opens/article/521616", "content": "Scandal, protesting stars and bans as Cannes festival opens Listen | Print By Fiachra GIBBONS (AFP) 5 mins ago in World The most political Cannes film festival in years opens Tuesday with female stars vowing to protest on the red carpet, two top directors barred from attending and bans hanging over other movies. With the industry still reeling from the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and Cannes under fire for its dearth of women directors, Cate Blanchett and Kristen Stewart are likely to join actresses and women directors Saturday in a protest in support of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The new \"Star Wars\" spin-off, \"Solo\" , is the only Hollywood blockbuster in a slightly less starry line-up than usual. But with no less than a dozen films with LGBT themes, and others tackling child abuse, male prostitution and an eye-watering DIY sex change, it has all the makings of a vintage year for scandal and controversy. A new documentary about the tragic singer Whitney Houston by Oscar winner <mark>Kevin Macdonald</mark> reportedly includes a devastating revelation about the demons that dogged her short life. \"Black Panther\" director Ryan Coogler--whose film is breaking box office records--is also likely to tackle the lack of black faces in Hollywood in a Cannes masterclass. - Lesbian film banned - Australian actress Cate Blanchett heads this year's Cannes jury Alberto PIZZOLI, AFP With Monty Python's Terry Gilliam fighting in the French courts to have his disaster-plagued \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" shown, the first Kenyan movie to be selected for the world's top festival has already been banned in its homeland for daring to depict a lesbian romance. Despite a plea by US director Oliver Stone, Tehran has refused to lift a travel ban on Iranian master Jafar Panahi, whose \"Three Faces\" is in the running for the top Palme d'Or prize. The dissident director made it clandestinely after being banned from making films for 20 years for his activism after the \"stolen election\" of 2009. Appeals to bail Russia's Kirill Serebrennikov, under house arrest in Moscow on embezzlement charges his supporters claim are political, have also fallen on deaf ears. Festival director Thierry Fremaux told reporters Monday that it was ironic that both Iran and Russia should be \"punishing the directors when neither film is political\". Serious doubts also hang over whether Gilliam's Pythonesque movie will be allowed to close the festival after it became embroiled in a bitter legal battle over who owns the rights. Judges in Paris will decide Wednesday whether the film, which Gilliam has laboured on for nearly two decades, can be shown. - \"Problem with women' - But it is Cannes'\" dismal \"record on female directors, and Saturday's red carpet protest led by A-list stars, which may generate the most political heat. Long before Weinstein had been accused of attacking four women at the festival, Cannes had been under fire for a\" problem with women \". Women have been stopped on the red carpet in previous years for not wearing high heels, and its dress code has been condemned as sexist. But the Weinstein scandal has given its critics further ammunition, with screenwriter <mark>Kate Muir</mark> of Women and Hollywood lacerating the festival as\" a two-week celebration of male brains and female beauty \". The 71st Cannes film festival Simon MALFATTO, AFP The fact that only three out of 21 directors in the running for the top prize are women--the same number as last year--has also rankled. While admitting that Cannes\" will never be the same again \"after the Weinstein scandal, Fremaux said he was against quotas. Instead he put Hollywood star Blanchett--one of the first to call out Weinstein--at the head a majority-female jury alongside another of Weinstein's victims, French\" Bond \"actress Lea Seydoux. But Fremaux's surprise decision to lift the festival's seven-year ban on Danish director Lars von Trier has stoked feminist ire. The ageing provocateur has been accused of sexual harassment by the singer Bjork, and his production company has been hit by multiple similar claims. Von Trier sparked outrage during a 2011 Cannes press conference by saying that he was a Nazi who understood Hitler and sympathised\" with him a little bit \". But Michel Hazanavicius, the Oscar-winning director of\" The Artist \", who is on the festival's board, insisted von Trier was joking, while Fremaux said Monday that the Dane was not an anti-Semite. Pointedly, however, he has not risked giving von Trier a press conference this time for his new serial killer flick,\" The House That Jack Built \"with Uma Thurman and <mark>Matt Dillon</mark>. Hazanavicius said the veteran Swiss-French director <mark>Jean-Luc Godard</mark>, whose latest film is also at Cannes, has also said\" much worse things than Lars von Trier on this very same topic \". But that\" doesn't mean we have to condemn them \"as artists, he added. The festival runs for two weeks and is considered the world's most prestigious film awards LOIC VENANCE, AFP\" It's very difficult for people to accept the idea that you can be a jerk in your personal life and a great artist. \"", "articleID": "2018050801_00146971_W", "names": {"Jean-Luc Godard": ["Q3167159", "Q53001"], "Kate Muir": ["Q58403926", "Q6375675"], "Kevin Macdonald": ["Q1344373", "Q52018728", "Q614111", "Q6396823"], "Matt Dillon": ["Q193070", "Q6788561", "Q93062"]}}, {"date": "2018-05-14", "url": "http://www.fox46charlotte.com/home/getting-results/memorial-honors-us-army-soliders-father-buried-on-family-farm", "content": "Image Gallery 2 PHOTOS MONROE, NC (FOX 46 WJZY) - A young military couple in Monroe was honored for their service this weekend. Purple Heart Homes created a memorial for the woman's dad who served in the Special Forces. \"He was totally supportive of me joining the military,\" Leah Schumacher said. Schumacher joined the U.S. Army when she was 22. Her dad was Special Forces and served in Vietnam. \"I had heard stories about him being a Green Berets, but I didn't really fully grasp the gravity of that,\" Schumacher said. Their bond as father and daughter strengthened as fellow soldiers. Leah deployed to Iraq in 2003. \"I called my father from Germany. Of course I was sobbing. He said,\" Sweet girl, the Lord is going to protect you in Iraq just like he protected me in Vietnam .' And he was right, \"Schumacher said. She's the first woman in her family to join the military .\" Being the first in your family to do something I think is already pretty special. Then being the first female in your family to serve your country is pretty special as well, \"Schumacher said. Fast-forward a few years, Leah met her husband Jason, also an Army veteran. They have two little boys Gavin and Bryce and live in Monroe where Leah grew up .\" I lived here for 22 years before I joined the Army. I joined the Army in 2003. When I got out and after my husband and I both met, my parents vacated the property and we moved in. It's been a huge blessing to live where I grew up. \"Her childhood home needed some time, love, and care.

Many of the people helping paint, plant, and weed are colleagues from MSC Industrial Supplies in Davidson. Her job is special. Leah explains .\" March 31st of last year, my father passed away from Agent Orange-related diabetes. He died unexpectedly. One of his final wishes is that he be buried here on our property, \"Schumacher said. <mark>Rebecca</mark> and her colleagues created a space that honors both Leah and her father William C. Sganga .\" He received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Metal for Valor for saving other people's lives on the battlefield, \"Schumacher said. <mark>Rebecca</mark>'s dad also died from an Agent Orange related illness. He was a Marine .\" My father was a Vietnam vet and that is dear to my heart. To be able to work on the grave-site was very endearing, \"she said. At the end of the day, everyone took a tour of their handiwork. Leah's husband Jason thanked Purple Heart Homes and MSC. Jason was injured in Iraq so even small tasks, he says, are a big help .\" A lot of it may have seemed small jobs or whatever. It's a tremendous help to us. It all adds up. Even pulling weeds wears me out on a normal basis. Don't think you didn't make a big difference today. In my mind you sure did, \"Jason said. A big difference that honored these two young veterans and the man who inspired Leah to serve her country .\" This is so awesome you all. This is so awesome, \"Leah said .\" Your dad would be proud, \"Jason said .\" He would. He would be very proud, \"Leah said.
