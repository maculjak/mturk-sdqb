Spencer Platt/Getty Images New Jersey Gov. <mark>Phil Murphy</mark> is starting his tenure with a better job approval rating than his two predecessors, but many residents know little or nothing about his budget proposal, according to a new poll released on Wednesday. A Monmouth University poll found that 44 percent of New Jersey adults like the job <mark>Murphy</mark> is doing, compared to 28 percent who disapprove and 28 percent who don't have an opinion. <mark>Murphy</mark>'s net positive job rating is a departure from his two predecessors, who had slightly negative ratings at the same point in their terms. Chris Christie held a 41 percent approval rating and a 44 percent disapprove rating in April 2010. Jon Corzine had a 34 percent approval rating and a 37 percent disapproval rating in April 2006. Many New Jerseyans are still unfamiliar with <mark>Murphy</mark>'s $37.4 billion budget, which includes $1.7 billion in tax increases. Just 15 percent said they have heard a lot about the spending plan, compared to 55 percent who've heard little and 30 percent who know nothing about it. By contrast, more residents knew a lot about the first budgets submitted by Christie (45 percent) and Corzine (25 percent). Only nine percent are satisfied with <mark>Murphy</mark>'s budget proposal, while 29 percent said they can live with it and 23 percent are dissatisfied. Nearly four in 10 (38 percent) have no opinion or haven't heard about the plan, according to the poll. \"Perhaps one reason why <mark>Murphy</mark>'s overall job rating is so positive is because fewer New Jerseyans are paying attention to this new governor than in the past,\" <mark>Patrick Murray</mark>, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. \"It's worth noting that turnout in last year's election was a record low, and Monmouth's polling found that most voters couldn't say whether <mark>Murphy</mark>'s views were in line with the state. It's not clear how much more they know now.\" Residents are split on whether <mark>Murphy</mark> cares more about governing New Jersey (40 percent) or is more concerned about his political future (39 percent). That's more positive than what residents said about Christie, who left office with 79 percent of New Jerseyans believing he put personal ambition over the state. The poll of 703 New Jersey adults was conducted from April 6 to April 10.

The diocese filed for bankruptcy in 2004. It reached an agreement in 2007 to pay people who claimed abuse at the hands of priests dating back decades. Former Spokane Bishop Blase Cupich, who now serves as archbishop of Chicago, reviewed the bankruptcy case when he arrived in 2010 and decided to pursue a claim against the law firm. The church had sought $3.6 million in legal fees from the law firm, saying its lawyers underestimated how many victims would come forward with sex abuse claims after the bankruptcy was first resolved. The law firm had disputed the claim. A $1 million fund was created to handle future claims after the bankruptcy case was first resolved, based on Paine Hamblen's estimates of how much it would cost the diocese to settle the allegations. But the fund was quickly depleted, raising the prospect of foreclosure on some Catholic parishes that had been put up as collateral. Paine Hamblen disputed the malpractice claims by pointing to the vitality of the Catholic Church in Spokane following the $48 million bankruptcy settlement.

In a move that has significantly enhanced the meeting and conferencing experience of its corporate customers, the Sheraton Kuwait has upgraded to the latest wireless conferencing system from Sennheiser. Implemented across the property's two large ballroom-style conference facilities as well as its many meeting rooms of varied sizes, the audio specialist's ADN-W system delivers crystal clear audio conferencing with the convenience of flexible and secure wireless connectivity. Intuitiveness and customer satisfaction were top of mind for the five-star hotel. \"Our hotel's world-class facilities meet the needs of very large to extremely intimate gatherings and the wireless conferencing system allows the equipment to also be\" right-sized' exactly as per customer requirements, \"said engineer Mohamed Monieb, maintenance manager at the Sheraton Kuwait. Especially beneficial for Monieb and his team has been the system's ability to eliminate the RF interference issues that plagued the microphone system they had previously utilised.\" Prior to selecting Sennheiser, we conducted a test between ADN-W, our existing system and another manufacturer's solution and this not only demonstrated vastly superior sound quality, but also convincingly addressed our concerns around interference, \"he said. It is the ADN-W's ability to hop between frequencies in the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz ranges that makes this performance possible. Robust and reliable wireless connectivity was also assured through the direct involvement of Sennheiser's team in the design and deployment of the antennas and central control units. <mark>Ryan Burr</mark>, head of technical sales and application engineering in System Solutions at Sennheiser Middle East, commented:\" The requirement from the Sheraton was quite complex as they wanted to be able to use the system in multiple rooms throughout their premises. Through meticulous planning and modelling, we settled on permanently locating the antennas and control units in three of the rooms and then providing a floating system with accompanying wireless microphone units that can be easily moved between meeting rooms as required. \"As a simple\" plug-n-play' solution, ADN-W offers instant ease of use and is preloaded with powerful software that Sennheiser regularly updates for continuous improvement and extension of its state-of-the-art features. Conference participants can intuitively control ADN-W from the integrated PC simply by attaching a monitor and keyboard, or with a third-party media control system. The system also offers two USB ports that enable recording of conference audio onto connected drives or memory sticks. Sennheiser, working together with its long-standing partner and distributor in Kuwait, aDawliah Electronics, commissioned the system and on the day the installation was completed, the Sheraton utilised the system for a high-profile event attended by ministers of trade and industry from across the Arabian region. \"We have received very positive feedback from these as well as other clients who have been very satisfied using the new system,\" said Monieb. The following Sennheiser solutions have been deployed at the Sheraton Kuwait: 2 x ADN CU1 Central Unit 8 x ADN-W AM Antenna Module 2 x ADN-W C1 Chairman Unit 60 x ADN-W D1 Delegate Unit 62 x ADN-W MIC 15-50 50cm (long) gooseneck Full Charging and Transport Case solution to make the system completely portable. sennheiser 2019-01-08 Guy Campos Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Email"}, {"articleID": "2019123020_00098735_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2019-12-30", "url": "https://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/depressed-greta-stopped-talking/3911861/", "content": "Greta Thunberg was deeply \"depressed\" and had \"stopped talking and eating\" before her life changed due to climate change activism. Environment Greta Thunberg suffered from depression by Patrick Knox 31st Dec 2019 6:06 AM 0 Greta Thunberg had \"stopped talking and eating\" before climate activism \"saved her\" , according to her dad. Svante Thunberg said he thought depression would kill his daughter before she launched her worldwide \"climate crisis\" campaign. He also said he thought it was a \"bad idea\" for his daughter, 16, to take the \"front line\" in combating climate change, The Sun. Mr Thunberg's remarks to the BBC came during a special edition of the Radio 4 Today program guest-edited by Greta. In an interview he said of her climate change activism: \"We thought it was a bad idea, just the idea of your own daughter sort of putting herself at the very front line of such a huge question like climate change.\" You wouldn't want that as a parent. \"Greta Thunberg stares down US President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> as he enters the United Nations on September 23, 2019. He said they spoke several times with Greta before she pursued her campaigning, explaining that she would have to do it by herself and be well prepared for questions she would face - praising her response. Mr Thunberg also talked about the difficulties that his daughter, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, experienced with depression. Asked how she got better, he said:\" We just took a very, very long time to spend a lot of time together and just work it out together. \"He said Greta thought her parents were\" huge hypocrites \"because they were active advocates for refugees, noting that his daughter would ask\" whose human rights are you standing up? \"Mr Thunberg said his wife stopped flying and had to\" change her whole career \". He added:\" To be honest, she didn't do it save the climate - she did it to save her child because she saw how much it meant to her, and then, when she did that, she saw how much she grew from that, how much energy she got from it. \"He said he\" became vegan \"and Greta\" got more and more energy \"from this.\" I knew they were the right things to do because I understood the facts at that time, but I didn't do it to save the climate, I did it to save my child, \"he said. Environmental activist Greta Thunberg finds the trolls\" hilarious \". Picture: AP/Jason DeCrow) Svante Thunberg has lifted the lid on how he feels about his daughter's work. Picture: BBC\" HATE?...SHE FINDS IT HILARIOUS' On the abuse the teenager faces, Mr Thunberg said: \"The hate, quite frankly, I don't know how she does it but she laughs most of the time, she finds it hilarious.\" Greta, who has become a global icon for her activism, has been repeatedly trolled. In October Piers Morgan sparked outrage on Good Morning Britain today after impersonating her. The outspoken presenter was slamming civil disobedience group Extinction Rebellion when he launched a bizarre imitation of the 16-year-old climate activist. \"How dare you, how dare you?\" Morgan said, mocking Greta, who has Asperger's. \"You have stolen my morning, you have stolen my airtime. I have no life. How dare you?\" Morgan, 54, was using some of the Swedish activist's rhetoric from an impassioned speech at the UN Climate Action Summit earlier this year, when she accused those present - including <mark>Donald Trump</mark> - of \"stealing my dreams, my childhood\" . But <mark>Trump</mark>, who Greta famously glared at during a UN summit, called her a \"very happy young girl looking forward to a bright future\" . Later he retweeted one of his supporters who branded the teen an actress. Russian leader Vladimir Putin also took aim at the teenager branding her \"poorly informed\" and saying she was \"telling developing countries they should keep living in poverty\" . Meanwhile a private school head teacher cruelly branded Greta \"a little girl with mental problems\" in a newsletter sent to parents. Rodney Lynn, the principal of Coffs Harbour Christian Community Primary School in New South Wales, Australia, has been slammed for his comments about the climate activist. He accused the Swede of promoting \"doomsday waffle talk\" and labelled her a \"false prophet\" in the letter sent out to students and parents. But despite her detractors, Greta has been recognised for her devotion to fighting climate change. Earlier this month she was named Time magazine's youngest ever person of the year. Greta, who turns 17 in January, was awarded the recognition as she stood on a box to make a speech at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She accused politicians and businessmen of using \"creative PR\" to duck their responsibilities and \"not behaving as if we are in an emergency\" . She stormed: \"The biggest danger is not inaction; the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.\" This story was originally published in The Sun and is reprinted with permission. 0 climate change Read More Login to follow depression Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow greta thunberg Read More Login to follow health Read More Login to follow climate change depression editors picks greta thunberg health"}, {"articleID": "2016050515_00003038_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"], "Manmohan Singh": ["Q17019633", "Q41914", "Q47205876"]}, "date": "2016-05-06", "url": "http://thediplomat.com/2016/05/trump-or-clinton-does-it-matter-to-india/", "content": "<mark>Trump</mark> or Clinton: Does It Matter to India? Should New Delhi expect a major change in U.S. policy? By Tridivesh Singh Maini for The Diplomat May 05, 2016 0 Shares Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the U.S. in June, where he will address Congress at the invitation of Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark>. Modi will be the fifth Indian prime minister to address that body, following Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and <mark>Manmohan Singh</mark>. It will also be Modi's fourth visit to the U.S. in two years. Since his election, Modi has strengthened India's strategic partnership with the U.S., while also seeking to enhance economic ties, much to the surprise of some pundits who had no hesitation predicting that he would focus more on Asia, while preferring a transactional relationship with Washington. Instead, Modi has taken some significant steps to reach out to the U.S., perhaps most notably his decision to invite U.S. President Barack Obama as chief guest at the 2015 Republic Day Parade. What clearly emerges is that the bilateral relationship has been \"institutionalized\" in the strategic sphere, with a number of convergences, especially in the context of issues like the South China Sea dispute. Both countries have also \"in principle\" signed the Logistics Support Agreement, which will deepen defense cooperation. A number of strategic analysts in India argue that a Republican in the White House would be better for India than a Democrat would be. If one were to look at the primaries, India has found mention a few times. While the candidate set to win the Republican nomination, <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, first mentioned India in the context of taking away U.S. jobs and also imitated an Indian call center worker, he also recently spoke about using India to stabilize Pakistan. Strategic analysts in India who are skeptical about a Democrat president have naturally taken note of <mark>Trump</mark>'s remarks, arguing that Hillary Clinton--the likely Democrat nominee--will be much softer on Pakistan. A number of points need to be kept in mind when looking at the bilateral relationship. In the strategic sphere, ties have moved beyond personalities and parties. Few would have thought that Modi would have visited America four times in two years. It would have also been unimaginable to think that a Congress prime minister would invest so much in the India-U.S. relationship as <mark>Manmohan Singh</mark> did, although a recalcitrant opposition and sections of the old guard in his own party did not support his initiatives. Second, while it is true that the relationship witnessed a high during the tenure of a Republican president, namely President George W Bush, the foundations for a strong relationship were laid by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Just a few month's after India's nuclear tests--which prompted condemnation from Washington--then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke about the affinities between the countries, especially their democratic credentials. This was followed by a visit to India by Clinton in March 2000 and a visit to the U.S. by Vajpayee in September 2000. Meanwhile, Obama, a Democrat, is the only U.S. president to have visited India twice, and has not adhered to the traditional practice of visiting Pakistan afterwards. During his second term, the U.S. president has also sought to find common ground with India on the South China Sea issue. In the economic sphere, the relationship is transactional. Much will depend on India's economic performance and whether it can initiate what are often called \"big-bang\" reforms, one of them being the GST. During his address to the U.S.-India Business Council in his January 2015 visit, Obama noted that America's trade with China far outstrips that with India. \"We are moving in the right direction...That said, we also know that the U.S.-India relationship is defined by so much untapped potential,\" Obama said. \"Every one here will agree, we've got to do better.\" Even <mark>Trump</mark> has spoken about the close relationship between China and U.S. in the economic sphere, although he has taken a tougher line on strategic issues. Indeed, in the economic sphere, India will need to address the concerns of U.S. investors, especially with regard to red tape--and not just in New Delhi, but in its states as well. So it would be fair to say that the India-U.S. relationship is very likely to strengthen in the strategic sphere, irrespective of which party takes power in Washington. The only issue on which there could be a divergence with a future regime could be Iran, an important strategic partner for India. Even Hillary Clinton is likely to take a very different approach to Iran than Obama's bold and imaginative policy.

Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times A collage of female voices--including those of Michelle Obama and Barbara Walters--greets the audience arriving at Robert O\u2019Hara's new play, \"Mankind.\" Listen carefully, because that's the last you'll hear from anyone but men in the daring, daunting comedy, which opened at Playwrights Horizons on Monday evening. In Mr. O\u2019Hara's not-too-distant future, women have gone extinct. Exactly how this happened is not clear, but a combination of environmental insults and anatomical over-regulation seems to have made women give up on the project of feminism--and the fact of femaleness--in a universal #NotMe moment. And though men quickly evolved to replace their procreative capacity, even the universal homosexuality that resulted has not made the survivors any less male. They still screw everything up. The plot takes that notion literally at first, as Jason (Bobby Moreno) announces to Mark (Anson Mount), with whom he's had a series of casual hookups, some bad news: \"Dude, I'm pregnant.\" You may wish to know how, but neither Mr. O\u2019Hara nor the characters seem clear on that point. (Both Jason and Mark, we learn, were on the pill .) In any case, the mutual recrimination over how the pregnancy happened soon resolves itself in an agreement to \"get rid of it\" --the baby, that is. Continue reading the main story Not so fast. In a reversal of the joke that if men gave birth, abortion would be a sacrament, the Big Brother-ish World Power Authority still outlaws pregnancy termination. After his OB-GYN rats him out, Jason is forced to deliver the \"Cry-Baby\" growing inside him by means of a machine that looks like an M.R.I. scanner crossed with a Keurig. But the child, which pops out pre-swaddled, is not what anyone expected. Photo Mr. Mount and Mr. Moreno are a couple having a baby, and <mark>David Ryan</mark> Smith, far right, is their OB-GYN in Robert O\u2019Hara's play. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times I won't spoil that part of the busy plot by saying more about the Cry-Baby, except that it somehow becomes, in this full-out patriarchy, the centerpiece of a new feminist religion. By intermission, Jason and Mark are that religion's unwilling high priests, wearing glittery robes and Ziegfeld headgear (by Dede M. Ayite) that would make a cardinal--the bird or the prelate--blush. You may blush, too, if you are a man who does not relish audience participation, as you will be asked to raise your voice in hymn to the \"most merciful Goddess.\" (Women aren't given the prayer cards .) Unfortunately, the development of this woman-and-baby-worshiping cult hijacks what seemed to be a topical comedy of gender roles and drags it around for most of the second act. Religious ideology and professions of faith, especially Catholic ones, are lampooned as idiotic and venal, but the satire will likely infuriate traditional believers of any stripe. The first of the new Ten Commandments is \"Abortion is a human right.\" I wasn't bothered by that: Surely religion is fair game for mockery. And no one should go to a Robert O\u2019Hara play who isn't up for some trampling of sensitivities. Deliberate outrageousness is his m\u00e9tier, but he's an equal opportunity purveyor, eager to rile stray conservatives who venture into the theater, as well as their liberal antagonists.

In \"Barbecue,\" seen at the Public Theater in 2015, he let the audience laugh at the down-market doings of a black family picnic before repeating the scene, verbatim, with a white family. In \"Bootycandy,\" an earlier satire of black theatrical tropes and the white people who love them, a stand-in character for the playwright tells audience members at a postshow talk back that he hopes they will \"choke\" trying to swallow what he's written. \"The work should be work,\" he says. But at their intermittent best those plays were so hilarious that the work was not work--or if work, then the highly pleasurable kind. Each had a defining gimmick that made it deliciously theatrical: a twist, Mr. O\u2019Hara writes in a program note, \"that gives the play its Shout.\" So does \"Mankind,\" in its triumph-of-the-patriarchy premise. The problem here is that the story keeps twisting even when you need it to stay put and shout. Another switcheroo arrives every few minutes, which quickly grows as tiresome as a joker roommate and lets the satire deflate into mere sarcasm. It's a problem of focus. Satire is about the sharpness of the darts but also of the targets. Here there are too many targets to leave a coherent impression. Religion seems to be the intended bull's - eye, and it's certainly instructive to see how the church of \"She\" (whose name is thought to be unpronounceable) grows into a grotesque expression of mansplained feminism. So is the way casual, catty utterances of Jason and Mark are misinterpreted by apostles and transformed into dogma. Mr. O\u2019Hara also asks you to cackle about the vapidity of talk shows, the clich\u00e9s of dystopian dialogue, bromosexuality, sexism, Trumpism and futurism itself. This pinwheel of snark feels like a stunt, and there's little that the cast--which also includes <mark>David Ryan</mark> Smith, Ariel Shafir, Stephen Schnetzer and Andr\u00e9 De Shields--can do, under the author's seemingly distracted direction, to keep a feeling of agitated desperation at bay. Their varying choices to play the material as serious drama or sketch comedy seem almost random. Mr. O\u2019Hara has said that with satire, especially now, you can't go partway: \"You have to go for the throat.\" That's probably true--and the viciousness of \"Mankind\" that would offend some people is perhaps its best quality. But when you go for too many throats at once, the result feels less like comedy than mayhem, and hasn't the patriarchy already shown us enough of that?
