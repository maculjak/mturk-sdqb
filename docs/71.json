Jacklyn Davis, a spokeswoman for Anne Arundel County police, said the letters were received Monday. They were mailed to an attorney for The Capital newspaper, a retired judge of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals and a Baltimore judge. The letter Ramos sent to the Annapolis newspaper's Baltimore-based lawyer was written to resemble a legal motion for reconsideration of his unsuccessful 2012 defamation lawsuit against the paper, a columnist and then-publisher Tom Marquardt. Marquardt shared a copy of the letter with The Associated Press. \"If this is how the Maryland Judiciary operates, the law now means nothing,\" Ramos wrote. He quoted a description of the purpose of a defamation suit, saying it was intended for a defamed person to \"resort to the courts for relief instead of wreaking his own vengeance.\" \"\"That' is how your judiciary operates, you were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,\" Ramos wrote. He signed it under the chilling statement: \"I told you so.\" Below that, he wrote that he was going to the newspaper's office \"with the objective of killing every person present.\" In a letter attached to what appeared to be the faux court filing, he also directly addressed retired special appeals court Judge Charles Moylan, who decided against Ramos in his defamation case. Ramos sued the paper after pleading guilty to harassing a high school classmate. \"Welcome, Mr. Moylan, to your unexpected legacy: YOU should have died,\" he wrote. He signed it: \"Friends forever, Jarrod W. Ramos.\" Douglas Colbert, a University of Maryland law professor, described the letters as \"very powerful\" evidence of intent that the state will make full use of at trial. Colbert said as long as it's established in court that Ramos authored the letters, they will be used to show his \"planning and deliberate actions\" on the day of the attack. The apparent admissions by the defendant will weaken a defense lawyer's strategy of suggesting that he was \"suffering from a mental disease or defect\" that would impair his ability to understand the consequences of his actions, Colbert said. Ramos, 38, has a well-documented history of harassing the paper's journalists. The defamation suit was thrown out as groundless, and he often railed against current and former Capital staff in profanity-laced tweets. Police found him hiding under a desk after Thursday's attack and jailed him on five counts of first-degree murder. At a memorial service Monday night for one of those killed, editor Rob Hiassen, Marquardt said he once slept with a baseball bat by his bed because he was so worried about Ramos. He also said that they \"stepped up security\" at the newspaper years ago, and posted Ramos's photo around the office. \"But then he went dormant for about two years and we thought the problem has been solved. Apparently, it was just building up steam,\" he said. The mourning in Annapolis continued Tuesday, marked by a lowering of U.S. flags to honor the victims. President Donald Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff on federal property through sunset. Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley said Monday that Trump, who has repeatedly called journalists the \"enemy of the people,\" said he had been told his request to lower the flags had been denied. The White House said Tuesday that Trump ordered the flags lowered as soon as he learned of the mayor's request. Buckley expressed frustration Monday afternoon when he was told by a Maryland congressman's office the request had not been granted. He said he considered lowering flags on his own, but decided to follow protocol. He said he received a call from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders just after 11 p.m. Monday, asking him for confirmation if he personally was making the request. \"She was very sympathetic,\" Buckley said in an interview. \"She felt for our community. She said\" I'll get back to you in the morning,' and she called me 7:16 this morning to say the president had issued a proclamation, and we're very grateful for that. \"Hiaasen was remembered Monday evening in stories, poems, prayers and songs at the\" celebration of life \"ceremony Monday evening. He was fatally shot last week at the Capital Gazette along with colleagues Gerald Fischman, <mark>John McNamara</mark>, <mark>Rebecca Smith</mark> and Wendi Winters. ___"}, {"articleID": "2016071919_00818371_W", "names": {"James Cameron": ["Q42574", "Q56928032", "Q6130910", "Q6130912"]}, "date": "2016-07-19", "url": "http://atimes.com/2016/07/travel-hallelujah-mountains-on-earth/", "content": "Travel In all probity, you have watched the blockbuster \"Avatar\" once, if not multiple times.

Durham and Kotsay's were worse, because they came against Oakland in the playoffs. \"He hit it, line drive in the lights,\" Hunter said. \"And it stayed in the lights. If it's on a line it is going to stay in there. All I could do is make the adjustment, jump as high as I could on the run. But, that was hit hard.\" ROSTER NEEDS WORK: What are the Twins going to do about their DH spot? Eduardo Nunez was 1-for-4 on Friday, but this lineup could use some pop, and there's a speed bump after Trevor Plouffe bats. Kennys Vargas apparently is just doing OK at Rochester and Josmil Pinto has tailed off after a hot start. It has forced the manager to come up with some eye-popping lineups. \"It's been challenging,\" Twins manager <mark>Paul Molitor</mark> said. \"It is kind of where we are at right now, especially with our hand being forced to use our bullpen tomorrow we need depth. We are a little limited on the bench, so we have have to rendez-vous through the DH and the middle of the lineup for now. We're looking for people to come up and help us but I don't think anyone is jumping out at us right now.\" TOMORROW!!!: The Twins need a solid start from J.R. Graham tomorrow or things could get interesting. It sounds like Ryan Pressly will be the first one out of the bullpen once Graham is done. Brian Duensing and Tim Stauffer could be used but they did pitch tonight and the bullpen was gassed when it left for Boston. That's why the Twins were relieved that <mark>Kyle Gibson</mark> was able to go seven innings on Friday when it looked like he was going to hit the showers early. La Velle E.

This year, US retailers announced 9,302 store closings, a 59% jump from 2018 and the highest number since Coresight Research began tracking the data in 2012. Bankruptcies in the retail sector intensified this year and many struggling chains cut stores. That led to a spike in closings. Payless, Gymboree, Charlotte Russe and Shopko all filed for bankruptcy and closed a combined 3,720 stores, according to Coresight. The majority of those were because of Payless, which filed for its second bankruptcy in February and shuttered 2,100 US stores. Discount chain Fred's filed for bankruptcy in September and closed 564 stores. Forever 21 also filed for bankruptcy that month and said it will close up to 178 stores. Forever 21's closures are not in Coresight's report since they are not finalized. Other retailers, such as <mark>Ann Taylor</mark> parent Ascena Retail, Family Dollar, GNC, Walgreens, Signet Jewelers, Victoria's Secret and JCPenney, slashed their store footprints to save money and prop up higher-performing stores. Family Dollar closed 359 this year, while Signet, the parent company of mall stalwarts Kay, Jared and Zales, announced 159 closures. Thousands more store closings could be on the way in the coming years as online shopping continues to replace purchases at physical stores and eat into retailers' profits. High debt levels and rent have also burdened traditional retailers. Online sales make up around 16% of retail sales today, but they will rise to 25% by 2026, UBS analysts estimated in a research report. That could force up to 75,000 mores stores to close by 2026, including more than 20,000 clothing stores and about 10,000 consumer electronics stores, UBS estimates. Thousands of home furnishings and sporting goods stores will also need to close as online shopping grows rapidly. Even thriving retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy quietly closed a handful of their stores--although those companies are opening some, too. And department stores such as Nordstrom and Kohl's are shuttering a few stores each. As of Monday, Macy's was the worst stock on the S & P 500 this year, losing 49%, while Gap, L Brands, Kohl's and Nordstrom were in the bottom 20 on the index. Moody's lowered its outlook for department stores heading into the holiday season. \"Despite a very favorable consumer spending environment, department stores have yet to catch a break,\" analyst Christinia Boni said in a research report. <mark>Michael Brown</mark>, partner in the consumer and retail practice of consulting firm AT Kearney, said that he expects store closings to outplace openings in 2020 as retailers continue to \"right size\" their footprints. Some retailers are opening stores, however. The Coresight report noted that this year, retailers announced 4,392 openings this year. The discount sector in particular is growing. Dollar General announced it opened 975 stores this year, a similar number to previous years. \"We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail,\" Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on a call with analysts earlier this month. Dollar General will open 1,000 new stores next year and it plans for an additional 13,000 around the country. Meanwhile, discount chains like Ollie's Bargain Outlet and Five Below expanded this year. Discount grocer Aldi and opened hundreds of stores in the United States to reach customers who want to shop for cheap groceries, and TJX continued its rapid growth, opening nearly 200 stores. Some parts of the retail business could bounce back next year. \"Malls are benefiting from the refreshing influence of Generation Zers, who prefer to shop in stores and are driving traffic back to brick-and-mortar retail,\" real estate firm CBRE analysts said in a research report. Online brands will open stores, food and beverage concepts are growing, gyms and fitness concepts are spreading, and pop-up stores continue to be a popular tool for many retailers. A healthy economy should also continue to bolster many retailers and malls in the coming year. \"We expect continued growth and strength for both retailers and shopping center owners as consumer fundamentals remain strong,\" said JLL CEO Greg Maloney.

(OTCQB: OXYS) (\"OxySure,\" or the \"Company\" ), today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues were $2.4 million, up 35%, led by an 83% increase in revenues in the US Model 615 shipments up 18%; Replacement cartridge shipments up 35% Replacement cartridges up to 144% of Model 615 shipped Julian T. Ross, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of OxySure stated, \"We are pleased to have grown the business once again, while remaining focused on building a solid medical device platform to leverage growth opportunities going forward. We are now remarkably well-positioned as an emerging medical device leader to achieve our goals for 2015 and beyond. These goals include rapidly growing our direct sales force, expanding overseas, launching a direct to consumer (DTC) campaign, uplisting our company to NYSE or Nasdaq, and making strategic acquisitions.\" For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, revenues increased by 35% to $2,437,402 from $1,800,327 in 2013. The increase was primarily driven by an 83% surge in revenues in the United States. The revenue increase in the US was driven primarily by an increase in sales from products for the military in connection with a teaming agreement. For the Company's Model 615 portable emergency oxygen product, unit cartridge reorder rates continued to increase as the installed base of Model 615 increases, continuing the trend of a very \"sticky\" customer relationship with the product upon adoption. Unit cartridge shipments as a percentage of Model 615 shipments increased to 144% in FY2014 from 125% in FY2013. Cartridges as a percentage of the Model 615 installed base as at December 31, 2014 increased to 45%, up from 39.3% as at December 31, 2013. During FY2014, Model 615 shipments increased 18% versus FY2013, and replacement cartridge shipments increased 35% versus FY2013. This continues to be consistent with historical trends of rising reorders as customers become more accustomed to OxySure's products. Gross profit was $1,018,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 15.7% from $1,207,341, primarily due to the effect of an increase in absorbed rent expense and labor cost. Adjusted for these rent and labor expenses gross profit was $1,352,746 representing a gross margin of 56%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2014 were $2,469,711 compared to $1,339,624 for fiscal year 2013. The Company increased sales and marketing expenses by 104% to $718,705 as it expanded its sales and marketing, branding and investor relations efforts. General and administrative expenses also increased by 78% to $1,751,006 primarily as a result of an increase in employee stock option expense, an increase in salaries and wages, and an increase in professional fees. Professional fees increased primarily due to legal and accounting fees related to an acquisition transaction the Company pursued during the second half of 2014 but did not consummate during FY2014. Interest expense increased to approximately $907,612 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $249,979 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the amortization of debt discount and beneficial conversion features (BCF). The Company recorded approximately $747,612 in non-cash interest related to debt discount amortization during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $207,239 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Net loss during fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,753,560, or $0.10 per share, as compared to $712,452 or $0.03 per share for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The weighted average shares outstanding were 26,367,254 and 23,754,402 for fiscal year 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company's balance sheet remained strong. Cash was $647,093 at December 31, 2014 as compared to $657,673 at December 31, 2013. Working capital was a surplus of $418,734 at December 31, 2014 as compared to a surplus of $747,473 at December 31, 2013. The Company's current ratio was 1.3 as at December 31, 2014. Cash from financing activities was down 24% to $1.16 million during FY2014 from $1.52 million during FY2013. The Company had deferred income tax assets of $5,588,365 and $4,733,483 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively which were offset in full by a valuation allowance. OxySure enters 2015 in a remarkably strong position as an emerging medical device leader. Over the past 12 months, the Company: Expanded its international distribution footprint by adding new distributors such as HTM Medico for Singapore, and Ajad Medical for Saudi Arabia; Received CE Mark Approval for the OxySure Model 615 Portable Emergency Oxygen Device, a critical step toward launching the product into the 30 countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA); Commenced a pilot for a cloud-based tracking and incident reporting system; Made significant progress on the development of new products for the military; Secured Cliff Meidl, two-time Olympian and Team USA Olympic Flag Bearer to be a Spokesman and Special Advisor exclusively to the Company; Was selected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as one of 10 companies, including Caterpillar, Qualcomm and others to exhibit its product and related technologies at the Innovation Expo held at the Smithsonian; Made significant staffing additions to enhance medical device platform capability, including a VP of Resuscitation Sales, Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance, and additions in engineering, manufacturing and territory sales management; and Opportunistically invested in operational efficiencies. The Company plans to continue its focus on growth by expanding its direct sales force and its global distribution channel. The Company also plans to ramp up its sales and marketing activities to raise market awareness and grow its brand, while maintaining a focus on regulatory approvals and compliance and reductions in product costs and operational costs. These initiatives and investments will result in higher sales for OxySure in the future, and at the same time expand OxySure's leadership position in the emergency/short-duration oxygen market and the pre-hospital medical emergency market in general. \"We are excited about 2015 as we anticipate continued growth, new opportunities and even the possibility of catalytic events,\" said Mr. Ross. \"We plan to continue to work hard to improve our products, our competitive position, and our category leadership, while striving to maintain our culture of innovation as we grow.\" OxySure's CEO Julian Ross will host the conference call to discuss the Company's fiscal year 2014 results.

City went down 1-0 to a disputed late goal from Georgie Kelly, but Fenn was impressed with the response following the defeat at home to Waterford last Monday. \"I was gutted for the boys, really,\" he said. \"I know that it's a tough place to come but we were disciplined. We restricted them to nothing of note in the first-half, we knew the pressure was going to come in the second half but I felt we weathered it quite well.\" It was always going to be tough, we had a lot of injuries and a lot of lads missing, but I can't complain or be disappointed with any of the players. I was disappointed with the result, obviously, but the performance of the boys was excellent. \"I was critical of the boys on Monday night and I think they'll admit that they didn't defend properly, or on Friday [against Sligo Rovers].\" Against Dundalk, when the chips were down, they really defended well, restricted Dundalk to a couple of half-chances before the goal. It was unfortunate, the boys were saying that he punched it in, he never headed it, so it's disappointing from that point of view but I can't fault the overall performance. \"Dundalk's Andy Boyle with <mark>Mark O'Sullivan</mark> of Cork City. Picture: INPHO/Morgan Treacy Ultimately, Dundalk's quality told, with City missing a number of key players which deprived Fenn of options from the bench in the second half.\" Our bench was kids, apart from <mark>Alan Bennett</mark>, \"he said.\" We've got [Kevin] O\u2019Connor out, [Garry] Buckley out, [Gear\u00f3id] Morrissey out, [Karl] Sheppard out, [Joel] Coustrain out--that's five players you would imagine would be near the starting 11. \"Alec Byrne came in against Dundalk and was excellent, but at the time, we're just going through a little bit of a time with injuries and it's tough, especially with three games in a week.\" Without a game this weekend, it gives us a chance to get those boys back and then we'll have a bench and a squad to choose from and you've got decisions. At the moment, we're just playing the lads that are fit. \"City's next league game is at home to Finn Harps on Friday week, with this Saturday seeing <mark>Alan Bennett</mark>'s testimonial take place. Fenn is glad of the opportunity to take stock.\" I won't lie, I've had a tough couple of weeks! \"he laughed.\" I was extremely disappointed with the result on Friday, nobody wants to go up there and lose, but the performance gave me hope and gave the lads hope too that they can dig out a result. \"They didn't on Friday but, with a fully fit squad and options off the bench--and that's no disrespect to the young lads--it gives you a different dimension.\" The break's coming at a good time, it gives the injured players time to get fit. \""}, {"articleID": "2014110910_00027683_W", "names": {"Douglas Adams": ["Q28421831", "Q932869"]}, "date": "2014-11-09", "url": "http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/latestnews/2627035-8/top-25-signs-you-might-be-a-band", "content": "As the marching band season draws to a close, band geeks everywhere are putting away their lyres, taking off their face paint and quietly reverting to the wintertime discipline of the concert band. The days of stressing over field maneuvers have come to a close, and the public starts to forget that their beloved band exists. That is, until basketball season, when it's summoned to try to make everyone excited about their great (or losing) team...again. The life of an always-on-call, always-spirited, I-believe-that-we-will-win pep band is one of multiple personality characteristics. As a concert band member, students will sit and tune, play the dynamics, pretend to listen to the director and focus on the balance of the band like a good musician is supposed to do. Shy band members avoid attention, and attention avoids them. Meanwhile, the school newspaper reporters groan when they have to go take photographs at the concerts. Then the big game rolls around, and all of a sudden the band is all-out screaming and singing and cheering and playing as loud as it can without a care for intonation. Nobody listens to anybody else, least of all the director. And meanwhile, mysteriously so, the newspaper gets every picture of the pep band in its stadium habitat. As one of these band geeks, I'll miss marching season like everybody else. However, I also know how necessary the concert band is to all of our lives. So now, as band fades for a few weeks from the memory of the general public, the rules by which every band geek lives, during both concert and pep band seasons, deserve some attention. In other words, you know you're a band geek when...1. You don't step on a scale every morning. You play one. 2. You walk by someone playing music in their car and you start marching in step. 3. Despite the claim by author <mark>Douglas Adams</mark> in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" the ultimate answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything is no longer 42. It's unison octaves. 4. When listening to pop music, you feel isolated by the lack of wind instrumentation. 5. You're watching a movie, and there's machine-gun fire. Your reaction: \"Who invited the snare drum?\" 6. You start comparing varsity track to wind ensemble. 7. You're prejudiced against the string players in the orchestra because they perform like dead people. That is, they don't have to breathe. 8. You dream of Disneyland...the music studio, not the theme park. 9. Someone's singing their favorite song and you wince because they're 20 cents flat in the wrong key. 10. When you're bored, you compose songs in your head and hum them aloud, to the harmony of your friends' complaints. 11. You know what a bass clarinet looks like. (Rare) 12. You know what a bass clarinet sounds like. (Rarer) 13. Same thing about the contrabass flute, soprano sax, English horn, sousaphone and bassoon. 14. The movie \"Drumline\" touched you more deeply than any other sports comeback story. 15. You know how to fix a broken music stand. But you have also perfected the art of avoiding the task. 16. You hum in tune with your refrigerator. 17. You know who Mendelssohn was. And how to spell \"Mendelssohn.\" 18. For you, time is only relative to the metronome. 19. People ask if you're bilingual; because you are in band you respond that you speak Italian. 20. You know the names of at least five music professors at the closest college. 21. In social studies class, you sit on the front six inches of your chair. Because you know it's best for your diaphragm. 22. The majority of your wardrobe is sweatshirts and pep shirts sporting your school's colors. 23. You use phrases like \"variations on the same theme\" in common conversation and don't even notice. 24. In addition to the inner and outer personas, you have a \"band persona.\" 25. Upon reflection...all your friends are band geeks like you."}, {"articleID": "2018012005_00402996_W", "names": {"Jeffrey Smith": ["Q42699211", "Q57441012"], "David Campos": ["Q12054131", "Q56509186", "Q56558506"], "Miguel Marquez": ["Q6014815", "Q6844663"]}, "date": "2018-01-20", "url": "https://patch.com/california/cupertino/campaign-embracing-immigrants-launches-santa-clara-county-wide", "content": "health & fitness Campaign Embracing Immigrants Launches Santa Clara County-Wide \"This is a campaign to say,\" You are not you, and we are not we. We are all. Immigrants are all .' \"0 SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA--The County of Santa Clara's Office of Immigrant Relations launched a coordinated media campaign this morning to emphasize the county's support and resources for immigrants living in the county. County officials gathered with the consuls general from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in front of a Valley Transportation Authority bus with one of the campaign ads to make remarks on how and why the campaign was created. The campaign, advertised with posters that read,\" One county, one future, \"is designed to focus on\" the value of differences in the community, \"County Executive <mark>Jeffrey Smith</mark> said. The campaign will primarily highlight public health and social services, though the county offers many more resources available to the immigrant community, according to <mark>Smith</mark>. This campaign comes in the wake of recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in four Bay Area counties on Jan. 10, when 21 people were arrested and ordered to appear in immigration court. The event was a follow-up operation that stemmed from a 2013 investigation, according to a statement from ICE. County Office of Immigrant Relations Director Maria Love also said that the county works to make sure that immigrants arrested by ICE have access to legal defense, including through a $3.5 million investment in community organizations that offer free legal services. The Rapid Response Network of Santa Clara County and the County Office of Immigration Relations have been working together, Love said. The RRN has a 24/7 hotline with attorneys standing by in the event that someone wants to report a raid happening or has had a family member picked up by ICE during a raid. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office had two representatives present in solidarity. <mark>Smith</mark> said that they are\" liberal \"and honor the sanctuary county rules, meaning that they do not report undocumented immigrants to ICE and keep their information confidential. They will not be following federal threats or ICE threats in the effort to deport undocumented residents, <mark>Smith</mark> said. <mark>Smith</mark> described Love, an immigrant from El Salvador, as\" the mastermind of the campaign. \"Love said that the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors tasked her department with creating the campaign. According to <mark>Smith</mark>, about 100 county employees worked on it. Love said that her department talked to immigrants that live in Santa Clara County to determine what messages were most important. Love said that the campaign's objective is for the community to know that no matter what happens at the federal level, the county will support both documented and undocumented immigrants by giving them the resources that they need.\" Our immigrants are good people, the vast majority of them work hard, are documented and contribute significantly to our community, \"<mark>Smith</mark> said.\" The people who are not documented are only undocumented because we have a very abhorrent and very ineffective immigration policy nationwide. \"Deputy county executive <mark>David Campos</mark> highlighted that several employees who worked on the campaign are\" Dreamers themselves, \"individuals who entered the country as minors and were largely raised in the U.S. Santa Clara County Chief Operating Officer <mark>Miguel Marquez</mark> echoed <mark>Smith</mark>'s statement, telling his own sibling's stories of success as\" one of the true stories of immigrants. \"<mark>Marquez</mark> spoke of the two nationwide injunctions against President Trump's executive orders, one that protects sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide and one that allows\" Dreamers \"to renew their Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status that allowed them to reside in the United States. According to <mark>Marquez</mark>, county officials are doing all they can for each resident of the county, but especially for those foreign-born residents that make up more than 70 percent of the Silicon Valley workforce. All of the consul generals spoke in accord with county officials and the significance of the campaign in helping the immigrant community.\" We are all people, no matter our color, no matter our race and no matter our immigration status, \"said Consul General of El Salvador Ana Valuenzuela. Consul General of Guatemala Patricia Lavagnino called the campaign\" brave. \"\"This is a campaign to say,\" You are not you, and we are not we. We are all. Immigrants are all,' \"Lavagnino said. The campaign has a budget of about $40,000, and can be expanded as needed, according to <mark>Smith</mark>.\" Our major issue is trying to get the message out to our clients, \"<mark>Smith</mark> said.\" We are here to provide services for people who are typically underserved. \"The campaign ads will be posted at buses and bus stops with the reasoning that the targeted community needs those transportation services to get to the community resources the county can provide. They will also be in government buildings and advertised in a mail campaign, <mark>Smith</mark> said.
