(action) pass and getting out on the outside and making some plays. \"rookie t.j. yates, a fifth-round pick out of north carolina, is leinart's backup, but kubiak isn't ruling out adding another quarterback this week. <mark>jeff garcia</mark>, brodie croyle, trent edwards, kellen clemens and former rice star <mark>chase clement</mark> tried out for the team monday morning. the 41-year-old <mark>garcia</mark> hasn't played in the nfl since 2009. he played for omaha in the ufl last year. edwards was cut by oakland in training camp after spending three full seasons with buffalo and one in jacksonville. clemens was cut by washington during training camp, and that may give him an edge - the redskins are coached by <mark>mike shanahan</mark>, kubiak's longtime mentor. the contents of this website may not be reproduced without written", "articleID": "2011112200_00007127_W", "names": {"Andre Johnson": ["Q4754810", "Q748287"], "Chase Clement": ["Q14950669", "Q14950810"], "Jeff Garcia": ["Q1373024", "Q3990"], "Mike Shanahan": ["Q17025605", "Q1857407", "Q27973761", "Q47467791"], "Pat Sullivan": ["Q2056577", "Q22096536", "Q28672846", "Q7144051", "Q7144053", "Q7144054"]}}, {"date": "2011-11-23", "url": "http://mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/article/Kuwait-needs-reform-not-more-repression-2292629.php", "content": "the following editorial appeared in the washington post: kuwait has long prided itself on having the most liberal political system among the arab monarchies of the persian gulf. an elected parliament contains a substantial opposition that regularly criticizes the ruling al-sabah family. yet no one would mistake kuwait for a democracy; the power of the assembly is strictly limited, and organized political parties are nonexistent. a recent dust-up in the parliament suggested that as the arab spring continues, the limited political opening offered by kuwait and other arab monarchies will prove insufficient. thousands of protesters gathered outside the parliament building to protest reports of government corruption, according to news accounts. when police tried to disperse the crowd, dozens of the protesters broke into the parliament, where they sang the national anthem before departing. the demonstration prompted an angry statement by the ruling emir, sheikh sabah al-ahmed al-sabah, who \"ordered the interior ministry and the national guards...to put an end to such shameful provocative acts .\" rather than threatening repression, the emir would be wise to listen to the opposition, which has legitimate grievances. the parliament has been blocked from investigating a major corruption scandal, including reports of multimillion-dollar deposits in the bank accounts of some parliament members and transfers by government officials to foreign accounts. sheikh nasser mohammad al-ahmed al-sabah, the 71-year-old prime minister, who is the emir's nephew, remains in office despite being the target of multiple motions of no-confidence. what kuwait needs is not a crackdown, but a quicker progression toward a genuine parliamentary democracy, in which the prime minister would be chosen by a majority of the parliament. prodded by domestic demonstrations, two other arab monarchies, morocco and jordan, have begun moving in that direction. these partial reforms offer a way forward for kuwait, bahrain, qatar and other persian gulf states - including, inevitably, saudi arabia. each country will move at its own pace, but if revolution is to be avoided, the reform process must progress toward genuine democracy. in an interview with the bbc last week, <mark>king abdullah</mark> predicted the arab spring was \"not even halfway through .\" if that is true, the way to invite the \"chaos\" kuwait's emir is warning would be for his regime and others to resist the imperative for change.", "articleID": "2011112807_00041654_W", "names": {"King Abdullah": ["Q57298", "Q57464"]}}, {"date": "2011-11-29", "url": "http://istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle/articleid/5567994", "content": "u.s. market trade in green as european debt crisis gets new hopes; hot stocks of the day: sne, wilc, axp, goog robust black friday sales stimulate hopes of stronger holiday season sales former danisco evp to lead cobalt toward commercialization mountain view, calif., nov. 29, 2011 / prnewswire /--today, cobalt technologies, a leading developer of next generation bio n-butanol, appointed bob mayer as chairman of its board of directors and chief executive officer (ceo). with over 30 years of experience in the chemicals and biotech sectors, mayer joins cobalt to lead the company as it focuses on developing commercial facilities globally. as chairman and ceo, mayer will be responsible for setting strategic direction, cultivating partnerships and driving the company to profitability. cobalt's bio n-butanol technology converts biomass and non-food waste sugars into bio n-butanol at a cost that is 40-60% lower than current petrochemical technology. n-butanol is currently sold into a multi-billion dollar market and cobalt's low-cost process enables the use of n-butanol as a chemical feedstock for conversion into a wide variety of chemicals and fuels, greatly expanding the addressable market. \"i am eager to join the cobalt team, which is in an exciting stage as it forges new business relationships and begins building large-scale facilities,\" said mayer. \"cobalt is in a prime position for explosive growth and i look forward to leveraging my experience to continue its rise in the biofuels, chemicals and jet fuels markets .\" mayer, who has extensive experience growing businesses within the biotech sector as the former executive vice president of danisco, will also lead the development of strategic business relationships and fundraising for the company. \"we are pleased bob has joined the cobalt team as chief executive officer and we look forward to working under his leadership to continue advancing the company,\" said <mark>john hamer</mark> of burrill and company, the outgoing chairman. \"bob's wealth of experience in the mature biotech and chemicals markets is invaluable for cobalt, which has moved out of pilot testing and into larger-scale projects on the road to commercialization .\" post comment--login is required to post message perma-fix announces its eleventh annual mixed & low level waste management forum zacks investment research, and commentary, news and press releases provided by yellowbrix and quotemedia. all information provided \"as is\" for informational purposes only, not intended for trading purposes or advice. istockanalyst.com is not an investment adviser and does not provide, endorse or review any information or data contained herein. the blog articles are opinions by respective blogger. by using this site you are agreeing to terms and conditions posted on respective bloggers' website. the postings/comments on the site may or may not be from reliable sources. neither istockanalyst nor any of its independent providers is liable for any informational errors, incompleteness, or delays, or for any actions taken in reliance on information contained herein. you are solely responsible for the investment decisions made by you and the consequences resulting therefrom. by accessing the istockanalyst.com site, you agree not to redistribute the information found therein. we prefer not to publish articles related to otcbb or pink sheet securities. we do not accept articles containing offesive language, racial remarks, sex / pornography beyond the requirement of the story.", "articleID": "2011112913_00010024_W", "names": {"John Hamer": ["Q16106649", "Q2300893"]}}, {"date": "2011-11-30", "url": "http://reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/us-olympics-italy-rome-idUSTRE7AT1KG20111130?feedType=RSS&feedName=sportsNews", "content": "rome (reuters) -

when dean di tosto bought long-term care insurance in 1998, he believed he was locking in a low rate. now the 83-year-old minnetonka, minn., resident feels duped. his insurance company, <mark>john hancock</mark>, raised the premiums twice in the past three years. the payments could go from $140 to $202 a month, a 44 percent increase. \"i understand the need for these increases,\" he said. \"i'm not a dummy. but it should affect future new policyholders, not those of us who have already put in thousands of dollars. many people can't go out and make more money to make up the difference .\" trapped between fast-rising costs for care and weak returns on their investments, insurers have been raising long-term care premiums by double-digit percentages. in minnesota, for example, <mark>john hancock</mark>, one of many companies to seek increases from the state, secured average rate increases of 13 percent in 2008 and 40 percent in 2010. some worry that higher premiums will make people less likely to get long-term care insurance - a potentially serious problem at a time when aging baby boomers' needs for long-term care are about to explode. ultimately, that could force people to lean on government programs to pay for nursing-home care and other costs. \"we've identified it as a priority for our health reform cabinet,\" said minnesota commerce commissioner mike rothman, whose office regulates the insurance industry. \"we're looking at it, monitoring it, and making sure that when those rate increases come in, that they're not exorbitant .\" long-term care insurance pays a fixed amount of daily benefits for a certain period of time. premiums are based on factors such as age, gender and health. state and federal lawmakers have spent considerable energy trying to encourage the middle class to plan ahead with long-term care insurance, without much luck. the obama administration last month scrapped the class act, a long-term care insurance program and major piece of federal health care reform. even though the medicaid program was designed as a safety net for people in poverty, middle-class seniors routinely deplete their assets and turn to the state. more than 180,000 minnesotans have long-term care insurance policies, designed to help seniors pay living costs later in life without being forced to deplete savings or sell their homes. the average cost of care is about $48,000 a year, but nursing homes can cost $80,000. in minnesota, medicaid pays about 40 percent of long-term elder care. costs could rise fivefold by 2035 to an \"unsustainable burden\" of $5 billion, according to a report last year from the citizens league. minnesota launched a program in 2008 that allows median-income households that buy long-term care policies to shelter some assets if they apply for medicaid. still, only about 11 percent of people in the state have the insurance. minnesota has tightened its long-term care law to add consumer protections and force insurers to build a stronger case to regulators for premium increases. but those rules only affect policies written in 2002 and beyond. long-term care coverage is a relatively new product. though policies have been available since the 1970s, sales didn't start taking off until 1996, when the federal government offered modest income tax advantages. a combination of factors has driven the recent price increases. insurers set their rates on assumptions that some people would let their policies lapse. but people held on to policies longer than expected. and their claims are bigger because they're living longer. low interest rates have had perhaps the biggest impact, because insurers planned to cover claims based on reserves they invested. when those investments fell short of expectations, insurers turned to policyholders to make up the difference. \"it's the perfect storm,\" said amy pahl, who advises insurance companies on long-term financial projections and regulatory matters for the actuarial firm milliman. \"you're looking at collecting premiums and investing them for 30, 40 or 50 years before a payout,\" she said. \"ten or 15 years ago, interest rates appeared to be sustainable at 6 or 7 percent. every american knows that's unachievable now .\" the difficulty of making the risks and financing work over such a long time horizon has led a number of companies to get out of the business, including blue cross and blue shield of minnesota, allianz life and ameriprise, paul said. a decade ago, 130 companies sold long-term care insurance. today there are about 20, she said. deb newman - whose richfield, minn.-based company, newman long term care, is one of the biggest long-term care sellers in the country - has sympathy for policyholders facing increases. she's one of them. a policy she bought 18 years ago went from $725 annual premiums to about $1,100. even so, it's a better deal than waiting, she said. similar coverage would cost someone who bought a policy now about $5,000 annually. \"people are understandably surprised when the insurance companies say,\" oops, we have to go back and increase everyone's premiums by 40 percent,' \"she said .\" but it's still a tremendous value relative to what they could purchase today. \"the squeeze is especially tough for people who bought policies in the 1980s and 1990s. some of those policies didn't cover assisted living or adult day care, because they didn't exist at the time. in an emailed response to questions, a <mark>john hancock</mark> spokeswoman said,\" the company has always tried to provide alternatives to policyholders facing rate increases so they can keep premiums close to their current levels. \"the alternatives include reducing the benefit period, adjusting the benefit amount or allowing policyholders to reduce inflation coverage, the company said. di tosto, a former marketing executive who runs a small business with his son, said he can afford higher premiums for himself and his wife, inga. he remains angry that his choices are to pay up, reduce his benefits, or cancel and lose the $50,000-plus he has paid over the past 13 years. he's made it his mission to push elected officials to do more to protect the state's elderly and infirm. health insurers must post reasons for premium increases under new rules guidelines for posting on bangordailynews.com the bangor daily news encourages comments about stories, but you must follow our terms of service. in brief: keep it civil and stay on topic no vulgarity, racial slurs, name-calling or personal attacks. people who harass others or joke about tragedies will be blocked. the primary rule here is pretty simple: treat others with the same respect you'd want for yourself. here are some guidelines (don't insult one another or the subjects of bdn stories. you may be ticked off at what someone did or said, but you can explain that without resorting to name-calling or obscenity. remember that young people are on this site too. that nasty line that makes your buddies go\" haw, haw \"? you're better than that. comments should be your own work, not copied and pasted from elsewhere, though brief quoted passages to make your point are fine. and please don't use all capital letters. there's no need to shout. stay focused on the issue in the article. off-topic posts will be deleted. this isn't a forum to chat about your personal life. some ideas -
