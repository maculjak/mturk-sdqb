an early blitz saw off salford at the jjb stadium on friday night. the warriors set themselves up for a convincing 38-12 engage super league win with 22 unanswered points in a stunning opening 16 minutes. <mark>noble</mark> said: \"i thought our execution, the level of our skill and the quality of our passing was pretty special in that first 20-25 minutes .\" we got a little scruffy after that, but the discipline of our play in that period was good and something we can take into the rest of the season. \"george carmont, <mark>tim smith</mark>, pat richards and mark riddell all crossed in that purple patch. richards, who kicked six goals, later added a second and harrison hansen also went over for <mark>noble</mark>'s men. it was a second convincing win over salford in the space of seven days following last week's challenge cup success and <mark>noble</mark> felt his players' attitude had been excellent .\" it was a little bit like after the lord mayor's parade, \"he added .\" it can be a dangerous fixture and mentally you've got to be ready. \"i'm delighted we've come up with two points because we need to start getting the points in this competition .\" <mark>noble</mark> also praised the efforts of captain <mark>sean o'loughlin</mark> while explaining the reasons for leaving out sam tomkins in a week the young star was called up by england. <mark>noble</mark> said: \"<mark>sean o'loughlin</mark> has got to be in line for man of steel, he has been outstanding for us every game .\" it's brilliant sam's going with england. my only concern is we don't put him in the universe team before his feet have landed. \"we know we haven't got him next week so it was important we had a look at <mark>smith</mark>.\" salford coach shaun mcrae admitted his side was outplayed in the opening spell but believed it could still take positives from the game. luke swain, <mark>mark henry</mark> and malcolm alker all scored while scrum-half richie myler had another positive game. mcrae said: \"we were clearly blown away at the start of the game .\" we had 12 sets in the first half and that is not going to put you in a winning position. that is the difference, compared to their 23 sets. \"in the second half we had 24 sets, wigan had 17 and we had twice as much ball. then we showed what we can do and i am encouraged that we won the second half 12-6. copyright \u00a9 1999-2009

million in the accounts of payment processors that handle the winnings of thousands of online poker players. the justice department has long maintained that internet gambling is illegal, a view that

obtained by the ap show that a judge in the district issued a seizure warrant last week for an account at a wells fargo bank in san francisco, and that a federal prosecutor told a bank in arizona to freeze an account. in a letter dated friday and faxed to alliance bank of arizona, the prosecutor said that accounts held by payment processor allied systems inc. are subject to seizure and forfeiture \"because they constitute property involved in money laundering transactions and illegal gambling offenses .\" the letter was signed by arlo devlin-brown, the assistant u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york. in another letter faxed the same day, devlin-brown asks that the bank treat the funds \"as legally seized\" by the fbi, saying that the government has probable cause that the gambling payments of u.s. residents had been directed to offshore illegal internet gambling businesses. a spokeswoman at the southern district declined to comment. <mark>john pappas</mark>, executive director of the poker players alliance, called the government's move an \"unprecedented action\" against online poker players. in a letter monday night to devlin-brown, <mark>pappas</mark> said that the funds belong to the alliance's members, and requested that his group be notified and given the opportunity to be heard regarding attempts to seize the frozen funds. \"the ppa will pursue every

permit? or you're not going to get a permit? none of us knows, right now, exactly what this means .\" roberts says this new process will most impact the project permits that are in the process of being filed now. \"it could mean that people might lose their jobs and not be able to work in the future or it could mean that it's just going to be more difficult to get a permit or it could mean that permits will be issued and they'll just be taken a harder look at .\" as the process moves forward, roberts says all of the groups involved in the coal industry, including those in the
