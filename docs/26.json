He added that\" this storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now \"in certain areas of the state. Some parts of the state were getting 2 to 3 inches an hour, <mark>Cooper</mark> said .\" That's enough to cause flooding in areas that have never flooded before until now, \"<mark>Cooper</mark> said. Since the storm made landfall as a hurricane in North Carolina on Friday morning, it has been blamed for 16 deaths. Officials said that 10 people died in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. The death toll included a person killed Sunday in a pickup truck crash near Gilbert, South Carolina, that occurred when the motorist drove through standing water on a roadway, according to the South Carolina Department of Public Safety. Hundreds of people have been rescued by local authorities, Cajun Navy volunteers and the U.S. Coast Guard since Friday morning. New evacuation orders were issued Sunday for a mile-long area along the Cape Fear and Little rivers in North Carolina. More than 700,000 households and businesses in the state were still without power as of Sunday afternoon, an estimated 15,000 people were in shelters, and 171 primary roads were closed including parts of two interstates, authorities said. The state Highway Patrol advised people to stay off the roads, saying troopers responded to 48 collisions from Saturday night and into Sunday morning. Adding to the threat of further flooding, a tornado watch was in effect for most of Sunday for the areas of Wilmington, Fayetteville, Myrtle Beach, Jacksonville, Oak Island, and Florence .\" It's bad right now, and we do expect it to get worse over the coming days, \"Michael Sprayberry, director of North Carolina Emergency Management, said on ABC's\" This Week \"Sunday .\" We know that's going to be a major mission going forward because this is historic and unprecedented flooding. \"Major river flooding a threat Catastrophic flooding unfolded Sunday morning in parts of North Carolina, exceeding flooding 19 years ago in Hurricane Floyd. the National Weather Service said. One waterway, the Cape Fear River, rose 15 feet in just 24 hours from early Saturday to early Sunday. It reached flood stage in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where mandatory evacuation orders were issued Saturday .\" This will be very dangerous flooding over the next few days, \"the National Weather Service said in a tweet Sunday morning. The Coast Guard head echoed this view .\" My biggest concern is the rising water, \"Schultz said on\" This Week, \"noting that Wilmington, North Carolina, got 24 inches of rain and could potentially get 15 inches more .\" We're looking at a high water situation, \"he said .\" The rivers could potentially crest here into the early part of this week. So, we have not seen the worst of the flooding. \"Schultz was among the emergency officials who briefed President Trump on the storm on Saturday .\" We talked about the massive risk the storm poses, catastrophic flooding, prolonged flooding, \"he said of the briefing .\" We gave him an update on response capabilities in the theater and the president is completely leaning in. Anything the feds need to do to support the local, the state partners here in South Carolina and North Carolina. We feel fully supported. \"The Lumber River, near Lumberton, North Carolina, rose to into major flood stage Sunday. It is expected to reach a level very near the record Hurricane Matthew set in 2016. Mandatory evacuations were issued for South Lumberton on Saturday. Major river flooding is also expected on some rivers from southern Virginia to northern South Carolina. The Northeast Cape Fear River, near Chinquapin, North Carolina, will rise above record flood levels set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. This will cause devastating flooding across much of Onslow County with travel made impossible and many homes completely flooded. The Neuse River, both near Goldsboro and Kinston, North Carolina, will reach major flood stage late Sunday and into Monday. The Waccamaw River, near Conway, South Carolina, will rise near record levels by the end of the week. Florence has dropped a tremendous amount of rain in eastern North Carolina, with a widespread 20 to 30 inches reported already. Radar is estimating that some areas between Wilmington and New Bern, North Carolina, have received over 30 inches of rain. These are some of the latest rainfall totals as of 11 p.m. on Saturday:--Swansboro, N.C.--30.59 inches--Newport/Morehead City, N.C.--25.20 inches--Elizabethtown, N.C.--20.17 inches--Jacksonville, N.C.--16.13 inches--Conway, S.C.--9.90 inches--Myrtle Beach Airport, S.C.--6.74 inches Florence is now the third storm to set a tropical cyclone state rainfall record in just the last 12 months. Harvey dropped 60.58 inches of rain last year in Texas, setting the state's new record. Lane just last month dropped 52.02 inches of rain in parts of Hawaii, breaking the state record. The 30.59 inches that have fallen in Swansboro sets a new record for North Carolina. Florence also currently stands as the sixth-highest tropical cyclone rainfall total across the U.S. for records dating back to 1950. Heavy rain spreads inland Heavy rains bands are still coming onshore in eastern South Carolina and North Carolina on Sunday morning. Some of the heavier bands have shifted toward Fayetteville, Charlotte, and Raleigh. Torrential rain is causing inland flooding with major roadways, including large portions of I-95, closed. An additional 6 to 10 inches of rain is still possible along the southeast border of North Carolina and South Carolina. Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding is likely over the southern to central Appalachians from western North Carolina into western Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Torrential rain will cause flash flooding and increase the risk of landslides in the higher terrains. Florence is still moving very slowly inland. The track shows Florence moving west through Sunday, and then gradually turning north by Monday. Florence will likely become a remnant low within 36 hours. Even though Florence is weakening, it will still bring significant rainfall inland to the Appalachians before moving toward the Northeast on Tuesday. Totals could exceed 4 inches locally for inland New York and Massachusetts .\" People need to heed the warnings from their local emergency management experts and stay in safe ground, \"the Coast Guard's Adm. Schultz said. Related Topics: abc news national SHARE: share tweet share email (Copyright \u00a9 2018 ABC News Internet Ventures .)

British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman, James Slack, said Britain was \"seriously disappointed\" by the decision, which reverses a 2017 court ruling legalizing gay marriage.

He said the bill \"has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government .\" Some opposition politicians criticized the government, saying Britain should have intervened to prevent the change, which they called discriminatory. Labour Party foreign affairs spokeswoman Helen Goodman said the legislation was \"shameful\" and \"turns same-sex couples into second-class citizens .\" Foreign Office Minister Harriett Baldwin said \"after full and careful consideration\" the government had decided not to block the legislation. She said Britain's powers to intervene with laws in its overseas territories \"can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional

tried not to think about what kind of effect they could do his career. but those thoughts were impossible for the ducks' top goaltender to keep out of his mind whenever he sat in the waiting room for the many appointments to diagnose and deal with the ailment that was affecting his head. as he proclaimed himself symptom-free on friday and fit for training camp next month, hiller talked about the mental strain he was under over the last three months of a potential vezina trophy-caliber season that was interrupted for good. \"normally i'm used to where if i want something really bad, i can just try a little harder and somehow i get there,\" hiller said from his off-season home in his native switzerland. \"and i think in this situation, it was frustrating for me. i was pushing and trying and trying. i couldn't just push and it was gone .\" it was kind of like a new situation for me. i don't think i was thinking that was it with my career or anything. but sure it's tough. you have a lot of time to think in not playing. in the doctor's office and waiting for the appointment, you have a lot time to think about that and what's going to happen and everything. \"i always tried to not think about it too much .\" hiller is certainly in a much better frame of mind these days as he reported that his on-ice training with swiss elite league club sc bern has gone well, noting that the intensity of practices has been similar to what he'd go through on a regular day with the ducks as \"they're starting the season pretty soon here so they're already getting game ready .\" though the real test of whether he's at full strength won't come until he's in camp and playing in the preaseason, hiller said he's at the point where he'd feel comfortable competing in game action. \"i haven't played games for quite a while now so i can't make any promises,\" he said. \"i'm feeling great in practice. i see the puck well and everything. i'm definitely looking forward to be back playing as soon as possible .\" after being shut down for good during the first-round playoff loss to nashville, hiller was ordered by the team to rest in a depature from the failed process to work through the symptoms. the fourth-year nhl goalie didn't do much outside of off-ice training until last month, either spending time at home or vacationing in hawaii with his girlfriend. on july 10, hiller finally returned to the ice as he took part in the camp run by his mentor, former ducks and current toronto maple leafs goaltending coach francois allaire. he acknowledged that he felt nervous but said he cleared that hurdle. \"i went back on the ice and felt pretty good right off the bat,\" he said. \"i had some better days and some days where i was a little so-so. but i never felt like i was off a lot .\" while he said he's progress to where \"i pretty much have to say i am where i used to be\" , hiller remains a bit frustrated that no definitive cause for his vertigo has been found even after visiting with doctors in switzerland where he felt more at ease talking to them in his native german tongue. \"i got some second opinions, but nobody could really exactly tell me where it was coming from,\" he said. \"everybody was saying it could be a few things, but nobody was really able to put their finger on it. it was frustrating, especially for the future. i wish i would know what exactly happened to prevent it from coming up again .\" i definitely hope it's a one-time thing. if it is, i don't really care what actually caused it. \"in hiller's absence, the ducks responded to the implosion of backup curtis mcelhinney by getting ray emery and <mark>dan ellis</mark>. both stabilized the club's goaltending and helped the club make the playoffs with emery ultimately starting five of the six postseason games against the predators. despite the strong performance by emery, the ducks decided not to re-sign the veteran in a sign that they were hopeful that hiller would be able to regain his spot at the lead goalie with the returning <mark>ellis</mark> as his backup. hiller gave the club the kind of news it wanted to hear, at least until he hits the ice when camp opens. you can

(lay was also convicted but died months later of heart disease .) the court is as likely to be interested in the question that skilling's case raises about the honest services statute, which gives wide leeway for federal prosecutors to go after actions of public and private officials who deprive constituents or their employers of the \"intangible right of honest services .\" the statute has become a favorite tool in pursuing both public corruption cases as well as those involving corporate greed. in skilling's case, solicitor general elena kagan said that the law was properly applied, but also that skilling would have been convicted without it. but the law has engendered a backlash from those who say it is used too freely. one of those critics is justice antonin scalia, who criticized his colleagues earlier this year for not accepting a different case involving the statute. he said the law \"invites abuse by headline-grabbing prosecutors in pursuit of local officials, state legislators and corporate ceos who engage in any manner of unappealing or ethically questionable conduct .\" since then, the court has accepted the petition of black, who was accused of defrauding his company, hollinger international, and a former alaska legislator accused of drumming up business from a company that had dealings with the state, even though no state law appears to have been violated. the federal appeals courts have interpreted the law to cover widely divergent levels of conduct. the skilling case asks whether the law requires proof of personal gain. black's case raises the issue of whether there must be proof that the defendant knew there would be economic harm to his company. and the alaska case deals with whether a public official has violated his duty under state law. the supreme court full coverage of the u.s. supreme court, including key cases and nominations to the nation's highest court."}, {"articleID": "2019052508_00262293_W", "names": {"Rory Stewart": ["Q328892", "Q55363983"], "Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"], "John Mcdonnell": ["Q10379941", "Q47348016", "Q55196720", "Q6247660", "Q6247662", "Q6247664", "Q6247666", "Q694695"], "Liam Fox": ["Q16300641", "Q332374", "Q6539597"], "Jeremy Hunt": ["Q333533", "Q929730"], "Steve Baker": ["Q10379857", "Q15973457", "Q1991602", "Q2346812", "Q260111", "Q6380444", "Q7611849", "Q7611850", "Q7611852", "Q9345785"]}, "date": "2019-05-25", "url": "http://www.bromsgroveadvertiser.co.uk/news/national/17664618.tory-battle-intensifies-as-new-candidates-emerge/", "content": "Tory battle intensifies as new candidates emerge By Press Association 2019 Tory leadership front runner Boris Johnson (David Mirzoeff/PA) 0 comment The Tory leadership race has exploded into life, with Cabinet minister <mark>Rory Stewart</mark> launching an attack on Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock entering the contest. As the battle heated up, International Development Secretary Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> said he could not serve in a government led by Mr Johnson because of his stance on a possible no-deal exit from the EU. The comments came as Labour insisted it would force a Commons vote of no confidence in the new prime minister as soon as possible. As Tory tensions rose, Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a no-deal exit would be \"damaging and dishonest\". He said: \"I could not serve in a government whose policy was to push this country into a no-deal Brexit .\" I could not serve with Boris Johnson. \"I spoke to Boris, I suppose, about two weeks ago about this and I thought at the time he had assured me that he wouldn't push for a no-deal Brexit .\" So, we had a conversation about 20, 25 minutes and I left the room reassured by him that he wouldn't do this. \"But, it now seems that he is coming out for a no-deal Brexit .\" Mr <mark>Stewart</mark> said there was no majority in the Commons for no deal, stating: \"I think it would be a huge mistake. Damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest .\" Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, who has emerged as the bookies' favourite, stressed he would be prepared to back a no-deal departure to ensure the UK leaves the EU on October 31. Mr Hancock said he was running for leader because the party needed to look to the future and attract younger voters. He said he would take a different approach to try and get Commons support for a Brexit deal than the one <mark>Theresa May</mark> used. He said: \"She didn't start by levelling with people about the trade-offs .\" I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposal if you are straightforward in advance. \"Mr Hancock warned against an early election, saying:\" Some of my contenders <mark>may</mark> say that if they don't get their preferred option, whether it be no deal or something else, then they'll have a general election. \"I put it to you that would be a disaster for the country and it would risk Corbyn by Christmas .\" Asked if Labour would force a Commons no confidence vote in the new prime minister when they take office, shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> told the Today programme: \"Yes .\" Because we believe any incoming prime minister in these circumstance should go to the country anyway and seek a mandate. \"Mr <mark>McDonnell</mark> said that Labour needed to have a new\" conversation \"about the way forward on Brexit. International Trade Secretary <mark>Liam Fox</mark> has refused to rule himself out as a Tory leadership candidate. Asked if he would stand, Dr <mark>Fox</mark> told the BBC:\" Well, I don't think it's likely to happen, but, as you say, it's an unusual contest. \"Dr <mark>Fox</mark> said:\" It is best for us to leave with an agreement. \"But, I think that it is possible, and probably increasingly likely now, that we could leave without a deal because I think there's a limited patience from the European Union with Britain's constant delay .\" Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who has said she will not stand for the top job, told the BBC: \"I would be very concerned about somebody who is too enthusiastic about no deal .\" It is very important that whoever takes this on looks for a solution and tries to work to find where the majority of the House (of Commons) is. \"More than a dozen Tories are understood to be considering a bid, with Foreign Secretary <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> indicating he will be in the race and former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey putting herself forward\" as a future leader \". (PA Graphics) The new Tory leader looks set to take over as prime minister at the end of July after Mrs <mark>May</mark> finally laid out a timetable for her exit from Downing Street. The timetable for the contest will see nominations close in the week of June 10, with MPs involved in a series of votes to whittle down what is set to be a crowded field to a final two contenders. Tory party members will then decide who wins the run-off. Hosting a radio call-in on LBC, Ms McVey said:\" I'll put my hands up here, I better declare an interest straight away. I have put myself forward as a future leader. \"And Sir Graham Brady quit as the leader of the 1922 Committee--a position which gave him a significant role in the Prime Minister's departure--in order to consider a leadership bid.

2:48 AM Loading...TIPPING OFF: Wofford, Murray State aim for big March moment RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - The first teams will earn their spot in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16 on Saturday - and the upstarts are right there near the front of the line. There are eight double-digit seeds left in the field of 32 entering the second round, three of those coming from outside the power conferences: No. 12 seeds Murray State and Liberty, and No. 13 UC Irvine. And then there's Wofford, the headliner in a batch of schools aiming to make their own enduring March Madness moment with a marquee matchup against Kentucky. That game comes Saturday in the Midwest Region, along with Murray State's date with Florida State in the West bracket in an eight-game schedule. And make no mistake: there's plenty of belief for a pair of teams that haven't lost a game in months. \"You don't want to get out of character and try to do things that you can't do or do things that you're uncomfortable doing just to try to show that you can do something,\" Wofford guard Fletcher Magee said. \"We want to stay within ourselves, play our game, and we feel that if we do that, we can be right there and we can compete with them .\" Murray State (28-4) rolled in its first-round game behind Ja Morant, who had a hello-national-audience performance with 17 points, 16 assists and 11 rebounds in a rout of fifth-seeded Marquette. That was the Racers' 12th straight win. They haven't lost since falling to Jacksonville State on Jan. 31. Morant (24.4 points, 5.7 rebounds) leads the country with 10.2 assists per game, and the Racers have three other double-figure scorers. The biggest challenge will be handling Florida State's size and length. \"We know Ja will get all of the attention,\" said Shaq Buchanan, averages 13.1 points. \"Like, it's amazing, but at the same time, we know how to handle that. And we know everybody's going to be keyed in on him (Saturday), so we just going to make plays for him like we did against Marquette .\" As for Wofford, the seventh-seeded Terriers (30-4) have been a popular pick. All four losses came against power-conference teams that made the NCAA Tournament and they have won 21 straight games since falling to Mississippi State on Dec. 19. The Southern Conference champions, who rolled past Seton Hall in the first round, entered the tournament ranked No. 13 in the NCAA's new NET rankings - ahead of names like LSU, Auburn and Kansas - after claiming their first AP Top 25 ranking in program history. Behind Magee's incredible shot-making ability, the Terriers rank ninth in KenPom's adjusted offensive efficiency (118.8 points per 100 possessions). They're facing a second-seeded Kentucky team missing leading scorer and rebounder PJ Washington due to a foot sprain. \"I can't imagine a team more confident, and that's earned,\" Wofford coach <mark>Mike Young</mark> said, adding: \"They may whip our tail, but it will not be because my kids are scared. They'll come out ready to fight .\" Here are some of the other storylines for Saturday's schedule: TILLIE'S HEALTH Gonzaga has been waiting for Killian Tillie to look healthy. The 6-foot-10 junior had a season-high 17 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the first-round rout of Fairleigh Dickinson for the top-seeded Zags, who face No. 9 seed Baylor in the West Region. Tillie had been sidelined into January with a foot injury, then reinjured his foot and didn't return until the West Coast Conference Tournament. Now he's another weapon for a team that leads KenPom's adjusted offensive efficiency rankings (125.4 points per 100 possessions). \"It makes us much more versatile,\" Zags coach Mark Few said, adding: \"He's got an incredible feel for the game and basketball intuition .\" CHAMPS IN ACTION It's been a while since reigning national champion Villanova was a lower seed playing to pull an upset. The sixth-seeded Wildcats face No. 3 seed Purdue in the South Region's only game Saturday and they are 3 1/2 - point underdogs. It will be the first time the Wildcats have played a higher seed before the Final Four since beating top-seeded Kansas in a 2016 regional final on the way to coach <mark>Jay Wright</mark>'s first national championship. Villanova had been a No. 1 or No. 2 seed for five straight tournaments. BIG TEN BATTLE It's not ideal, but the Big Ten has a second-round East Region matchup with No. 2 seed Michigan State and 10th-seeded Minnesota. The Spartans won the only meeting in February, and the rematch will cost the Big Ten one of its seven teams still alive in the tournament. \"However the NCAA Tournament does the seeds and the matchup is how they do it,\" Minnesota's Amir Coffey said. \"We have no control over that. We just have to be ready for whoever we are matched up against .\" THE REST OF THE SCHEDULE The schedule includes another 2-vs-10 matchup in the West with Michigan against Florida, respectively. In the East, third-seeded LSU meets sixth-seeded Maryland. And in the Midwest, there's an intriguing matchup between fourth-seeded Kansas and fifth-seeded Auburn - two teams that have experienced wild swings in their seasons. Kansas was preseason No. 1 in the AP Top 25 yet dealt with a series of injuries and off-court issues that have left coach Bill Self with a very different roster. Meanwhile, Auburn peaked at No. 7 in December, fell out of the rankings, then made a late-season surge to win the Southeastern Conference Tournament. ___ Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http: //www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap ___ More AP college basketball: https: //apnews.com/MarchMadness and http: //www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Justin Sellers, The Clarion-Ledger) If three is officially a trend, chalking is now a trendy--and highly controversial--way for <mark>Donald Trump</mark> fans to show their love. This week, two schools--the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga--jumped into the chalking fray, joining the headlines made in March at Emory University with pro-Trump messages scrawled on campus grounds. Following a now-familiar timeline, the chalked messages appeared and the storms followed. At UTC, it hit the student government. Hailey Puckett, a member of a UTC student government coalition called Empower UTC who chalked \"<mark>Trump</mark> 2016\" on April 5, was asked to resign by fellow coalition members. pic.twitter.com/qjcJUAvRuO--EMPOWER UTC (@ EMPOWER_UTC) April 6, 2016 Empower' s stance did not go over well with some students, who responded along the lines of this tweet.

Stubblefield noted that his words had been poorly chosen. \"I fully support every individual' s First Amendment rights and the senator-elect has every right to support any candidate of her choosing,\" he wrote. I feel that I have to express my honest opinions and that I have to represent all students. pic.twitter.com/m7JxhpM3HF--Phillip Stubblefield (@ EMPOWERPhillip) April 6, 2016 Long apologized and noted that \"Hailey was asked by EMPOWER to resign from SGA because she disregarded her responsibility as an elected senator to represent the students that elected her. Her statement,\" Super proud of our art work, but I have a feeling half of UTCs campus is going to hate it' does not show that she is currently prepared to represent students effectively. That is the sole reason we asked her to resign. \"Regarding recent events: pic.twitter.com/xITD8o1SxH--Mikayla Long (@ mikaylasheaIong) April 6, 2016 Puckett' s message was later washed off by students who then chalked the message,\" Black UTC supports unity \"in its place, reports student newspaper The University Echo. Since, then, the newspaper says, other messages have been chalked, ranging from\" Power C 4 <mark>Trump</mark>, \"to\" UTC supports Hailey, \"\"UTC supports Black UTC\" to a \"<mark>Trump</mark> 2016 .\" The school has released a statement saying in part, \"Diversity--including diversity of thought--is a core value of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. This idea was put to the test when a question of free speech developed between several groups of students ....The heated dialogue that resulted was unfortunate but serves as a teachable moment for our students and the incoming student government leadership .\" The UTC administration has not played a role in this debate. \"Also on April 5, chalk messages were written on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. They included,\" They have to go back #Trump, \"\"Build the Wall\" and \"<mark>Trump</mark> Deportation Force .\" The messages appeared near the campus' Latina/Latino Studies building. In an email sent to the school community and obtained by USA TODAY College, the school said in part, \"We value discourse while also recognizing that offensive speech is protected by the First Amendment. The best recourse to speech with which we disagree is more speech .\" In a statement to the campus, Jonathan Inda, chair of the Department of Latina/Latino Studies, called the chalking \"unacceptable .\" \"It is no coincidence that a\" <mark>Trump</mark>' message was scrawled in front of the Department of Latino/Latina Studies building. Such a message was not intended to advance political dialogue, but to psychologically wound, breed intolerance, and create an atmosphere of insecurity for Latina/os on campus, \"he said. At Emory, students claimed they were\" in pain \"after seeing\" <mark>Trump</mark> 2016 \"tagged on campus.

Please refer to the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and the tables within this press release which contain explanations and reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures. Recent Business Highlights Ping Identity recently secured a notable customer win with a large global entertainment and ticketing platform, which purchased and is implementing Ping Identity's hybrid cloud platform to replace a homegrown solution. This is a core part of the enterprise's digital transformation strategy to establish a more personalized relationship with their customers and a better user experience for event access. Ping Identity closed the largest PingIntelligence for APIs deal in company history at over $500,000 in ARR, driving further innovation around API security. The Company's industry leadership and accomplishments have been validated recently by the likes of Gartner, KuppingerCole, InfoSec, and CRN. For example, Ping Identity currently scores 92% on \"Willingness to Recommend' by Gartner Peer Insights and was positioned as a Leader in Gartner's August 2019 Magic Quadrant for Access Management. Ping Identity hosted Identify conferences in Chicago, New York, Europe and Asia Pacific, and announced the launch of PingCentral to help customers automate centralized identity services. Ping Identity is now a NYSE-listed company (ticker symbol: PING) after completing its IPO on September 19, raising $187.5 million. The majority of net proceeds were subsequently used to pay down debt .\" We are pleased with our strong third quarter performance, driven by our continued leadership position in the enterprise market due to the flexibility of our platform and our ability to address multi-generational IT realities, \"stated Raj Dani, Chief Financial Officer of Ping Identity .\" Total ARR grew 23% versus the prior year period, which we believe provides the best representation of the underlying health of the business. We've also been able to effectively balance our commitment to invest in growth and innovation with profitability by delivering operating efficiencies that have resulted in a net loss improvement from $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2018 to a net loss of $0.6 million this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 22% in the quarter, and year-to-date cash flows from operations as well as Unlevered Free Cash Flow were positive. We believe there are significant whitespace opportunities within our existing customer base by adding identities and use cases and selling new solutions, as we further penetrate an overall $25 billion market opportunity for Identity Access Management software and hybrid cloud solutions. \"Fourth Quarter Financial Outlook Ping Identity provides the following expected financial guidance for the quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2019: Quarter Ending December 31, 2019: Total ARR of $222.1 million to $223.1 million Total Revenue of $64.7 million to $66.7 million Unlevered Free Cash Flow of $(11.9) million to $(10.8) million Year Ending December 31, 2019: Total ARR of $222.1 million to $223.1 million Total Revenue of $239.3 million to $241.3 million Unlevered Free Cash Flow of $(3.8) million to $(2.7) million, inclusive of contingent deal consideration in the amount of $4.9 million Conference Call Details In conjunction with this announcement, Ping Identity will host a conference call today, November 13, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.
