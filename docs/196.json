when does equality come into play?\" asked laura scott, 43, of columbia, md. the doma argument follows tuesday's case over california's ban on same-sex marriage, a case in which the justices indicated they might avoid a major national ruling on whether america's gays and lesbians have a right to marry. even without a significant ruling, the court appeared headed for a resolution that would mean the resumption of gay and lesbian weddings in california. marital status is relevant in more than 1,100 federal laws that include estate taxes, social security survivor benefits and health benefits for federal employees. lawsuits around the country have led four federal district courts and two appeals courts to strike down the law's section 3, which defines marriage. in 2011, the obama administration abandoned its defense of the law but continues to enforce it. house republicans are now defending doma in the courts. same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the district of columbia. the states are connecticut, iowa, maine, maryland, massachusetts, new hampshire, new york, vermont and washington. it also was legal in california for less than five months in 2008. the justices chose for their review the case of edith windsor, 83, of new york, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009. windsor, who goes by edie, married thea spyer in 2007 in canada after doctors told them that spyer would not live much longer. she suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years. spyer left everything she had to windsor. there is no dispute that if windsor had been married to a man, her estate tax bill would have been zero. the u.s. 2nd circuit court of appeals in new york agreed with a district judge that the provision of doma deprived windsor of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law. like the proposition 8 case from california, windsor's lawsuit could falter on a legal technicality without a definitive ruling from the high court. the house republicans, the obama administration and a lawyer appointed by the court especially to argue the issue were to spend the first 50 minutes wednesday discussing whether the house republican leadership can defend the law in court because the administration decided not to, and whether the administration forfeited its right to participate in the case because it changed its position and now argues that the provision is unconstitutional. if the supreme court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, windsor probably would still get her refund because she won in the lower courts. but there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books. on tuesday, the justices weighed a fundamental issue: does the constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender? the fact that the question was in front of the supreme court at all was startling, given that no state recognized same-sex unions before 2003 and 40 states still don't allow them. but it was clear from the start of the 80-minute argument in a packed courtroom that the justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, had doubts about whether they should even be hearing the challenge to california's proposition 8, the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban. justice <mark>anthony kennedy</mark>, the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court, suggested the justices could dismiss the case with no ruling at all. such an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in california but would have no impact elsewhere. there was no majority apparent for any particular outcome, and many doubts were expressed by justices about the arguments advanced by lawyers for the opponents of gay marriage in california, by the supporters and by the obama administration, which is in favor of same-sex marriage rights. the administration's entry into the case followed president barack obama's declaration of support for gay marriage. on the one hand, <mark>kennedy</mark> acknowledged that same-sex unions had only become legal recently in some states, a point stressed repeatedly by <mark>charles cooper</mark>, the lawyer for the defenders of proposition 8. <mark>cooper</mark> said the court should uphold the ban as a valid expression of the people's will and let the vigorous political debate over gay marriage continue. but <mark>kennedy</mark> pressed him also to address the interests of the estimated 40,000 children in california who have same-sex parents. \"they want their parents to have full recognition and full status,\" <mark>kennedy</mark> said. \"the voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?\" yet when theodore olson, the lawyer for two same-sex couples, urged the court to support such marriage rights everywhere, <mark>kennedy</mark> feared such a ruling would push the court into \"uncharted waters .\" olson said the court similarly ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down bans on interracial marriage in 16 states. <mark>kennedy</mark> challenged the accuracy of that comment: he noted that other countries had had interracial marriages for hundreds of years. the justice also made clear he did not like the rationale of the federal appeals court that struck down proposition 8, even though it cited earlier opinions in favor of gay rights that <mark>kennedy</mark> had written. that appeals court ruling applied only to california, where same-sex couples briefly had the right to marry before the state's voters in november 2008 adopted proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman.", "articleID": "2013032717_00039196_W", "names": {"Paul Clement": ["Q1356377", "Q15708728"]}}, {"date": "2013-03-28", "url": "http://craveonline.com/tv/articles/470043-donut-showdown-comes-to-food-network-canada?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=donut-showdown-comes-to-food-network-canada", "content": "/ \"donut showdown\" comes to food network canada \"donut showdown\" comes to food network canada a new series on the food network canada has taken the station by storm - \"donut showdown\" is a tasty program that turns donuts into cold hard cash. in each episode three of the best donut makers from across north america test their creativity and must come up with a batch of donuts that includes three surprise ingredients. the show's three expert judges (chef david rocco, chef maggie mckeown, and restauranteur zane caplansky) sample and then send one of the donut makers home. the remaining two contenders then prepare a monster batch of donuts that are based on a theme dictated by the judges to determine who will be the week's winner of $10,000. \"tums! well once you eat, like, 100 doughnuts. or a treadmill, maybe,\" mckeown said on wednesday of her new favourite post-judging snack (as reported by the canadian press). \"i've got to tell you, that part was not easy. by the end of it i was like,\" oh my god, no more doughnuts!' \"she added,\" i think doughnuts are popular because it's a food everybody can relate to. it's a food that every part of the world has some version of?

away too much plot, the movie moves on from luke's story to avery's--hailed as a hero cop, he suffers from self-doubt--and then, in its final section, to what happens when the teenage sons (dane dehaan and emory cohen) of the two men meet. the boys both bear the scars of having been raised, for differing reasons, with absent fathers, and an antagonism develops between them. only the luke

morning call the berks jazz fest, which opens friday april 5 for its 23 r d year, has always been about entertainment. but audiences this year also might learn more than ever about the distinctly american musical genre from the nearly 140 performances in the festival's 10 days at major venues, clubs and restaurants throughout the reading area. some of that education will come just from listening. the effects jazz has had on other styles will be evident in programs that offer jazz mixed with rock, funk, blues, latin, pop and gospel. salutes to artists such as steely dan will further drive home that concept. festival headliner esperanza spalding, the only jazz artist to win the grammy award for best new artist, will give listeners a schooling in the rising popularity of traditional jazz when she plays april 9 at reading's scottish rite cathedral. the bassist/singer has been a music educator herself. if you want more formal education, there are workshops and master classes. new this year is get jazzed, an educational series that offers a mix of live performances, workshops and film at goggleworks center for the arts in downtown reading. \"we do a lot with education every year but our education committee really put together a comprehensive program,\" says festival general manager john ernesto. the 2013 festival is part of the smithsonian institute's national jazz appreciation month celebration. as always, the fest offers an impressive lineup that includes six 2013 grammy nominees. in all, the fest will feature 44 headline concerts with tickets costing $15 - $48, and nearly 100 free performances. organizers have expanded the boundaries of the fest. smooth jazz trumpet player and multi-instrumentalist rick braun, an allentown native, played a preview of his fest appearances at musikfest cafe in bethlehem on march 30 - his first public lehigh valley show ever. braun will play three shows at the fest - he's part of berks bop iii on april 10 and the all-star jazz jam on april 11, both at crowne plaza reading, and the jazz attack on april 12 at scottish rite cathedral. after the fest, blues-jam-rock group tedeschi trucks band, featuring allman brothers guitarist derek trucks and his wife susan tedeschi, will play an april 28 show at reading's sovereign center under the umbrella of the festival. after a preview night thursday, april 4 featuring concerts at kutztown university and the reading public museum, the fest officially opens friday, april 5 with a concert by dianne reeves, the only singer to win the grammy award for best jazz vocal performance for three consecutive albums (she's won four grammys overall), at sovereign performing arts center. the show also will mark the 100th anniversary season of reading symphony orchestra, which will back reeves. \"i'm really excited about opening night,\" ernesto says. \"there's no one better than dianne. man, she's an amazing jazz singer, and a singer, period - four-time grammy winner .\" adding the reading symphony anniversary celebration will be a \"great way to kick off the festival,\" he says. the festival has tried to get spalding to play in reading since she beat justin bieber for the best new artist grammy, ernesto says. \"we could never get her schedule to match up with the festival,\" he says. the festival is slightly later this year, pushing it into the path of the east coast leg of spalding's tour. ernesto says because easter is early this year, the fest \"made the decision to go after easter; not push the festival too far up into march .\" that decision was serendipitous for the fest's focus on education, ernesto says. it put the entire festival in april, which happens to be the smithsonian institute's national jazz appreciation month. so the festival applied for and got the smithsonian's official designation. \"we wanted to really take advantage of that and be part of that whole program,\" ernesto says. \"it's kind of neat, and it's really good because it ties in with a lot of the educational stuff that we do .\" for the get jazzed series, ernesto says, the fest rented the 120-seat goggleworks theatre for seven days. all the programs but one are free. wynton marsalis and eric clapton play the blues, \"followed by local blues band lil' ragu and the blues all-stars. the blues all stars are part of the festival's berks jazz jam, where young musicians play with the pros. on saturday, british guitar legend <mark>martin taylor</mark> will off the series' only paid-attendance event, a workshop and concert, followed by free

hollywood movies have already begun catering to a growing chinese audience. most recently, the makers behind the anticipated third-installment of the marvel superhero series \"iron man,\" which was partially shot in china, announced that a different version of the film will be released, and it will differ from what audiences outside of china will see. the chinese version of the trailer, which can be seen above, also differs from the movie's american trailers, as it more prominently features chinese actors and settings. typically, when china releases its own version of a hollywood movie, it means the film did not pass the sometimes-arbitrary standards of the nation's media censorship group, the state administration of radio, film and television, which is this time, however, legendary comic book company marvel is behind the decision to create the special china-version of \"iron man 3,\" starring robert downey jr. in the title role. according to the diplomat, chinese actress fan bingbing will be in the chinese version of the movie, but her scenes will be cut from all non-chinese showings. but marvel explained that chinese audiences can expect more than just fan bingbing. \"the chinese version of the film will also feature a special appearance of china's top actress, fan bingbing, and will offer specially prepared bonus footage exclusively for the chinese audience,\" the company noted. in addition, chinese actor wang xueqi will be featured in both versions of the movie. the production of \"iron man 3\" has received a lot of international attention for its friendly involvement with chinese authorities while filming and for its use of chinese actors. \"marvel studios' experience working on this film with fan bingbing and wang xueqi and in shooting in china has been very positive and has created a springboard for future collaboration with china's talented stars and its growing film and television industry,\" marvel said. marvel isn't the only entertainment

the film, keeping in mind a major audience: china. the wrap, paramount decided to alter a minor plot detail, changing the geographic origin of an outbreak that eventually caused the zombie apocalypse from china to a different location. while paramount executives say that the plot does not hinge on china being the origin, they made the change to be conscious of the fast-growing chinese market, and the state censorship that would have likely carried out the the change for them. just yesterday, paramount announced that the making of another potential blockbuster, \"transformers 4,\" will involve

(ap) - a sheriff known for cracking down on the drug trade in southern west virginia's coalfields was fatally shot wednesday in the spot where he usually parked his car for lunch, a state official said, and a suspect was in custody. state police told gov. earl ray tomblin that mingo county sheriff eugene crum died of his wounds, said his chief of staff rob alsop. state police spokesman sgt. michael baylous identified the suspect as 37-year-old tennis melvin maynard and said he was being treated at cabell huntington hospital in huntington for gunshot wounds late wednesday. baylous said the suspect's condition was unknown, but maynard was shot by a sheriff's deputy after a short pursuit in delbarton that ended with maynard crashing his car. the shooting was blocks from the county courthouse that was evacuated after the shooting. streets into the city were temporarily blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, crum's body further shielded by two vehicles. though there is no indication of any direct connection, crum's killing comes on the heels of a texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and just weeks after colorado's corrections director also was gunned down at his home. delegate harry keith white, who campaigned with crum last year, said his friend was shot to death in the same place where he parked his car most days to eat lunch, near the site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills. \"i think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,\" white said. \"it's just a sad, sad day for mingo county and the state of west virginia. soon after he took office this year, crum led a drug task force and an initiative called operation zero tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, white said. state, federal and local authorities have all tried to crack down on west virginia's drug problem, which centers on the illegal sale of prescription drugs in the southern counties. mingo county is in the southwest corner of west virginia, on the border with kentucky. the centers for disease control and prevention says west virginia has the second-highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the nation. and in february, the u.s. attorney's office said it had prosecuted more than 200 pill dealers in the past two years. kenneth jude, 23, of chatteroy, has known crum his whole life and believes he was targeted because of his crusade .\" they shouldn't scare cops into not wanting to do their jobs, \"he said .\" it's people like that that give this place a bad name - somebody that would do something that stupid, to kill somebody that's trying to make it a better place, \"jude said .\" you wouldn't think something like that would happen, especially in the middle of town. \"jerry cline stood near the site of crum's slaying hours later, recalling how crum watched the traffic and the community but\" never messed with nobody unless they were violating the law. \"authorities have not said whether the shooting was related to crum's drug crackdown, but it was on cline's mind .\" he told them right before he got in as sheriff, \"if you're dealing drugs, i'm coming after you. i'm cleaning this town up,'\" cline said. \"? he got out just to do one thing, and that's the clean this town up. that's all that man tried to do .\" cline's wife, loretta, said the sheriff was a good friend to everyone, even those who barely knew him. \"once you meet him one time, it's like you've known him all your life,\" she said. \"every time you'd see him, he was always the same. he always had a smile on his face. he was a very loving person .\" crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, white said. he won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall. crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in delbarton. delegate justin marcum, d-mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called crum \"a true friend to the county .\" \"he'll be dearly missed,\" he said. williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the tug fork river in a part of the state long associated with violence. mingo and neighboring mcdowell county are home to the legendary blood feud between the hatfield family of west virginia and the mccoy family of kentucky, a conflict dating to the civil war. crum's county was dubbed \"bloody mingo\" during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled baldwin-felts security agents hired by the coal operators. in may 1920, after evicting striking miners in red jacket, some of the baldwin-felts men tried to board a train in nearby matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, sid hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the hatfields in the feud. after a gun battle recreated in the 1987 john sayles film \"matewan,\" the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in matewan. in the slayings of the texas district attorney and his wife, officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. those killings happened a couple of months after one of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office. over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the national district attorneys association. at least eight of them were targeted in the line of duty. colorado's corrections director, <mark>tom clements</mark>, was killed march 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside colorado springs. two days later, evan spencer ebel, a white supremacist and former colorado inmate suspected of shooting <mark>clements</mark>, died in a shootout about 100 miles from kaufman. u.s. attorney booth goodwin called crum's killing \"shocking\" and said he's spoken to the state police, which will lead the investigation. he pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed. the officer down memorial page says 197 police officers in west virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from

midwest regional final win over duke last sunday. his mother said saturday at the final four that the public response to his misfortune could require some dental care. baked goods, homemade brownies and cookies and fruit baskets have arrived en masse, so many that <mark>ware</mark> will need help consuming them. \"while he's resting, he should be gaining a lot of weight,\" said lisa junior, <mark>ware</mark>'s mother. \"not only are we going to have to watch his leg, we're going to have to take him to the dentist .\" junior was sitting in the louisville courtside in the parents section at the georgia dome, the climax of a week that saw nationwide attention and even an international apparel company focused on her son, a cardinals sophomore. many members of the media and fans saw \"ri5e to the occasion\" t-shirts as another example of greed in college sports, where schools and shoe companies make money on the backs of student-athletes. one noteworthy person didn't??? his mother. the shirts used a familiar slogan with <mark>ware</mark>'s number inserted, but it was almost universally derided as exploiting the reserve guard's injury. junior saw it as a rare negative moment in a week of positives. \"i felt that there were so many other things going on at the time, to make it an issue when so much positiveness was coming out of it was meaningless,\" she said at halftime of the cardinals' national semifinal game vs. wichita state. \"it was sad that the media portrayed it as louisville trying to take advantage of the situation .\" <mark>ware</mark> suffered a compound fracture when trying to block a 3-pointer against duke. his lower leg collapsed as he landed, his bone protruding through his skin. yet it was <mark>ware</mark>'s message to his weeping teammates that helped louisville rally to defeat duke. win the game, he told them. get <mark>kevin</mark> home, coach rick pitino instructed his players who would need to win to get <mark>ware</mark> close to his home outside of atlanta. it was a rare injury and moving response played out on live television, making <mark>ware</mark> an overnight celebrity. shortly after, the shirts followed. schools with adidas contracts had worn \"rise to the occasion\" shirts throughout the postseason. with <mark>ware</mark>'s number inserted, the shirts went on sale early this week on louisville's website for $24.99. the school and adidas were criticized for seemingly trying to profit off <mark>ware</mark>'s misfortune while ncaa rules prohibit him from receiving any of that money. some of the cardinals players agreed. louisville announced that it had waived royalties for the shirts before adidas told usa today sports on friday that it had halted sales of the item. junior said the shirts would have been a way for fans to support <mark>ware</mark>, who became the story of the tournament this week. she never doubted the intentions of louisville officials. \"he works for louisville after all,\" she said. junior described this week as \"chaotic,\" a blitz of interviews and television appearances, including reading david letterman's \"top ten,\" after <mark>ware</mark> had surgery on sunday night to repair the leg. <mark>ware</mark> has not been to class as he remained in an indianapolis hospital until tuesday before going to louisville and proceeding on to atlanta. \"we had no idea this was going to blow up the way that it did,\" junior said. phone calls of support came from everywhere. <mark>charles barkley</mark>, <mark>magic johnson</mark> and rev. jesse jackson all called. so did first lady michelle obama, whom junior said was her idol. \"he was sedated, so he didn't remember the phone call,\" she said. once the season ends, junior knows the attention will fade. she said she'll help <mark>ware</mark> get settled back in at louisville and visit as often as she can. he has a long recovery to get back to basketball, but seeing him apply life lessons this week makes her believe he can return. for now, she has enjoyed the outpouring of support. signs throughout the stands at the georgia dome read, \"win for <mark>ware</mark>.\" amar' e stoudemire paid for
