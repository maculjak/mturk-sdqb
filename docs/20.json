gotten the recognition deserving of his production is end jeremy beal. sure, beal was a second-team all-big 12 selection a year ago, but he was in the shadows of players such as texas' brian orakpo and teammate auston english most of last season. but heading into 2009, beal could be a breakout force after logging nine sacks a year ago. \"i expect him to be an all-american,\" defensive ends coach <mark>chris wilson</mark> said. \"that's his expectation and i have the same expectation .\" beal's all-america candidacy will likely be boosted by the ways ou plans to use the former high school linebacker next season. beal was already a part of a special goal-line package the sooners incorporated into their game plan last season. beal served as a stand-up linebacker in certain situations, and <mark>wilson</mark> said that role is expected to expand. \"he gives us a lot of versatility,\" he said. \"being a former linebacker he can drop, he can rush off the edge, he can get into run fits and play\" backer for us sometimes. he'll be a guy that we'll form some really neat packages around as we get ready to go into the fall. \"the defensive end position will be deep once again for the sooners. english, a 2008 preseason defensive player of the year candidate, should return to full strength next season. english missed several games after undergoing an emergency appendectomy before the start of the '08 season. then he suffered a leg injury against nebraska that limited his availability the rest of the year. but there are no concerns about english's production after a down year last season .\" i can say this without a doubt that he's our starter, \"<mark>wilson</mark> said .\" unless something tragic happens he'll be the guy that starts our first game at byu. \"frank alexander also returns as he'll try and build on an impressive redshirt freshman season in' 08. this spring has been a springboard for alexander to develop at the position. there are high expectations for alexander as spring practice is winding down .\" he's been doing everything on his competitive nature and his athleticism, \"<mark>wilson</mark> said .\" we've got to get him more disciplined and more technically sound and more fundamentally sound. those are the things, when you get down to it, are the things that let you beat texas or florida and obviously that's our goal every year. \"r.j. washington is also vying for playing time. as of today, he wouldn't be in the sooners' four-man rotation. that fourth spot would belong to <mark>david king</mark>.\" <mark>david king</mark>'s really matured a lot. obviously they're as raw as you can get right now, but <mark>david</mark>'s improved and i really like his upside, \"<mark>wilson</mark> said. washington has the type of talent coaches

be a burglary gone wrong, but when the only masked vigilanty that has not retired or sponsered by the government, rorshach, investigates his death, he not only finds the truth, but a conspiracy that will change the world forever. the world is also on the brink of doomsday. the two superpowers (usa and the ussr) are comming closer and closer to nuclear war. the doomsday clock is at 11:55 and moving closer and closer to midnight. is someone killing off masked vigilanties? if so, why? is it to stop them from preventing wwiii? is it revenge from an old advasary? and who is next? insights: after reading the book, one will like this adaptaion. it is basically taking the whole book and putting together each frame and turning it into an animated film. it is cool, and it does the entire book including tales of the black frieghter. however, it cuts out some of the interstial chapters after each chapter of the book where they put in segments from hollis mason's book under the hood, the newspaper articles, walter kovacks' police file, letters, and interviews with the characters, etc. and also some little tid bits like rorshach's opening monolouge is cut down. it ends at \"and i'll look down and whisper\" no .' \". sucks, but tolerable. also, the entire film is narrated and performed by one guy. tom stechschulte (all is normal, the manchurian candidate, fields of freedom). he does a good job, it just takes some getting use to. it is like a book on audio cd with visuals in a way with music and sound effects. all in all for a watchmen fan you only get 99% of the watchmen experience with this. but worth it. the theatrical cut story: same exact story, just with a better budget and cast list. click link to see. insights: to start with, everyone was perfectly casted. all was just perfect for a film adaptaion. just can't waith for the director's / extended cut dvd to come out. with this cut of the film you olny get maybe 70% -85% of the watchmen experience. but well worth it. black freighter story: a captian's ship is destroyed by the mysterious black freighter and is left to die. on a deserted island, the captian begins to stir and believes the black freighter is heading for his home in david's town. he creates a raft out of palmtrees and the dead bodies of his shipmates and travels across the ocean in hopes of getting there in time to save his loved ones and his home town before the black freighter slaughters them all. but will he? before the sea drives him mad? insights: a perfect adaptaion of the comic within the comic. with gerard butler (300, the phantom of the opera, timeline) as the captian delivering a perfect voice performance and beautifull animation. rate: * * * under the hood story: a tv show looks back on a segment they did in '75 about hollis mason's book under the hood and reshow it featuring interviews with mason, stephen mchattie (you might as well live, 300, twist), and several other members of the minutemen and their nemesis'. insights: a very well put together documentary about the first group of masked vigilanties with the actors from the film playing their parts for this. it was a cool way to do under the hood. rate * * * 1/2 incase you haven't read my review for the book, here it is: twelve minutes to midnight: a review of the graphic novel watchmen--today in movies--8/25/08 accomplished category: movies, tv, celebrities. . note: i am well aware the film adaptaion of this graphic novel is not out yet and that i am reviewing a graphic novel. but however, since this book is written and drawn like a film, i have decided to review it like one. nuf said. today's review is of the graphic novel: story: the comedian is dead. murdered. and the only masked adventurer who has not retired, rorschach, investigates the murder and begins to uncover more than expected. and also the world is on the brink of doomsday. the world is on the threat of nuclear anialation from both the american and soviet governments. is the comedian's death connected in some way? or is it a coincedence? or something more? who killed him and why? is someone killing all the maked adventurers? if so, who's next? and once all is solved, it will not only change those involved, but the whole world intirely. insihgts: the one this to say about this graphic novel is perfect. this is the best graphic novel i have ever read. a must read. <mark>alan moore</mark> and dave gibbons are geniuses. the realease of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking...the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. if only i had known, i should have become a watchmaker. - albert einstein now that i have said all that, with all the comic book films comming out this year and next, i think the one that is

"content": "mlk housing seeks assistance from city by john larson burdened by a parcel of land it does not need and resources spent on a homeless shelter it no longer operates, martin luther king housing development association (mlkhda) finds itself in a bind. the non-profit organization is hoping to get help from the city of tacoma. executive director felix flannigan discussed his agency's problems and proposed a possible solution during tacoma city council's economic development committee meeting on april 14. in 2005 the agency purchased property on south 48th street near tacoma mall, with the intention of building 110 units of housing for low-income individuals. at the time the property was worth $980,000. a recent appraisal set its value at $590,000. as part of the purchase, mlkhda used its charlesbee apartments on south \"g' street on hilltop as collateral. with the current downturn in the economy, that 39-unit complex is at risk of foreclosure and its 60 residents could soon find themselves out of their homes. flannigan discussed steps taken so far to address the agency's financial woes. staff has been cut from 42 to 16. those who remain no longer have benefits. in 2002 mlkhda was persuaded by community leaders to take over operation of the troubled king center homeless shelter. flannigan explained that human services was not his agency's forte, but took on the shelter anyway. it announced last year it wanted to shift away from this, and catholic community services recently took over operation. during the seven years his agency ran the shelter the economy was good, flannigan explained. it shifted about $1.5 million in revenue generated from other projects to the shelter, which he said has ended up causing it financial problems. he wants the city to purchase the property near the mall .\" we never view the city as a lender. we view it as a partner, \"he said. the agency wants to concentrate on its effort to build a mixed-use project on hilltop, which it expects would generate revenue needed to make it financially stable over the long term. the plan he proposed would have the city pay $1,250,000 to the lender to pay off the loan on the property, plus another $633,000 in working capital for mlkhda. the lender, according to flannigan,\" has been very flexible and they are hoping we can get this resolved. \"council members expressed support for the planned building on hilltop while sounding hesitant about the loan request. mayor bill baarsma said the city likely cannot come up with the amount of money the agency seeks. he noted that revenue from sales and business and occupation taxes are tanking, and real estate excise taxes are on shaky ground. the city may not have the money, he told flannigan. councilmember mike lonergan pondered whether the city could legally buy the property. councilmember lauren walker noted that mlkhda does not have all of the capital it needs to begin construction of the hilltop project. she suggested an independent third party examine the agency's finances. flannigan was agreeable to this .\" it might be helpful to have someone from the outside take a look at this, \"walker remarked. councilmember <mark>julie anderson</mark> noted that mlkhda's only collateral is apartment buildings. lonergan asked why the agency does not sell one of these. flannigan said finding a buyer is unlikely in the current economy .\" how do you sell anything in this market when the bands are not lending? \"<mark>brian ebersole</mark>, a former mayor now working with mlkhda, asked the council to help the agency, comparing the hilltop project to the museums that have breathed new life into downtown. the city assisted in those and other major projects, he noted .\" when you make something a priority it happens. \"\"this project is so exciting for the city of tacoma,\" said jack connelly, an attorney who sits on the agency's board. \"it is time to pull out all the stops and make this

request by the owners of the daily news and inquirer for permission to hire a law firm to investigate the unauthorized taping of a november meeting between the company and its creditors. but judge jean fitzsimon yesterday asked a committee of unsecured creditors to look into the incident, in which philadelphia newspapers ceo <mark>brian tierney</mark> discovered that vincent devito, an executive of the new york investment firm cit group, was recording the meeting. cit is among the senior lenders who hold the company's secured debt. it's the unsecured-creditors group that can now investigate the incident. according to participants at the november meeting, devito apologized and stopped taping after <mark>tierney</mark> told him that taping without permission is illegal in pennsylvania. <mark>tierney</mark> has since pressed for a further inquiry to determine if other meetings were taped and if confidential information might have been shared with others. \"we're very pleased that the judge agreed with us that this is a very serious matter that needs investigation,\" <mark>tierney</mark> said after a hearing yesterday in which he testified about the meeting. <mark>tierney</mark> said that after he made an issue of the taping in november, negotiations with the company's creditors took a sharp turn for the worse, and led to his decision to file for bankruptcy protection in february. creditors opposed <mark>tierney</mark>'s proposal to use company money to hire the law firm of elliott greenleaf & siedzikowski to investigate, and were pleased that fitzsimon denied the request. fitzsimon said that she wanted the company and its creditors to stay focused on resolving their financial issues, and said that the taping controversy could be \"one of
