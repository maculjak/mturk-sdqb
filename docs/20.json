JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print The head of the Senate Appropriations panel says that President Donald Trump is holding firm in his insistence on $5 billion for a border wall in a year-end spending package, a demand that risks blowing up negotiations and triggering a partial government shutdown. Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, has been working to find some middle ground between the House version of the spending bill that includes $5 billion for the wall and the $1.6 billion Republicans and Democrats on the Senate panel have proposed. Asked whether the $5 billion is a red line in the negotiations, Shelby said, \"for the president .\" He said he can't predict what will happen or whether Trump is looking at a confrontation with Democrats over the wall that leads to a partial shutdown as a political benefit. \"The president has to speak for himself,\" Shelby said. \"I'll just say that I don't think it's a good idea to shut the government down, period. But people are going to posture. And it could happen, it's happened before. But all the government won't be shut down, even if it is. I hope none of it shuts down .\" A pigeon flies near the border wall that separates Mexico, left, from the U.S., where the wall ends in the Pacific Ocean, seen from Tijuana, Mexico, Wednesday, Nov. 21, 2018. Ramon Espinosa/AP If lawmakers can't complete a handful of remaining spending bills by Dec. 7, funding will expire for several government departments, including Homeland Security and Justice. House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> and other members of the Republican leadership are scheduled to meet Tuesday with Trump at the White House to plan out the rest of the congressional term. Trump's position in the spending debate could harden further after his recent actions over the U.S. border with Mexico. They have included threatening to close it permanently in the wake of a confrontation between Central American migrants and Customs and Border Patrol agents at the busy San Ysidro port of entry between Tijuana and San Diego. The wall was clearly on the president's mind Monday when he appeared at a campaign rally in Tupelo, Mississippi, to support the candidacy of GOP Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who faces a runoff in her re-election bid Tuesday. \"We want to finish the wall. We've got to get funding from Congress,\" Trump said the rally. \"And if this isn't the right time to get funding, when you look at what's happening at the border, there will never be a right time. So we're going very strongly for funding for the wall .\" With assistance from <mark>Jack Fitzpatrick</mark>."}, {"articleID": "2018082605_00100578_W", "names": {"Sergio Gonzalez": ["Q28514300", "Q52162147", "Q56501664", "Q7454279"]}, "date": "2018-08-26", "url": "http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/uk-sports/2018/08/26/valverde-hits-out-at-state-of-pitch-after-barcelonas-victory-at-real-valladolid/", "content": "Valverde hits out at state of pitch after Barcelona's victory at Real Valladolid Less than an hour ago Barca secured a narrow win. Subscribe to our daily newsletter Sign UpErnesto Valverde was left unhappy Coach Ernesto Valverde has criticised the pitch at Real Valladolid after Barcelona scraped to a 1-0 victory. The players were seen struggling as the newly laid turf began cutting up during the match at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla, with Valverde saying he had not seen anything like it \"for a long time\". The Barca coach blamed the state of the surface for making it difficult for his players to launch a counter attack and find a second goal. Quoted on the club's official website, he said: \"Valladolid played with good pressure and they pushed us, but the pitch had a lot to do with it .\" We were more dominant and had opportunities, but we couldn't score the second goal. \"There was a time when they changed the system and we could've made it 0-2 then, but in the last few minutes we did badly .\" These results give us opportunities to win the league, but we feared that there could be some injury, the state of the pitch has conditioned both teams. \"Ousmane Dembele scored the only goal just before the hour in the hard-fought win, but the hosts would not lie down and almost snatched a last-gasp point.

all mason minnich could do was watch for the first 8:14 of saturday night's buckeye superstore/mcdonald's all-star football classic. the crestview running back spent the rest of the night making up for lost time and helping the north erase a 10-0 deficit after the south held the ball for nearly 12 of the first 16 minutes. minnich rang up 155 yards of total offense and scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the third quarter as the north rallied for a 21-10 victory at lexington high school to keep coach todd fox perfect in this all-star series. the loss spoiled a terrific start by the south and put a damper on head coach <mark>aaron cook</mark>'s 32nd birthday. on the plus side, <mark>cook</mark> saw two of his players at marion pleasant - jasone montgomery and tyler ferguson - take home most valuable defensive player and offensive lineman honors, respectively. \"we were most worried about their two quarterbacks,\" <mark>cook</mark> said, referring to buckeye central's tyler erwin and ashland's zach bernhard. \"they are two prolific quarterbacks who can create problems. the south held the ball for the first 8:14, driving 83 yards on 17 plays to take a 7-0 lead on mount gilead quarterback justin carver's 17-yard run. the lead increased to 10-0 when ontario's harry stickleman drilled a 32-yard field goal on the south's second possession, capping an eight-play, 65-yard drive. but after mustering 148 yards on its first two series, the south was limited to 68 yards the rest of the game. minnich, named offensive mvp, put the north in front to stay when he found the left pylon from six yards out to make it 14-10 with 2:56 left in the third quarter. it was poetic justice since minnich's two big plays in the first half went for naught. his 28-yard gain on a pitchout was wasted when the north missed a 26-yard field goal on the last play of the first quarter. on the north's first series in the second period, minnich was wide open down the left sideline for a 43-yard reception, but the drive fizzled at the 20 when he got stuffed on fourth-and-one .\" i had no idea i would get as many carries as i did, \"minnich said .\" as the quarters go on, i like getting the ball more and more, and i'm glad i got the opportunity. \"minnich, a division iii runner-up in the 100 meter dash at the state track meet three weeks ago, appeared to be in mid-season form even though the all-stars practiced for only four days .\" it's just like i said during track season, \"minnich said .\" football is never over with me, and (that attitude) paid off tonight. \"the north sealed the victory by ripping a page from the south's first quarter playbook. the north played keep-away in the fourth quarter, running 20 plays to the south's three over the first 10:29 of the final period. the kill shot was the 10-yard insurance score by plymouth running back tyler hicks on a 13-play, 58-yard drive that took 5:37 off the clock and left the south down two scores with only 1:31 to play. all-star classic: mount gilead qb carver scores south's only td in loss lexington -

Johnson - @ rickerthewriter - Just Now Beginning today (Thursday, August 1), terminally ill adults in the state of New Jersey will be allowed to ask their doctors for prescriptions for medication to help end their lives. The law goes into effect today after New Jersey Gov. <mark>Phil Murphy</mark> signed the Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act that was passed by lawmakers earlier this year. The bill allows for any patient who has a diagnosis of six months of fewer to live to request life-ending medication from the doctors. The law requires the patient undergo counseling by either a psychiatrist or psychologist in order to determine whether the patient has the mental capacity to make such a decision. If approved the patient can get a prescription of a series of self-administered pills that can be taken at home. \"Allowing residents with terminal illnesses to make end-of-life choices for themselves is the right thing to do,\" said Governor <mark>Murphy</mark> when he signed the bill in April. \"By signing this bill today, we are providing terminally ill patients and their families with the humanity, dignity, and respect that they so richly deserve at the most difficult times any of us will face .\" The bill has floated around the New Jersey legislature stretching back to 2014, but this was the first time it made it to the state Senate for a vote. It narrowly passed, with many concerned about its effects. Supporters on the other hand, including several terminally ill patients cheered the law when it was passed. \"Just having this option is a godsend that will enable me to live the rest of my life, however long it is, as fully as possible knowing I won't have to suffer needlessly at the end,\" said supporter Susan Boyce, a Rumson resident who has a terminal lung disease. Several other states in the U.S. allow physician-assisted suicide including: California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Montana, Colorado, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Another nineteen states are reportedly considering similar physician-assisted suicide bills.

(ap) - a sheriff known for cracking down on the drug trade in southern west virginia's coalfields was fatally shot wednesday in the spot where he usually parked his car for lunch, a state official said, and a suspect was in custody. state police told gov. earl ray tomblin that mingo county sheriff eugene crum died of his wounds, said his chief of staff rob alsop. state police spokesman sgt. michael baylous identified the suspect as 37-year-old tennis melvin maynard and said he was being treated at cabell huntington hospital in huntington for gunshot wounds late wednesday. baylous said the suspect's condition was unknown, but maynard was shot by a sheriff's deputy after a short pursuit in delbarton that ended with maynard crashing his car. the shooting was blocks from the county courthouse that was evacuated after the shooting. streets into the city were temporarily blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, crum's body further shielded by two vehicles. though there is no indication of any direct connection, crum's killing comes on the heels of a texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and just weeks after colorado's corrections director also was gunned down at his home. delegate harry keith white, who campaigned with crum last year, said his friend was shot to death in the same place where he parked his car most days to eat lunch, near the site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills. \"i think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,\" white said. \"it's just a sad, sad day for mingo county and the state of west virginia. soon after he took office this year, crum led a drug task force and an initiative called operation zero tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, white said. state, federal and local authorities have all tried to crack down on west virginia's drug problem, which centers on the illegal sale of prescription drugs in the southern counties. mingo county is in the southwest corner of west virginia, on the border with kentucky. the centers for disease control and prevention says west virginia has the second-highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the nation. and in february, the u.s. attorney's office said it had prosecuted more than 200 pill dealers in the past two years. kenneth jude, 23, of chatteroy, has known crum his whole life and believes he was targeted because of his crusade .\" they shouldn't scare cops into not wanting to do their jobs, \"he said .\" it's people like that that give this place a bad name - somebody that would do something that stupid, to kill somebody that's trying to make it a better place, \"jude said .\" you wouldn't think something like that would happen, especially in the middle of town. \"jerry cline stood near the site of crum's slaying hours later, recalling how crum watched the traffic and the community but\" never messed with nobody unless they were violating the law. \"authorities have not said whether the shooting was related to crum's drug crackdown, but it was on cline's mind .\" he told them right before he got in as sheriff, \"if you're dealing drugs, i'm coming after you. i'm cleaning this town up,'\" cline said. \"? he got out just to do one thing, and that's the clean this town up. that's all that man tried to do .\" cline's wife, loretta, said the sheriff was a good friend to everyone, even those who barely knew him. \"once you meet him one time, it's like you've known him all your life,\" she said. \"every time you'd see him, he was always the same. he always had a smile on his face. he was a very loving person .\" crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, white said. he won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall. crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in delbarton. delegate justin marcum, d-mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called crum \"a true friend to the county .\" \"he'll be dearly missed,\" he said. williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the tug fork river in a part of the state long associated with violence. mingo and neighboring mcdowell county are home to the legendary blood feud between the hatfield family of west virginia and the mccoy family of kentucky, a conflict dating to the civil war. crum's county was dubbed \"bloody mingo\" during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled baldwin-felts security agents hired by the coal operators. in may 1920, after evicting striking miners in red jacket, some of the baldwin-felts men tried to board a train in nearby matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, sid hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the hatfields in the feud. after a gun battle recreated in the 1987 john sayles film \"matewan,\" the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in matewan. in the slayings of the texas district attorney and his wife, officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. those killings happened a couple of months after one of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office. over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the national district attorneys association. at least eight of them were targeted in the line of duty. colorado's corrections director, <mark>tom clements</mark>, was killed march 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside colorado springs. two days later, evan spencer ebel, a white supremacist and former colorado inmate suspected of shooting <mark>clements</mark>, died in a shootout about 100 miles from kaufman. u.s. attorney booth goodwin called crum's killing \"shocking\" and said he's spoken to the state police, which will lead the investigation. he pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed. the officer down memorial page says 197 police officers in west virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from

by kaesha forand kforand @ wellandtribune.ca wainfleet - despite a plea from quad niagara atv president gerry stull and a 130-signature petition, township council will continue to forge ahead with the sale of an abandoned rail line. during a march 10 council meeting, there was discussion of setting aside the abandoned rail line for an atv trail instead of selling it to abutting land owners. council voted 3-2 in favour of the latter. after hearing of that discussion, stull and members of the atv group went door to door and collected 130 signatures hoping to encourage council to rescind its decision and to have a public meeting about the rail line. \"i am still a believer...that town councils are supposed to work for its people and what they want as a whole .\" he said the old east-west rail line that runs north of forkes rd. starting just east of deek's rd. and ending close to the dunnville town line would encourage atvers to ride legally on a trail, instead of riding on private property. \"these lands are a corridor that can link several of our local communities together via a multiuse trail which would run though virtually the heart of our community,\" stull said. longtime club member dennis zierle said he was saddened to hear of council's decision to sell the land without holding a public meeting. ald. evan main said he remembered stull's first presentation to council to create a policed trail system where people could pay to ride. fees would be applied to providing abutting land owners with $5 million in insurance coverage. however, main noted more than 10 months ago council began the process to dispose of the land through sale to abutting land owners, a process he said would be unfair to overturn. \"i do have a problem with going back on my word,\" main said. \"somehow it doesn't seem fair to me to change policies on a whim .\" operations director greg wuisman said the township has three applications to purchase portions of the land where residents have paid a $1,000 application fee. another two applications are in the works and he's received numerous other inquiries. continued after advertisement below ald. rudy warkentin has taken time to speak to farmers and home owners whose property abuts the line. he said many would be opposed to the trail. although he was elected to represent wainfleet as a whole, his concern is for people who would be directly affected. \"it's almost impossible to police this 24/7,\" he said. \"liability still leaves me with unanswered questions .\" mayor barb henderson said although councillors are elected to make decisions, \"people don't always like them .\" she said councillors have been accused of not listening to taxpayers when making decisions, but in this case they are listening to people who would be most affected by change. \"i for one will not change my mind with a public meeting,\" she said. group a week 27 march 23, 2009 away team score home team score club lasalle 22 st. joseph's bakery
