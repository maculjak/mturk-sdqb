(ap) - a pep rally skit by three white high school students who wore blackface and parodied <mark>chris brown</mark>'s arrest for assaulting rihanna has officials in a largely white new york district vowing to set clearer expectations for school events. the skit was one of several pop culture parodies performed friday at waverly high school as part of an annual \"mr. waverly\" competition, superintendent joseph yelich said. the one in question had a male student portraying <mark>brown</mark> standing over another cowering actor playing rihanna; a third male student played an arresting officer. a picture from the skit posted to social media and other sites including facebook, tumblr and cnn ireport drew thousands of views and dozens of comments, many calling the skit blatantly racist and blasting the idea of drawing laughs from domestic violence. <mark>brown</mark> was sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to felony assault for the attack on rihanna in 2009. both singers are black. yelich said he has not kept track of the number of complaints to the small district in southern new york's tioga county but said the \"mr. waverly\" tradition is being re-examined. other skits featured tarzan chasing a gorilla, hockey players brawling, and spider-man. \"i mean, this is a pep rally; we're supposed to be cheering on our team,\" said yelich, who has been on the job a little over a year. \"the fact that skits are involved and parodies...it strayed from that and it got into a different kind of competition .\" a waverly high alumnus who posted comments on cnn said that while he doesn't believe the students meant to offend, he was surprised administrators didn't intervene. \"there were adults who should have stood up and said,\" hey, guys, this is not ok. blackface is not ok. is it illegal? no. but you should really not do that,' \"matthew dishler, 24, told the associated press in a telephone interview. rose garrity, executive director of a new hope center, an agency in nearby oswego county that assists victims of domestic and sexual abuse and other crimes, also put responsibility on the adults .\" they were trying to make something funny that is far from funny, and they were being incredibly racist while they were doing it, \"garrity said .\" i doubt any of those children had any idea about the history of racism and minstrels or anything like that. \"garrity said her agency has been working with waverly and other districts on anti-violence and anti-bullying programs and would continue its outreach .\" domestic violence isn't funny, \"garrity said .\" three women every day are killed in this country by the man they're partnered with. it's anything but funny. \"lynx star speaks out against mn marriage amendment lynx star

out their loyal disciples and make believers of the rest: creed. on nov. 11, 2012 at smart araneta coliseum, lead vocalist scott stapp, bassist <mark>brian marshall</mark>, drummer <mark>scott phillips</mark> and guitarist/vocalist mark tremonti collectively known as creed will perform live their well-loved songs that have endeared them to fans regardless of shifting trends in the worldwide music industry. some of the most anticipated hits they racked up in their more than a decade of dominance are \"with arms wide open,\" \"my sacrifice,\" \"higher,\" \"what if,\" \"what's this life for,\" and \"are you ready .\" note that creed has its own greatest hits compilation album-one of the few from among their contemporaries. of their hits, \"wide arms wide open\" has proved to be their biggest so far with the song eventually ending up as best rock song in the 2011 grammy awards. the song about fatherhood that many believe has spiritual undertones, pushed the album to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide. it was also nominated in the grammys under the best rock performance by a duo or group with vocal. the voice of stapp is considered by many as one of the most compelling ones in the genre. in a review of one of their earliest performances, stapp's gravely but powerful voice was said to have the ability to energize a room as soon he steps up to the mic and it can fill up every available space! and though creed has been involved in several controversies through the years-including going into hiatus only to return stronger than before - they have remarkably weathered all these through the sheer force of their musical artistry. by the time 2011 had come, the quartet has been hailed by billboard magazine as the 18 th best artist of the last decade. one of their albums that moved 40 million units worldwide also ended up as the ninth best-selling artist of the 2000s. but it's not all nostalgia going for the concert in manila. it is said that the band has started recording new material for their fifth album so it won't be unlikely if they decide to sample some of these during the show, perhaps, even exclusively for their filipino fans. here's interesting trivia about creed: though regarded by many as a christian rock band due to some of their best songs focusing on themes such as eternity and faith, the band has never claimed to be one and, in fact, was never signed to a contemporary christian music label. it's just that unlike many other rock bands, creed chooses to deal with such topics as sexual abuse, hostility and lucid dreaming \"in a substantial, mature manner,\" said a reviewer. in an interview, stapp pointed out the difference between spiritual and religious lyrics: \"religion was about\" what not to do .' spirituality opens you up, sets you free. \"tickets to the creed live in manila are available in ticketnet outlets with the following ticket prices: * patron a standing 5,850 * patron b standing 4,500
