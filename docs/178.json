Content Continues Below The Minnesota senator dropped out of the 2020 race on the eve of Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Fellow former candidates Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Mike Bloomberg soon followed. Klobuchar will visit with union members in Detroit on Friday before hosting a Women for Biden event in Southfield, Michigan. On Saturday, Klobuchar will speak at a get-out-the-vote event in Grand Rapids. Biden won 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday, including delegate-rich Texas. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders captured four states, including the biggest prize of all, California. ___ 12:50 p.m. Elizabeth Warren says she will not be running for president in 2020 but guarantees that she will stay in the fight. Speaking to reporters Thursday outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Warren said she'd likely endorse one of the two major candidates left in the race, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, but \"not today.\" \"I need some space and I need a little time right now,\" she said, standing next to her husband, <mark>Bruce Mann</mark>, and golden retriever, Bailey. Warren's voice cracked when she talked about meeting so many little girls while campaigning around the country for the past year and knowing they \"are going to have to wait four more years,\" at least, to see a woman in the White House. The Massachusetts senator was the Democratic presidential primary's last top female candidate. She suspended her campaign Thursday, two days after a disappointing Super Tuesday that included a third-place finish in her home state. Warren added: \"I have no regrets at all. This has been the honor of a lifetime.\" ___ 10:50 a.m. Elizabeth Warren has ended her Democratic presidential bid after a disappointing finish in Super Tuesday states. That's according to a person familiar with her plans who wasn't authorized to speak about Warren's intentions and talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity. The Massachusetts senator's campaign had the markers of success: robust poll numbers, impressive fundraising, a national organization. But she was squeezed out by Bernie Sanders, who had an immovable base of voters she needed to advance. In the end, she didn't even win her home state--she finished third behind Joe Biden, who won it, and Sanders. Her exit from the race on Thursday came days after Amy Klobuchar dropped out.

They've already put their snowmobiles away for the season,\" said <mark>Jeff Anderson</mark>, owner of Sportland Yamaha in Cle Elum, which sells and repairs snowmobiles and off-road vehicles. \"It's not generating a lot of business.\" It's been a slow winter for everyone whose sales are tied to snowfall, which is only about a third of normal across the south-central Cascades, and has been limited to high elevations. While some business owners are holding out hope for late-season snowstorms, others are already switching to spring inventory. At Mountain High Sports in Ellensburg, owner Tami Walton said sales of winter clothing and gear were fine in December and January but slowed in February as the snow melted. She said some winter gear is now headed to the sale racks to make room for the spring sporting goods customers already are seeking. \"This year, it seems to be a different season every day, so we have about a 50-50 mix on the floor right now,\" Walton said. \"We did, however, leave the flip-flops in the boxes, but they are tagged and ready to go in case it is 80 degrees tomorrow.\" In Yakima, Sporthaus owner Sig Fossum said he's not planning to discount ski and snowboard gear yet, but he jokes that he does have snow on order. Dedicated skiers are making the best of the springlike conditions on the slopes while rooting for more snow, Fossum said. While the base of White Pass Ski Area looks grim from U.S. Highway 12, skiers report that the less-visible upper slopes have good snow and offer plenty of opportunities. Fossum said he's gotten in some good skiing at White Pass, but the warm weather in the Valley is pushing some of his customers to other sports. \"Business is slow, and we're having more interest in tennis a little bit earlier than usual,\" he said. \"It's quieter this year than last year because our weather down here is even nicer.\" Like other passionate skiers, Fossum is optimistic about the forecast of snow showers in the Cascades over the next few days, as temperatures are expected to range from the high - to low-30s, according to the National Weather Service. In Yakima, highs near 50 and lows in the 30s are expected, with chances of rain Thursday and Friday. Sunshine is expected to return Saturday. For the nonsnow sports enthusiasts, the warmer-than-usual weather has been good news. \"Our spring rush is about a month to six weeks early with this great weather,\" said <mark>Jeff Clark</mark>, co-owner of Revolution Cycles in Yakima. \"What I'm hearing is that people are tired of waiting for snow, so they are getting their bikes out. It's great for us.\" And the recent sunshine has inspired some gardeners to get an early start, said Lisa Lacour at Ace Hardware in Yakima. But she's been reminding people it's still February, too soon to plant much beyond the most cold-tolerant species. The springlike weather also allowed <mark>Anderson</mark>, the Cle Elum store owner, to sell a couple off-road vehicles last weekend, which he called highly unusual for February. But the sales this season didn't balance out the lack of interest in snowmobile gear and repairs caused by so few people riding. \"It's not what I like, but we're on to another season here pretty soon,\" <mark>Anderson</mark> said. His business has endured ups and downs with the weather before, he added. The lack of snow to entice snowmobilers also is affecting the bottom line at Whistlin' Jack Lodge, a popular home base for people who enjoy winter weekends in the Chinook Pass area, according to employee <mark>Scott Carlson</mark>. \"It's definitely hurting business,\" <mark>Carlson</mark> said. \"We are getting more hikers already, and people are already coming over and asking about fishing. But it's definitely not making up the difference.\" <mark>Carlson</mark> said that beyond the lost winter tourism, as a volunteer firefighter, he's also worried about the increased risk of wildfires this spring. \"We're already getting stuff prepared for the fire season,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bad fire season after having no snow like this.\" The long-term forecast calls for warm and dry conditions to continue for the next few months. Although, there's still a chance for a few more snowstorms, too. If serious snow arrives, local businesses will be ready to outfit customers."}, {"articleID": "2009022500_00010027_W", "names": {"Michael W.

people and killers. just then, the batmobile crashes down behind him, and batman steps out. right at the moment when hope is lost, when theres nowhere left to turn, the one with power to defeat the darkness and rescue him from a hopeless situation. the other scene is a couple minues later. rachel, who is the other person innoculated, has found a kid of maybe 8 or 9, who doesnt seem to be hallucinating too badly, and shes trying to protect him. then a band of escaped inmates comes out of the smoke, brandishing weapons, and slowly advances on her. she picks up a cops gun, and starts to back against a wall, holding the child close. rachel:\" oh, god...* pulls hammer of gun back * dont peek. \"kid:\" dont worry; batman will save us. he \"ll come.\" she gets ready to pull the trigger, as the inmates get closer, and just as she prepares to fire her first shot, who appears out of the smoke? right. batman flies in, beats the crud out of all 12 or 13 of them, and then flies off to find

car crash it's likely that royal bank of scotland will this week become the third bank to pay a substantial fine to settle charges that its traders tried to manipulate libor interest rates. more will follow. the problem for the banks and for their investors is that dealing with the regulators is only the start of it. libor is used to price all sorts of financial contracts, from interest rate swaps to some mortgages. anyone with a libor-related contract, or one linked to one or more of its sisters, could have grounds to seek compensation if they can prove they were disadvantaged by the traders' shenanigans. those people range from small borrowers, fighting on a no-win no-fee basis, to big hedge funds able to afford skilled and very expensive legal help. it's a potential car crash, and has even been described as the banks' \"tobacco moment\" . that's a reference to the string of lawsuits tobacco companies fought successfully, until the dam burst. what should investors do? i talked to all four banks, as well as analysts, and lawyers. let's start with the banks. none has yet made any provisions against the potential cost of libor-related lawsuits. this is the response i got from lloyds: \"we have not taken any provision as it's just not possible at the moment to predict the scope and outcome of the various regulatory investigations or private lawsuits that are out there. that's both in terms of timing or scale.\" rbs, barclays, and hsbc are taking a broadly similar stance. lloyds and hsbc may not be in it quite as deeply as rbs and barclays. how about the legal angle? rich eldridge, a finance partner at manches, was kind enough to help. here's what he had to say: \"to be successful borrowers will have to show the basis on which they were led to believe libor would be calculated was false and this was material. no one knows how likely the claims are to succeed, but judges will know successful claims could potentially bankrupt state-owned banks and hit pension funds.\" so when it comes to provisions: \"i doubt anyone knows the cost to the banks if the courts decide to award compensation for libor fixing. firstly, banks will need to repay customers who were overcharged. secondly, judges may cancel interest rate swap contracts based on libor and banks may be forced to compensate hedge funds who bought a bank's side of swap transactions. investors in bank shares will no doubt be wary with no published figure of the potential exposure. a concern for a lot of people is bank shares can form a sizeable proportion of investments by pension funds.\" in other words: this potential car crash could actually close off half the motorway. how does the market feel about this? <mark>ian gordon</mark> is one of the more independent minded and thoughtful analysts. he says almost no one has this issue \"front of mind\" . \"two reasons for that. one, the market has increasingly convinced itself that the burden of proof is very high. so other than the potential for a\" grand settlement \"the potential for an individual bank suffering a multi-billion hit feels much lower now than it did perhaps in early july.\" and, two, my guess is that any such settlement won't hit until 2016/17 which removes any spectre of an unmanageable hit to capital. just a potential hit to a (hopefully) more healthy income statement. \"so not the end of the world. who's likely to get hit? the received wisdom is barclays and rbs, as a result of the attempts at manipulation by their traders (worth pointing out that it's yet to be proved how successful they were). but mr <mark>gordon</mark> has an interesting theory:\" i can't help thinking that it was allegedly the [libor] submissions of lloyds [through hbos] and rbs which were persistently low-balled over an extended period and by a material amount. \"so his theory is the potential\" tail risks may be longest for lloyds and rbs? just a theory \". of course, the role of the bank of england in the\" low ball \"submissions of lloyds and rbs is somewhat murky. the central bank was desperately worried about the impact of a collapse in confidence in these two banks. but even if it was proved to have subtly endorsed the tactic you can't sue a central bank. if you want to grade the worries, rbs probably comes top followed by barclays and lloyds. hsbc shareholders may be able to breathe easier. its sins were largely committed elsewhere. as for valuations, they are still discounting difficulties for the banks. even though barclays shares have doubled since the summer it trades on only 0.6 times the book value of its businesses and a shade over 8.6 times earnings. as for lloyds, it is on 0.8 times book, 12.7 times earnings, while rbs is on a remarkably similar valuation (0.8 times, 13.3 times). hsbc, by contrast, sits on 1.3 times book, and 11.5 times this year's earnings. bound, beaten and robbed: backpackers attacked by whip-brandishing peruvian villagers in\" savage' two day

Hungary has selected Academy Award winning director <mark>Laszlo Nemes</mark>' sophomore feature Sunset as its submission in the best foreign-language film for the Oscars. In 2016 <mark>Nemes</mark> won an Oscar for his feature debut, Son of Saul - a stunning portrayal of a Jewish man's desperate attempt to give a dead boy he believes is his son a proper burial in the midst of the brutality of Nazi concentration camp. His new film, which premiered in competition at the Venice film festival last week, is set some 30 years before Son of Saul at another major historical juncture in the lives of Hungarians: the eve of the First World War.\" Sunset is about a civilisation at its crossroads, \"<mark>Nemes</mark> said in a statement issued Tuesday by the Hungarian National Film Fund.\" In the heart of Europe at the height of progress and technology, without being written in history, the personal story of a young woman becomes the reflection of the birth of the 20th century. \"Starring Juli Jakab as Irisz, a young woman who comes to live and work in Budapest in 1913 on a mission to find a brother she had never known of, the film dives into a world of violence and intrigue. With visual references to Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1957 anti-war film Paths of Glory and a nod to the masked sex party scene from his 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut, the film runs to nearly two and half hours in length. The Hollywood Reporter critic Deborah noted:\" The [film's] heavy symbolism and penchant for creating unresolved mysteries drives it far from the poignancy of Son of Saul. \"Produced by Laokoon Filmgroup, (Hungary) and Playtime (France) with the support of the Hungarian National Film Fund, Sunset was made on a budget of $10.4 million. Sony Pictures Classics has picked up the film for North America and Australia. World sales are being handled by Playtime. Hungary has a long history of submitting films to the Oscars, starting in 1965 with Zoltan Fabri's Twenty Hours. Nominated ten times (including last year for Ildiko Enyedi's On Body and Soul), it has won the coveted golden statuette twice - in 1981 for <mark>Istvan Szabo</mark>'s Mephist o and in 2016 for Son of Saul.

Bell Media's RDS cable sports channel has renewed a regional TV rights deal for Montreal Canadiens games for another 12 years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. But the agreement is key for Bell Media as it has French language subscribers still viewing Canadiens games going forward after the broadcaster was recently outbid by rival Rogers Communications for the national NHL TV rights as part of a US $4.9 billion, 12-year deal. The latest RDS-Canadiens deal includes continuing naming rights to Montreal's Bell Center for Bell Canada, and covers broadcast rights for 60 regular season games, and additional pre-season games each season. Bell Media and Rogers are also bidding for separate regional TV rights to Ottawa Senators games as broadcasters look to airing live NHL games to discourage cable and satellite TV subscribers from cutting or shaving the cord in the digital age. Rogers' Sportsnet cable channel currently has the regional TV rights to Senators games, and so is expected to pay dearly to retain the games in the face of competition from a hockey-hungry Bell Media. \"Duck Dynasty': Petition to Reinstate Star Passes 100,000 Signatures The latest installment in <mark>Peter Jackson</mark>'s trilogy focuses on the dwarves of Erebor's attempt to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.
