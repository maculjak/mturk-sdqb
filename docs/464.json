The Rabbitohs are flying high at the top of the NRL ladder after notching up nine straight victories. With the likes of Damien Cook and <mark>Robert Jennings</mark> enjoying breakout seasons, George and <mark>Tom Burgess</mark> running over the top of rival forward packs and veteran <mark>John Sutton</mark> discovering career-best form, the Bunnies have been installed as premiership favourites. Before a ball had been kicked in anger this year they were considered title outsiders, however expectations are now soaring in Redfern. Parallels are being drawn between this year's side under rookie coach Anthony Seibold and the one that broke a 43-year premiership brought in 2014. While clubs usually shy away from such comparisons, Rabbitohs talisman <mark>Burgess</mark> is happy to declare the side is playing better football this year compared with four years ago. However he points out that the rest of the competition has gone forward alongside them. \"We're playing better football than in 2014, certainly,\" <mark>Burgess</mark> said. \"Some of the shape that we're throwing and the combinations we've got going at the moment are probably better than what we had in 2014 .\" But that's probably a reflection of the competition as well. Everyone improves year-in and year-out and adapts with the times. \"Whether that means we're going to do the same thing as 2014, that's a different story. The competition is completely different. We understand that .\" Their convincing 24-6 win over Canterbury on Saturday got Souths to nine wins on the trot, the first time in 29 years they've achieved the feat. But <mark>Burgess</mark> said it would count for little if they didn't go on with the job. When the Rabbitohs last went nine in a row in 1989, they fell one game short of the grand final and <mark>Burgess</mark> said they were out to avoid the same fate. \"It really doesn't count, the amount of games you win in a row,\" <mark>Burgess</mark> said. \"You've got to be consistent, we understand that. But also you've got to get it right when the time's right and we all know when that is .\" When finals come around, there's no point winning nine in a row and resting on that because people don't care about it. \"* All Offers and Promotions posted in this article excludes NSW residents.", "articleID": "2018071607_00222622_W", "names": {"Tom Burgess": ["Q3530669", "Q7815127", "Q7815128", "Q7815129"]}}, {"date": "2018-07-16", "url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2018/7/16/372950/Khyree-Thompson-Denied-New-Trial-For.aspx", "content": "Khyree Thompson Denied New Trial For 2015 Motel Murder Monday, July 16, 2018 Khyree Thompson Khyree Thompson, 23, appeared in Judge Don Poole's courtroom Monday with a motion for a new trial.

Sprinting great Usain Bolt appears close to securing a trial stint with the Central Coast Mariners. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola takes time to meet Melbourne City players and fans in Australia. Sydney FC won't rush into signing replacements for Bobo and Adrian Mierzejewski, with chief executive Danny Townsend aiming to reel in a big fish as European transfer actions heats up. The Sky Blues are searching far and wide as they attempt to cover the loss of Bobo, who earlier this year broke the record for most goals in an A-League season, and Mierzejewski, who claimed the Johnny Warren medal in his only season with the club. They unsuccessfully courted Spanish striker <mark>Fernando Torres</mark>, while Japanese star Keisuke Honda has been strongly linked with Melbourne Victory. Townsend still has high hopes of attracting a high-profile player with the help of the Football Federation Australia's marquee fund. \"<mark>Torres</mark> was obviously one to be allocated some of those funds. If we come up with another one that has that level of marketing attraction then we'd put it to the FFA,\" he told AAP. \"We're doing that every day. Every day another player comes up, we ask the question .\" They run it through their models and tell us if it's viable. \"The important thing is we don't need to rush. We've got the core nucleus of the team in place and we'll look to add some quality, most probably in the front three .\" The A-League season starts in October while European transfer windows close in August. \"If you look back over the years, our foreign players have come in reasonably late,\" Townsend said. \"We're not panicking, we've got plenty of time .\" We want to make the right decision both from a performance and marketing perspective. \"There's plenty of fish in the sea...every day throws up a different name .\" There's so many different players, particularly as the window in Europe opens and gets going post World Cup; there'll be more and more opportunities. \"Bobo and Mierzejewski scored a combined 40 goals in the 2017-18 season, underling the immense void the Sky Blues are attempting to fill. Captain Alex Brosque--who has scored more goals and made more appearance for Sydney FC than any other player--insists the duo's departure won't change the way his side plays .\" Our style, defensively how aggressive we are...that won't change, \"Brosque said .\" The boys that come in will have to adapt to that and learn that quickly. \"Adrian and Bobo leave a very big hole, when you consider what they did last season, but it's the way football is .\" They'll leave and new players will replace them and do just as good a job. \"Comments Use a Facebook account to add a comment, subject to Facebook's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

(Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times) Share Tweet Share Email LINKEDIN PINTEREST REDDIT TUMBLR STUMBLEUPON President Donald Trump has declined Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to interrogate the 12 Russian intelligence officers indicted on charges linked to attempted interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. At the July 16 summit in Helsinki, Putin offered to submit a request for Russian law enforcement to interrogate the 12 officers, who were charged days before the meeting. The Russian leader further offered to allow members of special counsel Robert Mueller's team travel to Russia and observe the interrogation, under the condition that the United States reciprocate the concession. \"It is a proposal that was made in sincerity by President Putin, but President Trump disagrees with it,\" White House press secretary <mark>Sarah Sanders</mark> said in a statement on July 19. \"Hopefully, President Putin will have the 12 identified Russians come to the United States to prove their innocence or guilt .\" Mueller filed the indictment against the Russian officers on July 13 at the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia. The indictment charges that the Russians hacked into Democratic computer systems, stole emails and files, and disseminated the loot with the intention of interfering in the 2016 election. The United States does not have a standing extradition treaty with Russia. Complicating matters further, since 2014, members of Russia's active military, intelligence, and law enforcement are prohibited by an internal directorate from traveling outside Russia, except to a few countries including China and Vietnam. All 12 of the Russian nationals named in the indictment are members of the Russian military intelligence agency formerly known as the GRU. In addition, the Russian constitution shields its citizens from extradition and deportation. As a result, extradition of nationals from Russia is extremely difficult and rare. The United States has succeeded in extraditing several Russian nationals for computer crimes in recent years, but in all cases, they were not in Russia at the time of the extradition. During the summit, Putin referenced a treaty between the United States and Russia that allows for cooperation between the two nations on criminal investigations. Signed in 1999 by President Bill Clinton and approved by the Senate in 2001, the treaty establishes a process for law enforcement agencies to carry out criminal investigations at the request of their counterparts. Trump's rejection of the offer comes after a nearly four-day media onslaught following the summit. Major news outlets with a track record of anti-Trump coverage seized on his remarks at the summit to paint a picture of American surrender. Despite measured statements by both leaders and signals of a warming relationship, commentators compared the summit to Pearl Harbor and 9/11. \"The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media,\" Trump wrote on Twitter on July 19. The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media.

Standing alongside Putin, Trump told reporters that he has confidence in American intelligence agencies and that Putin offered him a \"powerful\" denial when they met in private. After the summit, and with the media in overdrive about his comments, Trump corrected a single word from his statement in Helsinki and again affirmed his support of the U.S. intelligence agencies. \"It should have been obvious. I thought it would be obvious, but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn't. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word\" would' instead of \"wouldn't,'\" Trump said on July 18. \"The sentence should have been,\" I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia .' \"Trump's request for the Russian officers to stand trial mimics Putin's own take on how the meddling allegations can be resolved. When discussing the allegations at the summit, Putin told a reporter that only a court of law could have the final say on the issue .\" Do you believe the United States is a democracy? \"Putin said .\" And if so, if it is a democratic state, then the final conclusion in this kind of dispute can only be delivered by a trial by the court, not by the executive--by the law enforcement. \"In announcing the charges against the Russian officers, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that the indictment contains no allegation of a crime by an American citizen. Rosenstein noted that Trump was briefed on the charges ahead of the announcement.

The jury deliberated most of Friday afternoon before announcing its verdict in the 8-day trial. HENNEPIN--A 68-year-old Standard man is guilty of bludgeoning his 62-year-old sister-in-law to death and burying her in a yard near his home, a Putnam County jury ruled late this afternoon. Clifford A. Andersen Jr., who bashed in 62-year-old Deborah Dewey's head, will be sentenced Aug. 23--the 2-year anniversary of her disappearance--for first-degree murder and concealment of her homicide. He faces a minimum of 20 years and up to life in prison with no possibility of parole. The Ladd woman was reported missing on Aug. 23, 2016; her body was found that Sept. 12 buried in the yard of a vacant home blocks from Andersen's, which he cared for. His DNA was mixed with hers in blood that was found inside the home. \"Justice for Debbie has been a long time coming,\" Dewey's niece, Sue Marshall, said this afternoon. The 2-week trial, presided over by Judge Stephen A. Kouri, featured 55 witnesses and more than 600 exhibits. Andersen, who gambled and had taken out numerous high-interest payday loans, was getting money from Dewey, who finally decided to cut him off.

The other victim who died, identified by police as a 10-year old Toronto-area girl, has not been publicly named. It is not known where Fallon was along the strip of Danforth Avenue, where a gunman shot 15 people, prompting mass casualty responses at Toronto hospitals. But the 15 victims were found on the street, in a restaurant, an ice cream parlour, a coffee shop, and other places in Toronto's Greektown. Video shot from an apartment above a store shows a man dressed in black firing at least three times into an ice cream parlour from the sidewalk. Police were urging witnesses to immediately contact police to report what they may have seen or heard. Given the time, around 10 p.m. on a warm summer night, the Danforth would have been busy with hundreds of people.

They want to share his story in hopes that it may save lives. <mark>Baker</mark> Jr. found out about his allergy only two years ago, and experts say that can often be the case. \"If they have any kind of reaction distant from the sting site, such has hives or the same kind of symptoms previously described--tightness, problems breathing, those kinds of symptoms--they should see an allergist and have testing done,\" said Dr. Marie-Helen Sajous of Dartmouth Medical Center. <mark>Baker</mark> Jr. was an organ donor, and his family said it brings them some peace knowing his death may change someone's life for the better.
