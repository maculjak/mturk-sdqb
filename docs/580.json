It would depend what the players were feeling and saying. \"But I would be absolutely, 100 per cent behind them if (they wanted to walk off), and I'm sure it would be a group decision. But we're not there yet, so it's hypothetical to a degree .\" All I know is that Toni Rudiger said he heard some racist chanting or comments, and I haven't had chance for an individual conversation with Toni.

Wherever this happens it needs to be dealt with. \"If it happened and it's fact, then punishment is needed and it needs to be strong .\" Willian's brace handed Chelsea a stunning 2-0 win at Spurs, who had Son Heung-min sent off for kicking out at Rudiger. Defender Rudiger complained of alleged racist abuse in the second half in north London, leaving Tottenham pledging to complete a full investigation. \"We are now conducting a thorough investigation which will include liaising with Chelsea and their players for their observations,\" read a Tottenham statement. \"Any form of racism is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our stadium. We take any such allegations extremely seriously and shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to be behaving in such a way, including stadium bans .\" Tottenham boss Mourinho--who sarcastically said he hoped Rudiger \"recovers quick from the broken ribs\" after Son's glancing blow--backed referee <mark>Taylor</mark>'s stance in halting the match. <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> applauds his Chelsea players at Tottenham (REUTERS) \"I've not much to say apart from it's something that saddens me,\" said Mourinho. \"I hate racism in society, I hate racism in football, I'm disappointed that things like that can still happen .\" But the referee stopped the game, spoke with the players, spoke with the coaches, spoke with the captains. \"As soon as I knew the reasons why the game was stopped I obviously understood and accepted it .\" Rudiger tweeted after the game and included the hashtags \u00a3 NoToRacism and \u00a3 PleaseGetSomeBasicEducation, and Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham hailed his team-mate's response. \"He is a strong character and it showed because he is a fantastic player and overcame it,\" he said. \"Everyone is doing as much as they can to make a stop for it. But there are going to be one or two people who will always remain the same .\" More about <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> | Antonio Rudiger | chelsea fc | Premier League | Show {{#moreThan 3_total}} {{value_total}} {{/ moreThan3_total}} comments Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) | Photo: AP Updated: December 24, 2019 08:01 AM Created: December 24, 2019 07:53 AM New York (AP) - Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will resign from the board next week, effectively severing ties with the ride-hailing company he co-founded a decade ago. Uber turbocharged the gig economy and since 2010 has logged 15 billion trips. Kalanick was ousted as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in numerous lawsuits. Advertisement The departure did not come as a surprise. Kalanick recently sold more than $2.5 billion worth of shares in the company, more than 90% of his holdings. \"Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,\" Kalanick said in a prepared statement Tuesday. \"I'm proud of all that Uber has achieved, and I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines .\" Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, the company ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be reeling out of control. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick calls Fowler's accusations \"abhorrent\" and hires former U.S. Attorney General <mark>Eric Holder</mark> to investigate. Days later, Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that Anthony Levandowski - a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project - stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division. Then, The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's use of the Greyball software.

She would then return to the family's Byron Bay home only to start cooking healthy, homemade meals for him and his sister, and it taught him one crucial, lifelong lesson - something he dubs the \"single mum work ethic\". It had a \"profound impact\" , and as soon as he could, Mr Suby began taking on after-school jobs to help out, including his first role grinding peanut butter at a health food store for just $2.50 an hour. \"I also started busking at markets with my harmonica on the weekends trying to earn $80 to $100 to help with electricity bills or groceries - I gave all my money to my mum,\" he told news.com. au. Sabri Suby worked multiple jobs as a teen to help his single mum but now runs a $30 million company. \"Watching her work so hard had a profound effect on me and it has served me in life .\" You might have more connections or have grown up in a better area or with two parents, but one thing you can't take away from me is my work ethic. \"Mr Suby got an after-school sales job at 16 and discovered a natural knack for it. After finishing high school, he made a conscious decision not to go straight to uni, so he packed his bags and moved to London for two years, working in sales\" door to door, face-to-face and over the phone \". Again, it was an industry he thrived in, and he decided to move back to Australia and study business marketing at RMIT. He worked full time for a company selling Google AdWords and specialising in online marketing and search engine optimisation to support himself as he studied, making a near-minimum wage base salary and earning sales commissions on top. However, he was\" not living a lavish lifestyle by any means \"and the wage was\" just enough to survive \"- so at 21, he started his own business after realising he could do things better. It made more than a million dollars in revenue, and Mr Suby went on to launch a string of other businesses. <mark>King Kong</mark> now employs 34 people in its Melbourne office .\" Some failed, some did OK and some I sold, \"he explained. Then, five years ago, he launched digital marketing company <mark>King Kong</mark>. At the time he had just a\" couple of hundred dollars in the bank \"after experiencing years of business ups and downs and having just gotten married .\" I was at ground zero but I had made a commitment to this girl, so it was time to pony up and forge a real business career, \"he said .\" It was the moment I drew a line in the sand - I was literally wondering how I was going to pay rent, so I decided to go back to my roots, making 150 cold calls a day. \"I had no rich uncle, no venture capital or loans or savings, so I had to go out there and make it myself .\" In the beginning, Mr Suby was working 18-hour days doing everything himself from running errands to cleaning the office and bookkeeping. But then he stumbled upon a simple rule that changed everything. It was the \"80-20 rule\" - also known as the Pareto principle. The 34-year-old is now a married father of one. \"The principle is that 20 per cent of the input of anything will give you 80 per cent of the output - so 20 per cent of customers will give 80 per cent of profits, or 20 per cent of the roads in a city will carry 80 per cent of the traffic,\" he said. \"It wasn't until I sat down and had a real audit of my time that I realised what I was doing wasn't sustainable - so I asked myself,\" what are the things I'm doing that are actually moving the money needle and driving the business forward or making more revenue?' So I started to automate or delegate and take the grunt work out of the business. \"That's when things truly\" exploded \".\" It was like a switch - once I made the conscious decision to spend all my time selling, within a couple of days, instead of getting one or two clients a week we were getting four to five. It doubled sales almost overnight, \"he said. Today <mark>King Kong</mark> is valued at $30 million with a three-year growth rate of 314 per cent, has 65 staff members in its shiny new Melbourne office and attracts thousands of new clients each month. Mr Suby, now a 34-year-old father of one, said it was a\" humbling experience \"to have gone from such a modest upbringing to become a multimillion-dollar success story. Sabri Suby says the key to success is to work hard--and work smart .\" The opportunities we have in Australia are incredible - you can come from an unfortunate upbringing with just one parent working three jobs with no money, no private school and no cheque written for uni...and turn yourself into a multimillion-dollar success, \"he said .\" You can go out there with no resources from an unfortunate situation...but when people roll up their sleeves and get the job done it doesn't matter the colour of your skin, where you come from or who your parents are, it evens the playing field. \"Don't wait for somebody to tell you you're worthy of success, just get out there .\" Mr Suby, whose first book, Sell Like Crazy, became a bestseller this year, said the secret to success came down to \"working tirelessly\" - but also working smart. \"Isolate the things you have to do to drive the business forward, and work like a dog on those things. Find the small hinges that swing the big doors,\" he said. Mr Suby's book was released earlier this year. \"One thing that is constant is that the hardest worker in the room will be a success, and my advice is you want to exercise your work ethic like a muscle - you won't make money without hard work .\" More Stories From $7 Pizza Hut wage to $250m empire premium_icon Burger chain's rapid expansion to 50 outlets More Stories From $7 Pizza Hut wage to $250m empire premium_icon Burger chain's rapid expansion to 50 outlets Show More 0 80-20 rule Read More Login to follow australian entrepreneur Read More Login to follow editorship Read More Login to follow entrepreneur Read More Login to follow millionaire Read More Login to follow 80-20 rule australian entrepreneur editorship entrepreneur millionaire", "articleID": "2019122503_00028272_W", "names": {"King Kong": ["Q2171232", "Q22278621", "Q6411824"]}}, {"date": "2019-12-26", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/businessman-with-bullet-injury-found-dead-in-car/articleshow/72986788.cms", "content": "Delhi: Businessman with bullet injury found dead in car Top Searches: Delhi: Businessman with bullet injury found dead in car TNN | Updated: Dec 27, 2019, 5:35 IST Sachin Agarwal NEW DELHI: A 36-year-old businessman was found dead with a gunshot wound on his right temple in Vivek Vihar area in east Delhi on Thursday morning.
