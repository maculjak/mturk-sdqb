beatlemania is set to break out again this week when the beatles' digitally remastered albums and a new computer game are released as the world's most famous pop group finally embraces the digital age. the legendary british quartet's entire back catalogue has been remastered and cleaned up, while the fab four appear in the beatles: rock band, which is tipped to become one of the world's biggest selling games. the beatles' company apple corps has historically shunned releasing their music in digital formats due to piracy concerns. but rock band players will be able to download entire albums in the coming months as the 1960s icons catch up with 21st century technology. the beatles' back catalogue was first released on compact disc in 1987, though many fans felt the sound quality did not match the original vinyl, while technological advances since then have highlighted flaws and imperfections. the new versions, to be released on wednesday, include the group's 12 albums, plus the magical mystery tour soundtrack and the past masters releases covering non-album singles. some are tipping them to dominate the charts around the globe. two box sets are also being released: one in stereo and the other in mono. the albums are those released in britain, and retain the original artwork and track listings. it is the first time that the group's first four albums - please please me, with the beatles, a hard day's night and beatles for sale - have been released on compact disc entirely in stereo. the albums were digitally remastered over a four-year period at abbey road studios in london, where the beatles - lead guitarist <mark>george harrison</mark>, rhythm guitarist <mark>john lennon</mark>, bassist paul mccartney and drummer ringo starr - recorded most of their music. the remasters were done \"utilising state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings,\" apple corps and record label emi said. \"the result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the catalogue has seen since its original release .\" it was agreed that electrical clicks, microphone vocal pops, excessive sibilance and bad edits should be improved where possible, so long as it didn't impact on the original integrity of the songs, \"they said. de-noising technology was only used for less than five of the beatles' 525 minutes of music. to mark the revival, the bbc is running a beatles week, with programmes examining the band in the studio, their first visit to the united states, their impact in the former soviet union and the beatlemania phenomenon. the broadcasts feature previously unreleased out-takes and studio chat. meanwhile the fab four have been recreated in virtual forms in the beatles: rock band, a game that lets players join the band as they springboard from gigs in their native liverpool, northwest england, to global stardom. players strum away at plastic replicas of guitars played by <mark>lennon</mark>, harrison and mccartney, keep the beat on a version of starr's drum kit, or try out beatles harmonies. forty-five songs are included with the videogame, and more of the bands' tunes will be sold as digital downloads from the internet. the abbey road album will be released in october, followed by sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band in november and rubber soul in december. the videogame will be available for play on the three major consoles: microsoft's xbox 360, sony's playstation 3, and nintendo's wii. a 30-second clip has been produced to promote the game, using archive footage, actors and computer trickery to bring the famous\" abbey road \"cover to life .\" the project is a fun idea which broadens the appeal of the beatles and their music, \"mccartney said. the concept for the videogame was honed with input from mccartney and starr as well as from beatles widows <mark>yoko ono</mark> and olivia harrison .\" how wonderful that the beatles' legacy will find its natural progression into the 21st century through the computerised world we live in, \"starr said .\" the game is good, the graphics are very good - and we were great. \"- afp social bookmarking allows users to save and categorise a personal collection of bookmarks and share them with others. this is different to using your own browser bookmarks which are available using the menus within your web browser. use the links below to share this article on the social bookmarking site of your choice. free newsletter take a byte out of iol technology by technology -

with the fifth and reportedly final season of \"supernatural\" starting tonight, september 10th, 2009, on the cw, what better time to sing the praises of this often clever and always underrated show via a review of the recently released fourth season blu-ray and dvd editions? if you've never seen \"supernatural\" start at the beginning, but if you've seen the first three seasons, don't give up on number four. blu-ray rating: 4.0 / 5.0 by its fourth year, \"supernatural\" had settled into a confident, unpredictable groove, beautifully weaving individual urban legends in a mystery-of-the-week format while also telling an interesting overall story. of course, i don't expect to see \"supernatural\" on ten-best lists next to shows like \"lost\" or \"mad men,\" but there's something to be said for a show that's been consistently entertaining for four years and counting. \"supernatural\" has been incredibly entertaining. \"supernatural\" works for the same two reasons that most shows succeed - quality writing and an effective ensemble to deliver it. if the show has a weakness, it's that they've never quite developed the supporting ensemble effectively but the two leads - jared padalecki and, particularly, jensen ackles - have gotten better every year. supernatural: the complete fourth season was released on blu-ray and dvd on september 1st, 2009. photo credit: warner brothers home video padalecki and ackles play sam and dean winchester, respectively, a pair of supernatural investigators, men trying to come to terms with both the details of their own dark pasts and with the constant battle between heaven and hell. dean knows a thing or two about the latter as the third season ended with him literally being dragged to the fiery underneath. of course, there's no show without dean and the more rebellious of the winchester brothers finds himself back on solid ground at the beginning of the fourth season of \"supernatural,\" sometimes accompanied by an angel who reports that god himself needed dean back in the real world for an important battle to come. why? dean will play a role in the stopping of the ultimate villain in the history of the show, lucifer himself. so, sam and dean are back traveling the world and stopping the forces of the supernatural wherever they go with a group of writers who seem downright inspired by being able to weave issues of classical angels and demons into the overall fabric of the show. knowing that the overall arc of the season would be incredibly dark, the mysteries of the week in \"supernatural\" display a lighter tone in season four, including battles with a 7-foot teddy bear and an episode that opens with dean running in terrified fear from a tiny dog. what's great about \"supernatural\" is how quickly the show can turn on itself. take for example the great \"it's the great pumpkin, sam winchester,\" which opens by playing with the urban legend of razor blades in halloween candy, hinting at a lighter-toned episode, but becomes both honestly scary and one of the more important episodes in the character arcs of the entire season. watching the fourth season of \"supernatural,\" i was struck by two thoughts - one, that the show has arguably never been more consistently entertaining (in part due to the switch in focus from sam to dean and the developed acting ability of ackles), and, two, that i'll be disappointed if the fifth season is truly the last. if one of your favorite shows is coming to blu-ray and dvd, you should hope that warner brothers is the studio releasing it. they do tv on blu-ray right. \"supernatural\" looks amazing in hd and even the dvd version is better than average technically for the format. blu-ray 1080p is absolutely the way to go - the video and audio are flawless - but if you haven't jumped to the next-gen format yet, the standard dvd looks much better than average. the special features on \"supernatural\" are the same on blu-ray and dvd and are presented in high definition on the former. special features include the 3-section featurette \"the mythologies of supernatural from heaven to hell,\" extended/unaired scenes, gag reel, and the following commentary tracks: episode 4.3 \"in the beginning\" - executive producer eric kripke and writer jeremy carver episode 4.21 \"when the levee breaks\" - writer sera gamble and director <mark>robert singer</mark> episode 4.22 \"lucifer rising\" - writer/director eric kripke \"supernatural: the complete fourth season' is released by warner brothers home video and stars jared padalecki and jensen ackles. it was created by eric kripke. the fourth season was released on september 1st, 2009. it is not rated and runs 924 minutes. by brian tallerico content director hollywoodchicago.com brian @ hollywoodchicago.com chicago -

halting the financial sector's death plunge is arguably the government's most measurable achievement this year. yet as president barack obama observes the one-year anniversary of lehman brothers' collapse, his administration's increasingly sunny assessment of wall street's rebound faces a hard sell. the rescue effort, initiated by his predecessor, was expensive, and it bailed out the very institutions that the public blames for the crisis. small banks are still failing, the institutions once considered too big to fail are putting on weight once again, and obama's main pledge - a more watchful eye on wall street - hasn't taken hold in congress. what's more, it's hard to cheer for wall street when unemployment is rising, foreclosures have not abated and bankers lobby for bigger paychecks. obama on monday plans a speech in new york assessing the condition of the financial markets. his treasury secretary, timothy geithner, previewed the administration's upbeat line this past week. \"the emerging confidence and stability of september 2009 is a far cry from the crippling fear and panic of september 2008,\" geithner told a congressional watchdog panel thursday. <mark>robert shapiro</mark>, a former adviser to president bill clinton and now chairman of sonecon, an economic advisory firm, said the administration gets \"a very good grade for addressing the acute problem, but this is so far from over .\" economists and banking analysts largely agree that after the failure of lehman brothers a year ago, the financial system was on the edge of a precipice. among the steps generally credited for stabilizing the system are the federal reserve's slashed interest rates and trillions in increased bank liquidity; the $700 billion troubled asset relief program that president george w. bush initiated and obama pursued; and tests that obama's treasury administered to determine whether the biggest banks had enough access to money to withstand a further economic downturn. \"the consensus is that we're off the brink. we were certainly on it,\" said <mark>karen shaw</mark> petrou, managing partner of federal financial analytics in washington. while the financial sector is no longer in a panic and many signs point to a recession that is on the mend, the public remains doubtful about their own financial status. a pew research center poll last month found that slightly more than half of those surveyed said the condition of the economy was poor. nearly two out of five said the economy was \"only fair .\" people questioned in august were more pessimistic about their own financial situation than those surveyed in june. no wonder. despite some easing of credit, bank lending remains tight. the treasury department, citing analysts' projections, said more than 6 million families could face foreclosure over the next three years. so far this year, 89 banks have failed, crippled by increasing loan defaults. bigger banks that received billions of dollars from the recovery program are beginning to pay back the money. they are on more solid footing and want to get out from under government restrictions. but even they are relying on extraordinary measures by the fed and the federal deposit insurance corp. \"the fact that some of the biggest banks are not failing is a triumph of very low expectations,\" petrou said. while lawmakers and regulators warn about the hazards of having financial institutions that are too large and intertwined, some institutions have emerged from the financial crisis larger than before. aided and prodded by the government last year, jpmorgan chase & co.bought bear stearns, bank of america corp. was forced to buy merrill lynch & co., and wells fargo & co. acquired wachovia. as of june 30, those three banks held $2.3 trillion in domestic deposits, or $3 out of every $10 in deposit in the united states. three years ago those three institutions held about 20 percent of the industry total. the danger is that large institutions that engage in high-risk ventures could require extraordinary government help to keep them from toppling the entire financial system. that's what the government had to do with american international group inc., the giant insurance company that received nearly $70 billion in bailout money. to avoid that, obama has recommended a series of regulatory changes, including new oversight powers for the fed, increased capital requirements for institutions and other conditions designed to discourage companies from getting too big. but congress has yet to act and some of obama's proposals are meeting resistance within his own party. the public for now is far more focused on the debate over health care to pay attention to the need for restrictions on derivatives and other complex financial instruments. while high wall street salaries and bonuses have caused a sensation, a recent cbs poll shows the public split on whether the government should place restrictions on executive pay. for obama, the blend of success, lingering financial and economic troubles and mixed public sentiment presents a political conundrum. for now, he has time on his side - at least until next year's congressional election campaigns begin in earnest. \"ultimately the public judges presidents and congresses not on whether or not they like a particular policy, but on whether or not the policy has a result they like,\" <mark>shapiro</mark> said. \"if it succeeds, the public will be fine, he will be fine, the democrats will be fine. and if it doesn't, they're all in trouble .\" welcome to golo, where wral.com visitors can comment on stories and create profile pages, blogs and photo galleries. make this story a golo hot topic! this story is 2 votes short of making the electrician and wake technical community college instructor steve windham answers your questions about keeping your home's power running. 10 questions about n.c. wildlife n.c. wildlife commission chairman steve windham answers your questions about the future of hunting and the state's wilderness areas. photos: pops in the park the north carolina symphony's pops in the park concert. sept. 11 observances drawing on the spirit that spurred emergency responders to rush to the burning world trade center on sept. 11, 2001, americans looked for ways to...a year of n.c. drought maps view a time lapse animation of drought conditions during the last year. a yellow lunch box tours n.c. follow wral news photographer richard adkins and his yellow lunch box as they tour north carolina, seeking out the best places for lunch.", "articleID": "2009091311_00013127_W", "names": {"Karen Shaw": ["Q29643587", "Q50414262"]}}]
