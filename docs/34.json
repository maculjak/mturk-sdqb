chapter in the global epidemic. top flu and animal-health experts with the united nations in rome and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta were monitoring the situation, but said the infected turkeys have suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. chile's turkey meat remains safe to eat, the experts said, and so far there have been no signs of a deadly mutation. none of the birds have died from this flu, according to the farms' owner, sopraval sa. chile's health ministry said it ordered a quarantine friday for two turkey farms outside the port city of valparaiso after genetic tests confirmed sick birds were afflicted with the same virus that has caused a pandemic among humans. the infected birds are contained within closed buildings, preventing any spread to wild birds, the farms' owner said. so far, the virus - a mixture of human, pig and bird genes - has proved to be very contagious but no more deadly than common seasonal flu. however, virus experts fear a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if it combines again with avian flu, which is far more deadly but tougher to pass along. sopraval alerted the agriculture ministry after egg production dropped at the farms this month. after initial tests on four samples, further genetic testing confirmed a match with the subtype a/h1n1 2009, the agriculture and health ministries announced. \"what the turkeys have is the human virus - there is no mutation at all,\" deputy health minister jeannette vega told chile's radio cooperativa on friday. the health ministry said it ordered a complete quarantine friday and alerted the u.n.'s world health organization. the u.n.'s food and agriculture organization, meanwhile was working closely with chilean government scientists, said dr. juan lubroth, the head of infectious diseases for fao in rome. chile is sending some samples outside the country for more genetic sequencing to confirm that it matches the pandemic strain, lubroth said. \"as a scientist, i want to touch, smell, feel, taste it\" before agreeing that it's a match, he said. there are some encouraging signs that this particular outbreak remains mild. egg production and water consumption among the birds dropped - prompting the company to take action - but the birds aren't terribly sick, let alone dying in large numbers, lubroth said. \"my understanding is that with the ones that were sick, it was a very mild disease,\" lubroth said. \"it's significant in that we don't need to recommend any drastic measures, as far as culling the population of turkeys. let them go through their illness and recover - seven to 10 days - and if they are sound and healthy, they could enter the food chain .\" sopraval veterinarian andrea campos said that won't happen because the outbreak has been limited to birds raised to lay eggs, not those being fattened for meat. \"in all of the birds raised to be fattened to produce meat, we have not found any illness. this is an illness entirely limited within a reproductive group,\" campos said. lubroth praised the company and the chilean ministries for the actions they've taken. \"if it were highly virulent then we would recommend stronger measures,\" lubroth added. chile, meanwhile, is acting to contain the outbreak by limiting the turkeys' contact with people and wildlife, lubroth said. but given the mildness of this particular outbreak, he said, \"i don't see that there is going to be a large risk from what we know today of this type of transmission occurring .\" u.s. health officials said they remain wary of the possibility that swine flu will mutate by mixing with bird flu or other forms of influenza. but they haven't received any reports of a dangerous mutation yet, and the fact that the virus can spread to turkeys was not all that surprising, said dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, speaking at a friday news conference in atlanta. the chilean report \"did not raise any great concerns among us,\" fauci said. the u.s. department of agriculture has a longstanding avian influenza surveillance program that it says would detect any h1n1 virus outbreak in u.s. poultry. the usda recently infected ducks, chickens, turkeys and quail in lab experiments, and none became clinically ill. low levels of the virus infected the quail, but the disease did not spread, the agency said this week. in chile, the virus has infected at least 12,000 people and killed 128. throughout the americas, as of aug. 14, 105,882 confirmed cases were reported from all 35 countries, including 1,579 deaths in 22 countries. ___ associated press writers <mark>michael warren</mark> in

than 60 years, as many parts of queensland sizzle in the final days of winter. weather forecasters are predicting a maximum of 33 degrees in the sunshine state capital today - marginally topping the august 1946 record of 32.8 degrees. the steamy conditions will be accompanied by strong winds, prompting a complete 48-hour fire ban in the southern half of the state. \"we're going to see near-record or record temperatures,\" bureau of meteorology senior forecaster gavin holcombe said. \"the strong winds, dry conditions, high temperatures will all create probably extreme fire danger for the south-east coast .\" total fire ban the lighting of all fires, including permit fires, has been banned across most areas of the state south of mt isa until midnight tomorrow. queensland fire and rescue service commissioner <mark>lee johnson</mark> has encouraged residents to report small grass fires as quickly as possible. \"in these conditions, a small grass fire can turn into a large bushfire threat very quickly,\" mr <mark>johnson</mark> said. \"if you see a small fire near your property or even on a median strip, dial triple zero straight away .\" \"the qfrs is not taking any chances and we are well prepared for these conditions .\" last night qfrs crews battled grass fires at tallai in the gold coast hinterland, and on the outskirts of beaudesert to the city's south-west and esk to the north-west. rural fire service strike teams are on standby to provide a rapid response if necessary. \"the sooner we can start fighting the fire, the less chance we have of it getting out of control .\" mr <mark>johnson</mark> has also asked motorists not to flick cigarette butts from car windows. \"having to allocate crews to put out median strip fires because a motorist has carelessly flicked a cigarette butt, means we have to draw resources away from where we may really need them,\" he said. queensland's winter sizzle the weather bureau says about 20 centres in the state's west - including birdsville and bedourie - hit record august temperatures on saturday of 38 degrees in brisbane yesterday the mercury climbed to 28 degrees, while in ipswich the temperatures topped 32 degrees. \"after that the winds ease off into tuesday, although it's still dry and temperatures are still high, though not as high,\" mr holcombe said. \"beyond that, tuesday night should be cooler, with cooler weather to follow on wednesday and thursday .\" mr holcombe said persistent northwesterly winds blowing for the northern territory and a series of troughs were blocking the usual southerly change. simply log in below to start commenting on articles .) please check the following fields before continuing: i understand that submission of this comment is covered by the you need to

the first quarter. he sprinted around right end for 18 more to start the second quarter. he went 35 yards to the left side on his next carry in a stretch that he said reminded him of high school. oakland raiders, which still had most of its starters in the game at the time. after spending much of the offseason trying to improve a leaky run defense, oakland was exposed by the san francisco 49ers on saturday. now the raiders have three weeks to get things right before san diego chargers arrive for opening night. \"i don't know if you are going to sell the farm and move, but there is definitely concern, definitely things we have to clean up,\" linebacker <mark>thomas howard</mark> said. \"i was disappointed with the run. things need to change. things must be cleaned up, definitely .\" since going to the super bowl following the 2002 season, oakland has had the worst run defense in the nfl, allowing 141.7 yards per game on the ground and 122 touchdowns rushing. the raiders have allowed a 100-yard rusher in more than half of their games the past three years, with journeymen backs such as kolby smith reaching the mark. after watching a third-round rookie, coffee, gash them for 129 yards on 16 carries, and a sometime fullback in <mark>michael robinson</mark> add 97 more on 14 carries, it's back to work for the raiders. oakland gave up 275 yards on 47 carries, with star frank gore providing only 7 on his two carries. \"i thought we had some guys not play very well,\" coach tom cable said sunday. \"we have to do a better job adjusting to it as coaches, and then, two, i think you have to at some point set your jaw and decide you're not going to get your rear end kicked like that .\" what was particularly galling for oakland was the niners kept hitting them with the same play, pulling offensive linemen around the end to create big holes. the raiders were unable to make the needed adjustments during the game to solve those issues. \"we are just going to look at it, and i'm pretty sure the coach is going to come up with a solution to make sure that doesn't happen again,\" defensive end <mark>greg ellis</mark> said. \"it wasn't like they were able to run any play and get yards on us; that one play we just didn't handle well. then they did what anybody should do, they kept repeating it, one side to another, and they kept having success with it .\" the raiders will have to shore up their run defense without their leading tackler from the past three seasons for about two weeks. linebacker <mark>kirk morrison</mark> dislocated his left elbow in the first quarter and will miss two weeks. <mark>morrison</mark> could play in the final exhibition game at seattle on sept. 3, or more likely wait until the season opener. <mark>morrison</mark> was already in danger of losing his starting job to <mark>ricky brown</mark>, who had seven tackles and an interception saturday. cable said <mark>morrison</mark> was in the lead at the time of the injury. \"we have a few things to shore up, but we have a good system in place,\" <mark>brown</mark> said. \"once everybody buys into it, the sky's the limit for us, you'll see .\" jon alston for the
