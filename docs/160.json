war london? former british prime minister <mark>gordon brown</mark> on monday accused a rupert murdoch-owned tabloid of personally attacking him, failing the british people and undermining the war in afghanistan through its coverage of the conflict. in an often bitter attack on the murdoch press in testimony to britain's media ethics inquiry, <mark>brown</mark> directly contradicted murdoch's claim that the then-prime minister had made an abusive phone call to the media mogul in 2009. murdoch told the inquiry last month that <mark>brown</mark> had vowed to \"make war on your company\" after the sun switched its support to the conservatives. \"it didn't happen,\" said <mark>brown</mark>, adding that he had been shocked to hear murdoch make the allegation under oath. murdoch's news international fired back, saying in a statement that the mogul stood by his testimony. <mark>brown</mark> is the first in a string of current and former political leaders to appear this week at the inquiry, set up amid a tabloid phone hacking scandal to examine malpractice in the media and ties among politicians, police and the press. among the issues the inquiry is addressing is whether newspapers have too much power over the political agenda. <mark>brown</mark> told the judge-led inquiry that the sun newspaper was guilty of \"the conflation of fact and opinion\" in its coverage of the afghanistan conflict and of his premiership. he said that instead of covering the difficult decisions facing his government, the sun had concluded \"that i personally did not care about our troops in afghanistan .\" he said the newspaper had made a series of spurious claims, for example that he had fallen asleep during a service of remembrance for dead troops. <mark>brown</mark> said he had been bowing his head in prayer. <mark>brown</mark> asserted that the sun's coverage had done \"huge damage\" to the war effort. the former prime minister said the press had \"failed this country\" by focusing on opinions and ephemera when the war in afghanistan was at a crucial stage. \"i'm afraid half the country (afghanistan) is falling into the hands of the taliban,\" <mark>brown</mark> said, accusing the press of failing to reflect this. the sun's political editor, tom newton dunn, denied <mark>brown</mark>'s allegations, saying on twitter that the newspaper had given the conflict prominent coverage. \"military loathed <mark>brown</mark> because they felt he didn't care about them. sun reported that, but <mark>gordon</mark> rewrites history to shoot the messenger,\" he tweeted. <mark>brown</mark> had a testy relationship with the powerful murdoch press during his 2007-2010 term in office. the sun, renowned for its political clout, backed the conservative party over <mark>brown</mark>'s labour in the 2010 national election. the election ejected <mark>brown</mark> from power and produced a conservative-liberal democrat coalition government. two years on, <mark>brown</mark> appeared bruised by his relationship with a press that often characterized him as prickly and awkward. <mark>brown</mark> also spoke of his pain at seeing leaked details of his young son's health splashed in the tabloid. the sun revealed in 2006 that <mark>brown</mark>'s infant son fraser had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. <mark>brown</mark> said he and his wife sarah had been distressed by the leak? which apparently came from a hospital worker? but acknowledged that sarah had remained friendly with rebekah brooks, the sun's then-editor, and even organized a 40th birthday party for her in 2008. \"i think sarah is one of the most forgiving people i know,\" <mark>brown</mark> said. \"i think she finds the good in everyone .\" brooks, 44, along with her husband and four aides, was charged last month with conspiring to pervert the course of justice in connection with the phone hacking scandal. they are the first people to be charged in the current investigation into tabloid wrongdoing, which has shaken britain's media, police and political establishments. more than 40 people have been arrested and questioned. the ethics inquiry was set up last year after revelations that the now-defunct news of the world had hacked the mobile phone voice mails of scores of celebrities, politicians and even crime victims in its quest for scoops. britain's current treasury chief, <mark>george osborne</mark>, testified later monday about his relationship with murdoch's media empire. prime minister <mark>david cameron</mark> faces questioning on thursday. <mark>osborne</mark> spent the early part of his testimony answering questions about his relationship to the murdoch family. he is also likely to be quizzed about his role in hiring a former editor of murdoch's scandal-tarred tabloid news of the world, andy coulson, as communications chief for the conservative party. after <mark>cameron</mark> became prime minister, coulson served as downing st. communications chief before resigning because of the scandal. ___ jill lawless can be reached at: subscribe to this comment thread by email cancel the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal

francisco--five things you need to know on the eve of the u.s. open: 1. back on track?: the defending champion arrives at olympic club off a seventh-place showing at last week's fedex st. jude classic. mcilroy's memphis finish may not have pleased him - he made double-bogey on the final hole after hitting his tee shot into the water - but 71 strong holes were a nice consolation, considering he'd missed his previous three cuts. mcilroy finished three shots behind winner <mark>dustin johnson</mark> at tpc southwind. \"it was important for me,\" mcilroy said. \"that was the whole reason to go to memphis last week, was to try to get some competitive golf and to feel like i shot a couple of good scores. and i saw some really positive signs out there .\" i definitely feel more comfortable about my game going into this week (than) if i hadn't have played. \"??? 2. three of a kind: mcilroy will tee off at 1:29 p.m. thursday. he's paired with <mark>luke donald</mark> and lee westwood in a grouping of the world's top three players. it's an impressive collection of talent, but probably not the group that will garner the most attention during the open's first round. no, most eyes will be on tiger woods, phil mickelson and bubba watson, who tee off at 7:33 a.m. woods, seeking his first major since the 2008 u.s. open at torrey pines, is coming off a victory at memorial. as we saw at augusta, he's still unpredictable as he undergoes swing changes with <mark>sean foley</mark>. mickelson is seeking his first open title after a record five runners-up, most recently in 2009. watson, the masters champion, said,\" it's going to be like sunday at the masters, huge galleries. \"watson is still adjusting to life as a father and major champion, but there's one aspect of olympic club that suits him .\" you have to curve it more off the tees here than any other golf course that we play, \"woods said .??? 3. rough start: don't be upset if your favorite player gets off to a poor start at olympic club. the course's first six holes make for a brutal opening stretch. watson played those holes 2 over in a practice round,\" and i made some good par putts, \"he said\" if you can get through there (even-par), it's like you're shooting well under par, almost like you birdied all the holes, \"watson said .\" if i shot 2 over every single day in the four days, i'd be pretty happy. \"olympic club's first hole, a par-5 in the first four u.s. opens at olympic, will play as a 520-yard par-4. no. 2 is an uphill 428-yard, par-4 with a fairway that narrows at 270 yards, forcing many players to lay back off the tee. that's followed by a 247-yard par-3 with a green well-protected by bunkers. the fourth hole is an uphill 438-yard, par-4 with a fairway that slopes severely from left-to-right, making it difficult for tee shots to stay in the short grass. the fifth and sixth holes are par-4s of 498 and 489 yards, respectively .\" i've heard that first six come up a few times, \"steve stricker said .\" but i kind of chuckle because they're all pretty good. \"??? 4. what a finish: players will have a chance to end their rounds on a high note, though. nos. 16 and 17 are olympic club's only par-5s, while the 18th is a 344-yard par-4 with a green whose slope has been softened since the 1998 debacle. players have an opportunity to pick up a couple birdies on this closing trio .\" it gives you a chance to finish off a round, \"woods said .\" you're trying to make a bunch of pars throughout most of the day, and then all of a sudden you've got to change gears. \"if you hit two good shots into 16 you're going to have a wedge in there, which you should make birdie. same thing on 17. and same thing on 18. you have three holes back-to-back either you're chipping, you're wedging, so you're going to have to make some birdies there, absolutely .\" this is a u.s. open, though, so there are no easy holes. the 16th has been lengthened to 670 yards, making it the longest par-5 in u.s. open history. watson, the pga tour's leader in driving distance, said he still had 60 yards remaining to 16 after hitting driver-driver. mickelson said he has yet to have an approach shorter than 200 yards into the 16th. players who drive in the rough on the severe dogleg-left will struggle to reach the green in three. \"i believe that you play 15 holes of really tough, tough golf,\" mickelson said. \"and you finally get your first par-5 and it's the toughest hole on the course .\" ??? 5. kuchar's return: matt kuchar returns to olympic club, where 14 years ago he was a grinning amateur who charmed fans and contended for a major. he finished 14th at the 1998 open at olympic, the year after he won the u.s. amateur. kuchar is back this year after contending at the year's first major and winning the largest title of his career, the players championship. \"that still amazes me to be 14 years ago,\" kuchar said. \"i remember finishing rounds of golf and just being flat-out exhausted .\" ", "articleID": "2012061317_00108555_W", "names": {"Chad Campbell": ["Q1058564", "Q16214361"], "Dustin Johnson": ["Q1002293", "Q30015838"], "John Merrick": ["Q28232785",

with the board, every institution except the university of florida asked the governors for the maximum increase allowed under the state's \"differential tuition\" law. uf decided to ask for a 9 percent increase after president bernie machen and some of the school's trustees expressed unease with going to the full 15 percent. the university of south florida initially told the board it would seek a 15 percent increase, but later trustees decided it will instead ask for an 11 percent increase. but the universities' requests also include forecasts that, without additional state funding, the schools will likely ask for 15 percent increases again in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 budget years, though those predictions are not binding and are tied to built-in assumptions about future state spending. the forecasts don't include uf, because its board voted on its request later than other universities. the board of governors is expected to vote on the recommendations thursday, at the end of three days of meetings that will include in-depth reviews of each university's plan for the next three years. many of the universities stressed the benefits of the additional tuition dollars they have received in recent years and the added funds they would draw down under the plans. florida a & m university, for example, said it was able to offer 859 classes that otherwise wouldn't have been offered during the 2011-12 school year without differential tuition dollars. florida international university wrote that it would use $13.3 million to hire undergraduate faculty with an eye on increasing graduate rates. that would be by far the lion's share of the money, with only $12.3 million earmarked for financial aid coming close. on the other hand, universities warned of dire consequences if the board doesn't approve their requests. \"there will be a significant negative impact on availability of required general education course sections, students' ability to obtain required courses, resulting in inability to continue education, larger class sizes, decreased graduation rates, increased time to degree and excess hours from taking unnecessary courses if required courses are not available,\" famu wrote. florida atlantic university said it would be forced to cut 75 faculty positions, nine advisors and 500 classes if the differential tuition increases aren't approved. and the university of central florida said its already-rising class size would increase even faster. \"without differential tuition, the university of central florida's ability to continue to provide high-quality access to undergraduate degrees is at risk,\" the request says. florida state raised the specter of an increasing exodus of faculty members, lured to other states by higher salaries. the requests from universities also show how the schools have used the 30 percent of the funding required to be devoted to need-based financial aid. in some cases, the amounts given to individual students vary widely, with 752 students at florida gulf coast university receiving anywhere between $50 and $6,482. the average award at fgcu was $1,847. the push comes at the same time that scott has pushed universities not to boost tuition. in a radio interview earlier this month, scott--who is set to meet with the board on tuesday--repeated his hesitance about increase the costs of college. \"we cannot continue to raise tuition constantly on the backs of our families,\" scott told 97.3 the sky radio in gainesville. \"they cannot afford it ....i'm against raising tuition .\"
