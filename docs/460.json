Show Caption Previous Next TUCSON, Ariz. - It's been more than a year in the making, but Jesse Owens Park on Tucson's east side is nearly complete. While some parts are fenced off and still being renovated, much of the park has come back to life, like the baseball and softball fields. Debi Beatty, who's son plays on the field, feels that he can now play safely. \"They can play on that field without falling in holes,\" she said. \"It's great .\" About a year ago, Beatty approached her City Council representative, Ward 2's <mark>Paul Cunningham</mark>, and KGUN9 On Your Side, explaining she felt that the park was in a state of disrepair. Soon afterwards, the park began to transform. But this past April, well into renovations, Beatty didn't think the park would be ready for the summertime. \"No,\" she said. \"No. . Not at all .\" But now, with much of it usable, she's on board and pleased with the progress. \"They're really kicking some booty out here,\" Beatty said. \"I mean, look at the fields, they're awesome .\" <mark>Cunningham</mark> says this project was long overdue. \"It's really coming together,\" he said. \"There's no use in having a park if no one is going to use it .\" Once all of the pieces are complete, including the pool, parking lot, and basketball court, <mark>Cunningham</mark> has high hopes for the future of Jesse Owens Park. That being said, he is asking people in the area to be patient and stick to the parts that are totally complete for now, so that the grass will grow in well. \"Try to curb that use just a little bit longer, as the monsoon comes in and we get the benefit of the rain,\" <mark>Cunningham</mark> said. \"When we do re-open we'll have a lush, green park. I'm really excited about it and I think so is the neighborhood .\" The City Council member explained the nearly $2 million for the project came from seven different sources. <mark>Cunningham</mark> plans to have a soft re-opening for Jesse Owens Park sometime in August. Beatty plans to be there, and is looking forward to the future of the park. \"We all worked together, all came through. It's great,\" she said. \"This is just the beginning of what its going to be. It's amazing already, can you imagine it in another month?\" Copyright 2018 Scripps Media, Inc.. All rights reserved.

A petition, prepared by the PTI, states the NADRA chief was appointed by the former government and hence, as long as he is there, free and fair elections will not be possible.

More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents, according to The New York Times. \"When you take a child away from the parents, from the home, from everything that they know, they are never the same,\" Goldstein said in the video, adding that many children separated from their parents during the Holocaust had still not overcome the trauma. \"Most hidden children are now in their late 70s, 80s, some are even 90, and they still think about it, and it still hurts, it still aches,\" she said.

(John Moore/Getty Images via JTA) The new policy dictates that every migrant who crosses the United States border illegally will be prosecuted and detained. Since children cannot be prosecuted with adults, they are reclassified as unaccompanied minors and taken away. <mark>Trump</mark> administration officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, say it's a necessary measure to enforce border security. Since many of the migrants have ended up in detention centers and temporary shelters, some have compared the policy to Nazi-era actions. Sessions on Tuesday called those comparisons exaggerated. A broad spectrum of Jewish groups have spoken out against the policy, along with many other religious organizations. \"It's wrong, it's wrong,\" Goldstein said. \"How can this happen in the 21st century?\" read more: Jewish Times ADL Anti-Defamation League Holocaust immigration policy Holocaust survivors <mark>Donald Trump</mark> asylum seekers United States Facebook Twitter email Print 0 shares comments", "articleID": "2018062020_00164441_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}}, {"date": "2018-06-20", "url": "http://nbr.co.nz/article/wall-street-calm-us-drops-out-unhrc-ns-p-216462", "content": "Wall Street calm as US drops out of UNHRC <mark>Nathan Smith</mark> Thursday June 21, 2018 Play NBR radio on Wall Street was buoyed mostly by large NASDAQ gains as fears of a US/China trade war dissipate.

The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US decision against \"this prejudiced body\" in a message on Twitter yesterday.

Cohen. \"I think it's a disgrace .\" The entrance for the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children on Monday, June 18, 2018. Ellis Rua | [email protected] By Carol Marbin Miller 24 minutes ago During the day, Franky Santos attends meetings for people trying to get clean, occasionally performs community service, and appears regularly before the Miami judge who oversees the county's Drug Court. At night, he's a caregiver for immigrant children being held at a Homestead shelter. As controversy continues to swirl over the Trump administration's immigration policy--even after it walked back a decision to separate undocumented immigrant children from their parents and house them in shelters--a new question looms: Who's minding the kids? Though children's advocates and human rights groups have criticized the administration's decision to house even small children in shelters--some of which include chain-link fencing likened to cages--Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other administration officials have insisted that the youngsters are well-cared for. In Homestead, it turns out, some of the youngsters are, or were, being cared for by a 38-year-old man who is in Miami-Dade's Drug Court facing pending felony drug possession charges. On Monday, Franky Santos appeared before Circuit Judge Jeri B. Cohen, who is overseeing his case in drug court. Santos told the judge he had just been hired as a \"lead youth care worker\" at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' compound in Homestead. \"I watch over the children,\" he said, to \"make sure they don't sneak off or go anywhere where they're not supposed to .\" The judge, who had presided over child welfare cases for more than a decade, appeared to be surprised at Santos' new job. \"People with open criminal cases should not be watching children that we have in holding facilities in our country,\" she said. \"I think it's a disgrace .\" \"I'm just shocked, although I shouldn't be,\" she added. Santos said he works at the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children, a 1,000-bed center for children who have entered the U.S. without permission. The shelter was shuttered last year when the number of unaccompanied youths being held there declined. But it was reopened in recent weeks just as the Trump administration announced it would hold children separately from their families if the parents faced criminal prosecution for illegal entry. The administration's decision, reversed Wednesday, to separate children from their parents drew harsh rebukes from civil rights groups and children's advocates, especially after it was revealed that children at a Texas shelter were being housed within chain-link fencing that critics said resembled cages. <mark>George Sheldon</mark>, a former secretary of the Florida Department of Children & Families who now heads Miami's private foster care agency, Our Kids, called the policy \"obscene .\" \"There's no word I can use to describe what I think is an extremely inhumane policy,\" <mark>Sheldon</mark> added. Said U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist: \"This is indefensible. Stunning and disappointing, to say the least .\" \"I know the president signed what appears to be a reversal, but there are a lot of problems still left hanging, sadly,\" the St. Petersburg Democrat said Thursday. \"Where are the 2,300 children that were already removed, and how will they be returned. And, obviously, some of the employees watching them may be questionable. It's one thing after another after another. When you launch a bad policy, it only gets worse. This is a nightmare for our country, but, most importantly, for these children .\" The administration had defended the practice, and leaders at the Justice Department, Homeland Security and elsewhere insisted youngsters were well-cared for. \"It is important to note that these minors are very well taken care of--don't believe the press,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told the National Sheriff's Association, while addressing reports of substandard treatment of minors. And although the Trump administration says it will no longer separate children from their parents at the border, immigrant advocates insist it will be difficult to reunify the more than 2,000 children who already are held in shelters after being removed from their families. It's impossible to say whether the private company that operates the Homestead shelter was aware of Santos' legal troubles and hired him anyway--as Santos claimed in court--or failed to perform a background check. Comprehensive Health Services Inc., which operates the Homestead shelter under contract with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, declined to comment, referring questions to HHS. A spokesman for HHS, which oversees the youth shelters, did not reply to requests from the Miami Herald to discuss the Homestead shelter. <mark>Sheldon</mark> oversaw the development of shelters for immigrant children beginning in 2012, when he was assistant secretary at the U.S. Administration for Children & Families at HHS under the Obama administration. He said the contracts his agency inked required providers to vet the men and woman who were in caregiver roles with children. \"This raises the question of how good their background screening is,\" <mark>Sheldon</mark> said. \"There have got to be federal regulations in that contract .\" Comprehensive Health Services, which is one of the largest providers of workforce medical services, has been criticized in the past for its performance while under contract with U.S. government agencies. Last year, the Justice Department announced CHS had agreed to pay the U.S. government $3.8 million to settle a complaint under the False Claims Act that it had double-billed and mischarged the Internal Revenue Service as part of a contract to provide medical services to IRS criminal investigation agents. The Justice Department said CHS double-billed for vision screenings, electrocardiograms and blood tests between April 2009 and April 2014. \"Businesses that knowingly overcharge the government should be held accountable and penalized,\" then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein said. The top federal prosecutor in Baltimore at the time, Rosenstein now is deputy attorney general. In 2012, an Arkansas man and woman sued a subsidiary of CHS, claiming they'd been fired by the company after they complained that the subsidiary had provided \"substandard care\" to personnel at Sather Air Force Base, now known as Baghdad Diplomatic Support Hospital, in Iraq as part of a contract with the U.S. State Department. In their lawsuit, the two claimed a man died after a \"critical care practitioner\" botched the insertion of a breathing tube. The lawsuit was later settled. In August of last year, Santos was pulled over for speeding in Key Largo when an officer smelled what he thought was marijuana in Santos' Jeep. An officer found more than 20 grams of the drug in a gym bag in Santos' trunk. Santos agreed to enter drug court, and his case was transferred to Miami-Dade County. Other arrests included a 2008 misdemeanor marijuana charge, for which adjudication was withheld, a 2008 misdemeanor loitering charge, which was dropped, and a 2012 misdemeanor domestic battery charge, which also was dropped. At a hearing Monday, Santos was upbeat when asked how he was doing. \"I'm doing great,\" he said. \"I just recently got a new job for the government .\" Santos said he was overseeing children aged 12-17 who were detained at the U.S. border. \"It's not a public thing,\" he said. \"I'm not even really supposed to talk about it .\" Training for the job consisted of \"an orientation class,\" Santos said. \"It's like a daycare,\" he added. \"They just want you to observe the children, make sure that they're not...acting crazy or just being rude or--they just want to keep control and make sure that they're not doing anything out of the usual .\" Santos said the company was aware he was facing felony drug charges when it hired him. A representative of the county's drug court program said in court that Santos had tested positive for marijuana on Monday--not his first failed test, court records show. . Santos said the test was picking up marijuana he had smoked in mid-April, but Cohen said the substance would not be detected after so many weeks. \"No, that's impossible,\" the judge said. \"Marijuana doesn't stay in the system 60 days .\" \"Can you give me two weeks, and I will come up clean?\" Santos asked. \"I just want you to be honest,\" the judge replied. It's unclear whether Santos still has the job at the Homestead shelter; Cohen said in court he should quit and look for another job that doesn't entail caring for children. Before concluding the hearing, Cohen offered her opinion on the government's system for overseeing kids: \"The United States government should be hanging its head in shame,\" she said. It's \"disgusting that they would hire someone with an open felony to watch children .\" Herald writer Aaron Leibowitz and researcher Monika Z. Leal contributed to this report.

Washington Post photo by <mark>John McDonnell</mark> Barry Trotz resigned from the Washington Capitals on Monday, June 18, just 11 days after he and the team won the franchise's first Stanley Cup. He was spotted wearing a suit at the Newark airport later that afternoon, fueling speculation he was meeting with the New York Islanders, the only team that had a head-coaching vacancy. Three days later, Trotz became the Islanders' new coach while the Capitals have yet to name his replacement. Once Washington accepted Trotz's resignation, there were no restrictions on where he could coach, and his move to a Metropolitan Division opponent the Capitals will play at least four times a year stings. Trotz and Washington's split was largely related to financial differences; Trotz asked for a five-year term with a $5 million annual salary, a significant bump from the $1.5 million he was reportedly making each of the past four years with the team. MacLellan said the term especially was \"a sticking point\" because it would have secured Trotz as coach of the Capitals for nine seasons, and that kind of tenure with a team is rare. \"It's a long time and a lot of money to be committing to a coach,\" MacLellan said Monday. \"There are probably four guys that are making that money, so it's the upper echelon. It's the big-revenue teams .\" New York and new general manager Lou Lamoriello got closer to Trotz's price with a deal believed to be in the neighborhood of $20 million for five years, according to Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman. The Islanders have missed the playoffs the past two seasons, but New York was one the highest-scoring teams in the league last season. Hiring Trotz, the fifth-winningest coach all time, will likely be part of the team's pitch for retaining pending free agent center <mark>John Tavares</mark>. Known for coaching good defensive structure, Trotz could help a team that allowed the most goals in the league last season. The Islanders are also considered a possible trade destination for Capitals goaltender Philipp Grubauer. Washington superstars Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom expressed disappointment over Trotz's resignation Wednesday night at the NHL Awards in Las Vegas, but both wished him well and praised his positive impact on them. \"Something you can't take away from Barry is what he's done to this team,\" Backstrom said. \"Him and the coaching staff has been doing a tremendous job to just get us together. He's been schooling us good these four years, and we got a good finish out of it...Hopefully there's no hard feelings. He's always going to be remembered in Washington as a champion, which is great, which he deserves .\" Said Ovechkin: \"He's been very good for me. We've been back and forth all the time, you know? He was hard on me. He give me very good advice because he have experience and that's the whole thing. When the coach know who you are and know how to use you, you just feel great .\" Along with the franchise's first Stanley Cup, Trotz guided the Capitals to back-to-back Presidents' Trophy-winning seasons and three division titles. Washington advanced to the second round of the playoffs in all four seasons he was with the team. Though MacLellan said there's no time frame to name Trotz's replacement, Capitals associate coach Todd Reirden is the overwhelming favorite to get the job, and that Washington seemed to be grooming him for the role for the past year created tension in the relationship between Trotz and the organization. Assistant coach Lane Lambert and Capitals director of goaltending Mitch Korn had followed Trotz to Washington from their previous stop in Nashville, and it's likely they will now join him in New York.
