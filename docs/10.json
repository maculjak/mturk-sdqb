(ap photo/charles rex arbogast) by beth fouhy associated press writer / january 24, 2009 email | print | single page | | text size - + new york - the departure of four sitting democratic senators this year has cast a new--and at times, unflattering--light on the nation's governors and their outsize power to fill senate vacancies. while governors must call a special election to replace members of the house who resign or die before their term is up, 38 states allow governors the sole power to appoint an interim senator, according to the national council of state legislatures. just nine states require a special election to fill a senate vacancy. in three other states--hawaii, utah and wyoming--governors must select a candidate from a list of prospective appointees submitted by representatives of the departing incumbent's political party. choosing a new senator has led to considerable drama for the four governors tasked with doing so this year. all have weathered some level of opprobrium for their choices or for how they handled the selection, with one--rod blagojevich of illinois--facing criminal charges for trying to barter president barack obama's former seat for cash and favors. \"politically, the choices made by the governors so far have been pretty odd,\" said seth masket, an assistant professor of political science at the university of denver. most recently, new york gov. <mark>david paterson</mark> engaged in a messy, drawn-out effort to name a replacement for hillary rodham clinton, obama's secretary of state. the process was largely dominated by a high-profile lobbying campaign by caroline kennedy, the 51-year-old daughter of president john f. kennedy hoping to win the nod. <mark>paterson</mark> spent weeks vacillating publicly about kennedy, at turns praising her intelligence while criticizing her lack of experience. the governor hinted openly that he would choose kennedy, then contradicted himself later by saying he was still considering other candidates. for her part, kennedy appeared tentative and unprepared, and she abruptly withdrew her name from consideration for the seat thursday. her departure launched a war of recriminations between her allies and <mark>paterson</mark>'s--a spectacle that suggested <mark>paterson</mark> had somehow lost control over the selection process. <mark>paterson</mark> announced friday he had selected rep. kirsten gillibrand, a moderate from the upstate region. but even that choice produced its share of grumbling. rep. carolyn mccarthy, citing gillibrand's opposition to gun control, vowed to challenge her in the 2010 democratic primary, or to find another candidate to do so. mccarthy came to congress after her husband was killed and son wounded during a shooting rampage on the long island railroad in 1993. gillibrand is also largely unknown in voter-rich new york city and its suburbs, where most of the state's democrats live. \"gillibrand seems fine for her district, but this is a state where liberals can actually win statewide,\" masket said. \"it's not clear why the governor wouldn't pick someone more liberal .\" in illinois, blagojevich prevailed in a high-stakes game of chicken with democratic leaders by naming former illinois attorney general roland burris to obama's seat. senate democrats had insisted that any candidate blagojevich named would not be considered a legitimate replacement. they eventually relented and allowed burris to be seated, but he remains tainted by his connection to blagojevich and may not be the strongest candidate to withstand a republican challenge in 2010. while less visible than the illinois and new york senate replacements, retiring delaware gov. ruth ann minner has withstood criticism for her choice to fill vice president joe biden's senate seat. and colorado gov. <mark>bill ritter</mark>'s choice of a replacement for ken salazar, now obama's interior secretary, has also mystified some. in delaware, minner selected longtime biden aide ted kaufman to serve until a special election in 2010. kaufman has made clear he will not run in the special election, clearing the way for biden's son beau, the state attorney general currently serving in iraq as a member of the delaware national guard. in appointing kaufman, a relative unknown to most delaware voters, minner passed over the state's popular lt. gov. <mark>john carney</mark>--reinforcing the notion that the seat belongs to the biden family and its loyalists. in colorado, <mark>ritter</mark> chose denver public schools superintendent michael bennet to succeed salazar, even though bennet has never run for statewide office and is virtually unknown beyond denver. the choice sets the stage for a strong republican push for the seat in 2010. despite the inevitable missteps, allowing governors to fill senate vacancies is generally a smart solution, said jeff bosworth, an assistant professor of history at mansfield university in pennsylvania. \"it's atypical to choose a senator this way, but it's worse to leave a state unrepresented for the time it takes to put together a special election,\" bosworth said. \"i can't see a better system than leaving it to the governor. they're elected, and if you don't like what they did, don't vote for them next time .\" \u00a9 copyright 2009 associated press. all rights reserved. this

players. i know dunn would get a long look for the dh role. the yanks could use a player like him and if he signed with a team now, for about $8 million (a steal), he could get a better deal in 2010

health unit\" won't hit homes bid' a multi-million pound day hospital for older mental patients will not affect future housing developments, claim planners. wrexham maelor hospital wants to build a two-storey older adult mental health unit off the northern side of croesnewydd road, close to hospital residential accommodation. it will have 28 in-patient beds and a 16-place day hospital and therapy spaces and will go before wrexham county borough council's planning committee on monday for approval. the proposal includes minor amendments to the site plan already approved for the adult mental health unit which adjoins the site. but concerns have been raised that the plans may compromise the application for housing nearby by morris homes. objectors claim the proposals are \"unclear\" and the scale, mass, bulk and character of the multi-storey could compromise the adjacent land the suspended ramp to the car park is described as unconventional and may raise health and safety concerns and could compromise problems of flooding on adjacent land. the car park should be set back to ensure no risk of flooding. but wrexham planners said: \"the building is of a high quality design and existing and proposed landscaping will ensure it is not overly dominant .\" they say it is also environmentally friendly. highway engineers are also satisfied it will not make traffic congestion worse. \"a previous permission allowed a two tiered decking system and this proposal seeks to provide an additional four levels,\" say planners. \"concern has been expressed from owners/developers of adjoining land at maesgwyn road that the car park may impact on future development which is subject of a current application. given the height of the development, proposed and existing screening and the distances to proposed development, over 60m, the car park will not have any significant impact on future residential amenity or in the wider landscape,\" say planners. meanwhile full details of a proposal for a residential care home for 72 elderly mentally infirm residents, on the former jacques garage site off mold road, will also go before the council for approval subject to conditions. the site, close to wrexham general station, was previously approved for apartments. but with little interest in regenerating the site for housing, planners believe the scheme would be an ideal opportunity to develop a key site near wrexham's town centre. the report to councillors said: \"the current application is one of two outline applications for extra care and emi residential care home on the former jacques site .\" a partnership between pennaf housing group and the council has submitted a formal bid to the welsh assembly government to provide \"social housing grant' for the new extra care scheme .\" this bid is currently under consideration and it is anticipated funding will be approved this year. \"a key part of this scheme is the close relationship of the new extra care scheme and the care home is that certain aspects of the accommodation will be closely linked and shared between the two developments .\" keep up to date with the news. sign up for

wednesday, february 4, 2009 at 5:01 p.m. montgomery, ala. (ap) - the federal stimulus package, which has received little support from alabama's congressional delegation, could ease the state's budget cuts and keep government operating at close to its current level, gov. <mark>bob riley</mark> said wednesday. with the stimulus, the budgets don't get worse. without the stimulus, they do and state government could see thousands of layoffs, the republican governor said as he recommended the state budget for fiscal 2010. <mark>riley</mark>, a former congressman, said he's not recommending any particular stimulus plan, but is encouraging congress to pass one because he considers it a crucial foundation for economic recovery. \"what everyone in this room wants is an expanding budget, not a contracting one,\" the governor said. the stimulus plan passed by the u.s. house was opposed 6-1 by alabama's delegation, and the state's two republican u.s. senators are against it now that it's pending in that chamber. the house-passed plan could pump about $3 billion into alabama over 2 1/2 years. <mark>riley</mark> said if the stimulus package fails, the education budget would drop from this year's $5.8 billion to $5.6 billion next year. with the package, it could jump to $6.2 billion because of federal aid. without the package, <mark>riley</mark> is recommending spending be cut 2.8 percent for grades kindergarten though 12th, and higher education reduced 3.5 percent. but that doesn't give a picture of the true cuts because education programs have already been sliced from the state's all-time record funding of $6.7 billion in fiscal 2008, which ended sept. 30. <mark>riley</mark> is recommending a $1.6 billion general fund budget for non-education agencies in the fiscal year that starts oct. 1. that's down from nearly $2 billion this year. but his recommendation is based on the federal government giving alabama substantially more money for medicaid than this year. that would allow alabama to slice its share of medicaid funding by $353 million. most other state programs would get about the same amount as this year, and medicaid would be able to maintain its health care programs, <mark>riley</mark> said. <mark>riley</mark>'s recommendations come in the first week of a legislative session that ends in mid-may. he said the recommendations will be revised based on how congress handles the stimulus package and the flow of state tax collections this spring. for the administration, there is a bright spot. a state revenue department report released wednesday shows state tax collections in january were only 1 percent below the same month a year ago. in december, alabama experienced a 14 percent drop over the previous december. for october through january, the first four months of the state's fiscal year, alabama's tax collections were 4.4 percent below the same period a year ago. a member of the house government appropriations committee, rep. greg canfield, r-vestavia hills, said he expects legislators to delay work on the state budgets until late in the session to have the best financial information available.", "articleID": "2009020500_00000182_W", "names": {"Bob Riley": ["Q3641335", "Q438010"]}}, {"date": "2009-02-05", "url": "http://feeds.sfgate.com/click.phdo?i=bb663b1d1444cb127deadb94aad1042f", "content": "article: uc regents to vote on new admissions rules: / c/a/2009 / 02/04/mn7u15nebb. dtl \"the bottom line is that it will be more diverse and more fair,\" said uc president mark yudof. the full board is expected to approve these changes today:--sat subject tests would no longer be necessary .--the pool of applicants who'd be considered would widen, but the number guaranteed entry into one of the university's nine undergraduate campuses would shrink .--the top 9 percent of high school graduates statewide would be ensured entry, compared with 12.5 percent previously, as well as those in the top 9 percent of their graduating class - up from 4 percent in the past. taken together, the two groups would constitute 10.1 percent of california's graduating class, based on projections by the university. the revised requirements would affect the freshman class of 2012. the changes would allow high school students to be considered - and granted a full review of their application - who complete by the end of junior year at least 11 of 15 college prep courses required by uc, achieve a weighted 3.0 grade-point average, and take either the act plus writing or sat reasoning test.uc was the only public education system in the country that made students take two sat subject tests. the result: 22,000 high school graduates in california were disqualified in 2007 from applying to the university who otherwise would have been eligible. members of the uc academic senate, who spent almost four years putting together the eligibility proposal, based this estimate on 2007 data from the california postsecondary education commission. that data also made them conclude that 21.7 percent of high school graduates in the state would have been entitled to a comprehensive review of their applications in 2007, compared with the 13.4 percent who were actually eligible for uc in that period. \"this proposal will give us a chance to look at those (kinds of) lost students,\" said regent eddie island. \"they might not get in, but we'll look at them as individuals .\" the promise of uc admission to the top 12.5 percent of graduates goes back to the 1960 master plan for higher education. a few regents worried about deviating from such a venerable road map. \"i feel like i got out my lantern, like diogenes, looking for the master plan,\" yudof said. he emphasized that he had talked to legislators, california state university chief <mark>charles reed</mark> and community college leaders. \"they were all simpatico with this,\" yudof said. to avoid a perception that the university was lowering its standards, yudof had asked the creators of the proposal to raise the required gpa to a 3.0, weighted with honors courses, instead of an unweighted 2.8. that change was reflected in the plan the regents' committee on educational policy unanimously voted for on wednesday. although eligibility changes had been discussed in four earlier regents' meetings, there was still much confusion. \"now i can see why i was not uc eligible,\" said regent norman pattiz. \"how are we going to get this in a little pamphlet and hand it to parents to see what it takes?\" some people saw the shift - endorsed by the university of california student association - as a way to get around proposition 209, which was approved by voters in 1996 and ended race - and gender-based anti-discrimination programs in state, county and city hiring, contracting and school admissions. yudof said he supported affirmative action but would obey prop. 209 because it is the law. he was sure the new rules would increase diversity, but said it was too early to know the specific impact. \"we want to change the behavior of applicants and admissions officers,\" he said. and by looking at the \"whole file,\" as he put it, colleges can find out if a student did volunteer work or overcame a hardship or wrote the great american novel or climbed mount everest. although the changes dominated the meeting, few members of the public addressed them. most, instead, were angry about having to soon contribute to their retirement fund without being represented on the pension board. \"we won't pay without a say,\" they chanted. one protester was ellie corley, 72, an administrative assistant in the uc controller's office who has worked at the university for 33 years and makes $35,000 a year. she got laid off in january and will leave in march. kiss my boy scout gays! buddha! stemware! time to reinvent the scouts for the new world. pharm closes holistic drug store elephant pharm shutters all 3 bay area locations. kiss my boy scout gays! buddha! stemware! time to reinvent the scouts for...site index advertising services: sorry, comments are closed for this story.", "articleID": "2009020503_00041304_W", "names": {"Charles Reed": ["Q22106118", "Q5081968", "Q57412767"]}}]
