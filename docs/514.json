By Mick Akers / Las Vegas Review-Journal March 13, 2019 - 3:23 pm A Southwest Airlines plane takes off from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas Thursday, Oct. 25, 2018. K.M. Cannon Las Vegas Review-Journal @ KMCannonPhoto The Federal Aviation Administration's ordered grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircrafts in the U.S won't have much impact on Las Vegas. The decision to halt the MAX flights comes after the collection of new data and evidence at the Ethiopian crash site of Flight 302, which killed all 157 people on board, was analyzed, coupled with newly refined satellite data available to the FAA, according to a statement released by the administration. The impact at McCarran International Airport is expected to be light, as only 2 percent of the roughly 15,500 flights scheduled for March feature the MAX 8 jets, according to airport spokesman <mark>Chris Jones</mark>. \"It's not a massive piece of the day-to-day, in-and-out at McCarran, but obviously we want everybody to be safe and we want the situation to be resolved,\" he said Tuesday. Three North American carriers serving McCarran operate MAX planes: Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and WestJet, according to Christine Crews, McCarran spokeswoman. Three McCarran flights involved the MAX 8 jets Wednesday, all departing flights, with the last one taking off for Chicago at 11:23 a.m., according to flight tracking website Flight Aware. No MAX 9 flights operated in or out of McCarran Wednesday, according to Flight Aware. None of the MAX jets were at McCarran following the FAA grounding orders, Crews said. Any changes to the flight schedules associated with those planes is at the discretion of the individual airlines. \"They may choose to cancel flights, they might be able to switch out equipment and continue as scheduled,\" Crews said. Southwest plans to operate its flight schedule with every available aircraft in its fleet. Southwest is offering flexible rebooking policies, allowing for customers to rebook on alternate flights without any additional fees or fare differences within 14 days of their original date of travel between the original city pairs. United said in a statement about 40 flights feature the MAX 9 plane a day, and through a combination of spare aircraft and rebooking customers, they do not anticipate a significant operational impact. WestJet was rebooking customers slated for MAX 8 jets onto other flights, according to its website. The grounding will remain in effect pending further investigation of the crash in Ethiopia, which will include examining the flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders, The FAA said. A separate crash involving a MAX 8 jet occurred in Indonesia in October, killing all 189 people on board. Canada also ordered the grounding of the MAX planes Wednesday.

Picture: Google Published: 11:51 Wednesday 13 March 2019 Share this article Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter Sign up A driver, who accelerated his car at high speed hitting a man on the road outside a Fife pub, has been jailed. Ian Walle (36) took revenge after becoming involved in a dispute in the bar earlier that night. The victim was sent flying over the bonnet, hitting the windscreen and falling on to the road. Walle, of Groban, Leven, appeared for sentencing at Dunfermline Sheriff Court. He previously admitted that on May 13 last year at Methil Brae, Methil, he assaulted <mark>Mark Watson</mark> by driving a car at him whereby he was struck, went on to the bonnet and fell to the ground, all to his injury and to the danger of his life. The incident occurred outside the Kirkland Bar where both men had been earlier. The court heard there was a dispute between Walle and Mr <mark>Watson</mark>'s son over a debt. Depute fiscal Sarah Lumsden previously told the court that Mr <mark>Watson</mark> had been in the pub with friends on the night of the incident. Another customer was outside having a cigarette and saw Walle, who had been in the bar earlier, in a grey BMW parked across the road. Walle then asked this man to go into the bar and pass on a message to Mr <mark>Watson</mark> for him to go outside. \"The accused then accelerated away with his tyres screeching,\" said the depute. He drove along the road then stopped and turned so that he was facing towards the bar. He then \"drove at high speed with no effort to slow down\" towards Mr <mark>Watson</mark> who was standing on the road outside the bar by this time. \"Mr <mark>Watson</mark> was thrown on to the bonnet and rolled off on to the road. The car had a cracked windscreen and the accused drove off,\" added Ms Lumsden. Video: Kirkcaldy residents told of \u00a3 500,000 windfall on film The police were called and Mr <mark>Watson</mark> was on his feet outside the bar when the officers arrived. Officers later saw the BMW on fire in another part of Methil. The fire service had been called to the scene. The victim sustained a grazed shoulder and a bump to the head. He was treated by paramedics but did not have to attend hospital. The court was previously told by defence solicitor Gordon Martin that his client's position was that he had been assaulted in the pub toilet by Mr <mark>Watson</mark>. His solicitor at sentencing Emma Farmer said Walle had run up drugs debts because of a cocaine habit. Sheriff Charles MacNair told Walle: \"The use of a motor car as a weapon is extremely serious. It is only by the greatest of good fortune that the injuries were relatively minor and you also have a record of violence .\" The sheriff jailed Walle for nine months. He also banned him from driving for 28-and-a-half months. Get in touch and tell us your story Two in hospital after police car in three-car crash Gallery: Do you remember Fife in the 90s?

And now it's a topic of conversation inside the exclusive, gentlemen-only Melbourne Club, which has counted Australia's highest-ranked Catholic as a member since 1992. To be sure, it has been a week of headaches for Melbourne's coterie of blokes-only clubs, after Julian Burnside's on-air Damascus moment, deciding membership of an all-men club didn't fit with the brand of a Green-voting human rights defender. But the question of whether to let women on the members' roll is elementary compared to the weightier issue of what to do with a convicted sex offender who has already been given the privilege of joining. Advertisement The Melbourne Club's general committee did not respond to requests for comment on the status of Pell's membership. A club secretary also refused to confirm receipt of the questions. Pell is understood to have received his guernsey during his tenure as auxiliary bishop of Melbourne in 1992. Presumably his role afforded him honorary membership, a category sometimes provided gratis to senior members of the Defence Force, clergy, government and other fields of service. Other less decorated hopefuls--who pass the first requirement of possessing a Y chromosome--must be proposed and seconded, then supported by written references from seven additional referees, all of which have known the candidate for a minimum of 10 years. Credit: Matt Golding And that's all before the five-figure joining fee. Members say it's about weeding out the slouches. But those lucky enough to be admitted are expected to remain on their best behaviour for the entirety of their membership. Which means filing for bankruptcy can prompt a member to be turfed, as can adverse findings made by the courts. Members can't say if Pell will be sadder to give up the camaraderie, the annual turkey carve or access to what could be the city's prettiest courtyard and lawn, shaded by a fairy-lit, historically significant plane tree. But they are certain he'll miss the hospitality. He was often a guest in the club's hotel rooms on the second and third floors. Russelling up at AustralianSuper Don Russell always kept a curiously low profile, despite once being <mark>Paul Keating</mark>'s right-hand man. Now he's under consideration for a more public position--chairman of AustralianSuper, the country's largest superannuation fund, which manages more than $160 billion in savings. AustralianSuper's current chairwoman, former Reserve Bank board member Heather Ridout, was appointed to the position five years ago and her term will soon be up (although we have no doubt any future Labor governments will find her work). Old mates: <mark>Paul Keating</mark> and his former adviser Don Russell, who is in contention for the chair at AustralianSuper. Credit: AAP In addition to his time with <mark>Keating</mark>, Russell has had a gig at West AM and chaired State Super. Meanwhile, industry-backed funds have been increasingly contested territory as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg moves to seek new powers to stop apparent union activism. Ridout earlier this month declared AustralianSuper--which manages funds for members of the Australian Workers' Union and others--would not be \"dragged into industrial relations\" , but also accused the government of making retirement savings political. It's unclear whether Russell's appointment has been given the green light already, but his name has certainly been floated as the odds-on successor to Ridout. An announcement could come soon. Shaking the can and sharing the spoils The rattling noise filtering through the state is audible to anyone, as all the Liberal and Labor heavyweights in town attempt to fill the coffers ahead of their election efforts.
