at the last frankfurt book fair. when i was waiting to meet people for dinner, i crashed the fancy hanser party, right during the time when michael kruger was introducing all the famous guests who were in the audience. i was circling around the back, trying to make myself invisible, when suddenly kruger pointed right at me and said, \"and we even have the recipient of the german book trade peace prize in the audience!\" everyone-truly everyone-turned to stare right through my guilty-looking self and applaud <mark>david grossman</mark>, who was quite literally, right behind me...anyway, hopefully knopf will send us a review copy at some point...and in terms of award announcements, we might have more about the reviewed by tim nassau literary critic edmund wilson, writing in the 1930s,

initiative, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. figures obtained by this newspaper through freedom of information requests reveal the full, mind-boggling cost of the private finance initiative (pfi) upon which the last government relied to fund its public sector infrastructure projects. more than 900 schemes have been completed with a total capital value of? 56 billion - yet the amount the taxpayer will have to repay currently stands at? 229 billion. that is the kind of interest rate a sink-estate loan shark would be proud of. in one particularly egregious example of how not to negotiate a contract, the princess royal university hospital in bromley in kent cost the contractor? 118 million to build but the final cost to the nhs will be? 1.2 billion. the pfi was actually conceived by <mark>john major</mark>'s conservative government but it was during <mark>gordon brown</mark>'s decade-long stint as chancellor of the exchequer that it really took flight. by using private sector firms to build and manage public sector facilities, it allowed labour to proceed far more quickly with its hospital and school-building programme. it had the added attraction for the chancellor of keeping vast amounts of state spending off the government's books. in theory, such a scheme makes sense - but only if the contracts are expertly negotiated and rigorously managed. unfortunately, such disciplines are as rare as hens' teeth in whitehall. what we had instead was the economics of the mad house, with private companies pocketing enormous profits and leaving the taxpayer to spend the next half century paying off the bills. in an interview in september 2002, mr <mark>brown</mark> defended the pfi with the words: \"i've got evidence that we are achieving value for money .\" perhaps he would care to share it with us. last week, the commons public accounts committee reported that when considering new hospitals or housing, the department of health and the department for communities and local government were given no alternative to the pfi, regardless of value for money. the treasury, to its great discredit, appeared to be working hand in glove with contractors to drive deals through. it was selfish? and wrong? of lady warsi to give that speech", "articleID": "2011012420_00029953_W", "names": {"Gordon Brown": ["Q10648", "Q1537981", "Q18763895",
