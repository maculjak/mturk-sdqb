Little League International announced Wednesday that it is vacating all of the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West squad's wins from last year's tournament, including from the Great Lakes regionals and U.S. championship, because some of its players lived outside its assigned boundaries. Mountain Ridge Little League, out of Las Vegas, officially becomes the 2014 U.S. champ in its place. The international youth baseball organization also suspended <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West's manager, ousted the local district administrator and barred the program from tournament play. Reflecting on what he called \"a heartbreaking decision,\" Little League International President Stephen Keener said the Chicago team's players can still be proud of what they accomplished last year. \"But it is unfortunate that the actions of adults have led to this outcome,\" Keener added. \"...As painful as this is, we feel it a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the Little League program. No team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries .\" <mark>Brandon Green</mark>, a player on the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West team, said the players weren't involved in anything that should cause the squad to be stripped of its title. \"We know that we're champions, our parents know that we're champions...and Chicago knows we're champions,\" he said at a news conference. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Keener and the two spoke for 10 minutes, a spokeswoman for the mayor, Kelley Quinn, said. Emanuel told the Little League official that the players didn't deserve to be punished. The organization should have sanctioned the adults, he said. \"You have turned them into the perpetrators when they are the victims,\" Emanuel told him, according to his spokeswoman. \"You know what they have done for Chicago, and let's face it, you know what they've done for your tournament .\" Named for the icon who broke baseball's color barrier and consisting entirely of African-Americans, the <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West squad proved that, despite talk to the contrary, baseball was not dead among inner-city youth. The Illinois team earned raves after knocking out Sports Illustrated cover girl Mo \"ne Davis' Philadelphia team and rolling to the U.S. championship contest. It entered that game as an underdog to Las Vegas, which had beaten every team it faced--including crushing Chicago by a 13-2 score. The title game was a much more even affair. The two squads swapped leads before Chicago jumped ahead for good with a three-run fifth inning en route to a 7-5 win. In the World Series final the following day, <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West rallied late but couldn't overcome the eventual champions from South Korea. That loss didn't halt the positive feelings about the team. Everyone from former Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer <mark>Frank Thomas</mark> and longtime Obama adviser <mark>David Axelrod</mark> cheered their success. Emanuel credited\" their positive attitude and success on the field (for rallying) people from every neighborhood. \"The team was celebrated with a parade through their hometown and even a visit to the White House in November, where they met President Barack Obama, a Chicago resident. At the time of the Washington visit, local Little League officials were already investigating thanks to a tip from a neighboring district's official and documentation. Little League International initially determined that all of <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West's players were eligible. In the middle of December, though,\" Little League began to learn of multiple issues with boundary maps and operational process with multiple leagues in Illinois District 4, \"the international organization said in a statement. Several more meetings followed, including one on January 31 when several issues came up, including that\" <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West Little League used a falsified boundary map for their 2014 tournament and that <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West Little League officials met with other leagues in District 4 to try to get the territory they wrongfully claimed was theirs for their 2014 tournament. \"\"During our review, it became clear that both <mark>Jackie Robinson</mark> West officials and (the) District Administrator...signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been,\" Keener said.

The RFP solicits proposals relating to the creation and implementation of a new municipal broadband utility to provide wireless and fiber optic internet services to the City of Fairlawn and the Akron-Fairlawn-Bath Township Joint Economic Development District. Known as FairlawnGig, this municipal broadband utility seeks to provide the residents, businesses, and visitors of Fairlawn with the benefits of the latest internet access technology and creativity available from the private sector. At a meeting held on February 9, the Fairlawn City Council unanimously approved a municipal ordinance authorizing the Mayor to issue the Request for Proposals. \"I thank the City Council for their foresight in approving this ordinance,\" said Fairlawn Mayor, William J. Roth, Jr. \"Broadband internet access is an essential utility for the 21st century. Through this initiative we will bring world class internet services to all residents and businesses of Fairlawn .\" The City hopes to realize this vision by soliciting proposals from qualified high technology companies who are willing to partner with the City to design, build, operate, manage, and maintain the FairlawnGig utility. In so doing, the City is not proposing any increases in taxes or other assessments. Rather, the City's broadband utility will be funded through private financing and revenues from operations. The City of Fairlawn has created a website for the FairlawnGig RFP process. The FairlawnGig RFP, along with news, information, and detailed instructions on how to participate in the RFP process is available at www.FairlawnGig.info.

This Newly-Named Anti-Gay Extremist Could Be The Next GOP Presidential Candidate Six months after the United States began a bombing campaign against ISIS, President Obama has asked Congress to pass a new\" Authorization of Military Force' to make it official. The proposal has a time-stamp of three years, places limits on the use of ground troops, and sunsets a Bush era AUMF from 2002 that authorized military action in Iraq. It's the administration's attempt to appease both Democrats' supposed uneasiness about endless war and Republicans' thirst for more of it. The truth is, it changes nothing. We can start with the most obvious opportunities for mission creep. The new proposed AUMF applies not only to ISIS but also \"associated persons or forces\" including any \"closely related successor entity\" ; there are no geographical boundaries set in the language; troop limits include the possibility of rescue operations, the use of Special Operations forces and don't adequately define what an \"enduring\" presence would mean, and despite the three year expiration date, it can always be reauthorized. Let's also not pretend that if Congress doesn't give it the go ahead, \"Operation Inherent Resolve\" will suddenly cease. The president will just continue on without official permission as he has done since September 2014. The more important aspect of the new proposal is what it leaves out: the 2001 AUMF remains untouched. Passed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the 2001 authorization is only 60 words long and yet it's become, as Gregory Johnsen called it, \"the most dangerous sentence in history .\" Originally intended to provide legal cover for hunting down those responsible for the attacks, the lethal phrasing has been manipulated to justify drone strikes and shadow wars in Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia and beyond. It's also not as simple as repealing the 2001 AUMF. This administration has argued that it has other tools at its disposal, including Article II of the US Constitution, which decrees the president the commander-in-chief. The world has become Obama's battlefield and neither American citizens nor innocent civilians are beyond his reach. Over the years he's been in office, the president's rhetoric has consistently failed to square up with his actions. Speaking from the White House this week, he said \"I do not believe America's interests are served by endless war, or by remaining on a perpetual war footing .\" This echoes statements in past speeches promising to rein in a boundless war on terror, including a Momina Bibi continue to be seen as nothing more than collateral damage, and terrorists without being given a day in court. Perhaps even more disturbing than a constitutional scholar acting so flagrantly despite criticism from the intelligence officials within the administration, is the hands-off policy of Congress. The legislative body has been full of complaints about Obama's foreign policy on both sides of the aisle, but they've never collectively organized to try and put a stop to it. This is often blamed on partisan disagreement, but since no one wants to be seen as \"soft on terror,\" the consensus has been to shirk responsibility and let the president take the blame. Yes, Obama is the commander-in-chief, but the power to declare war lies with Congress (something they haven't officially done since WWII). Apparently checks and balances only matter when it's convenient. The current \"debate\" over the president's new AUMF proposal puts the farce on display. Republican opposition has centered around absurdist concerns that it's too limiting, and that the game plan of how to defeat ISIS either isn't clear enough, or tells the enemy too much. Senator <mark>Ron Johnson</mark> told the National Journal, \"I need to find out exactly what President Obama is trying to achieve...I know he says\" degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS .' I'm not sure what he means by that. I don't think his definition of destroy and defeat is the same as mine. \"While Senator Orrin Hatch told KSL radio,\" If we advertise when the authorization expires with the arbitrary date and time, won't they just hunker down and wait for that date? \"As if ISIS will pause for a few years until America gives up. The real outrage is that Republican shock at executive overreach on health care are absent in the realm of war. Democrats meanwhile have shared their fears about a lack of constraints, but few have said they won't vote for the new proposal. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi toed a careful line with a painfully bland,\" We hope to have bipartisan support for something that would limit the power of the president but nonetheless protect the American people. \"Rep. Adam Schiff, who in January said,\" It's I think quite carte blanche in terms of geography, types of forces, etc.. And therefore, I think we're going to have to have a lot of work on that. \"That's a work in progress, not a rejection. Despite a recent and faint uptick in concern over perpetual conflict, AUMF repeal efforts have been blocked numerous times over the last 14 years and are just one reminder that Democrats have become a party that endorses aggression.

I call it a \"phony scandal\" because while there have been a few liberals (notably Howard Dean) to cite it as a disqualifier for the presidency, there have been far more conservatives raising lusty cries of Palinesque defiance of the godless lefty elites who think brainwashing at godless liberal universities is blah blah blah bark bark woof woof. Glenn Reynolds (a university professor, of course) USA Today: [A] President <mark>Walker</mark> would accomplish something worthwhile the moment he took office. Over the past few years in America, a college degree has become something valued more as a class signifier than as a source of useful knowledge. When Democratic spokesman Howard Dean (who himself was born into wealth) suggested that <mark>Walker</mark>'s lack of a degree made him unsuitable for the White House, what he really meant was that <mark>Walker</mark> is \"not our kind, dear\" - lacking the credential that many elite Americans today regard as essential to respectable status.... [T] he college degree - especially a degree from an elite school - has become an entry-level ticket into the educated mandarinate. In his important book, The New Class Conflict, Joel Kotkin calls it the \"clerisy\" - that now dominates government, journalism and academia. And as a result, an America that once prided itself on real-world achievement and practical good sense now runs largely on credentials. Kotkin, of course, is a conservative intellectual beating a conservative anti-intellectual drum that's not \"new\" at all; it goes back for many decades, not just in pointy-headed conservative circles but among politicians, particularly in the 1960s when \"university\" was identified with \"spoiled hippies\" on the Right. It's a shame for people like Reynolds and Kotkin that Spiro T. Agnew was forced to resign the vice presidency in disgrace; nobody will ever surpass his denunciation of liberals as \"an effete corps of impudent snobs .\" In any event, I guess progressives will have to dutifully line up and confirm that no, we do not consider a college degree a requirement for the presidency. Like an awful lot of things, educational credentials are a data point, and to that extent, conservatives touting <mark>Walker</mark> should admit not finishing college (after all, if elected <mark>Walker</mark> would be the first president born after 1884 to have no college degree) isn't some sort of positive accomplishment. If it was, then maybe Republicans should find a candidate who didn't finish high school, or who is illiterate; they'd sure be immune from all that Marxist propaganda, wouldn't they?", "articleID": "2015021616_00053831_W", "names": {"Scott Walker": ["Q13502385", "Q2035840", "Q20712628", "Q28835721", "Q48799183", "Q488603", "Q553254", "Q55362601", "Q7437461"]}}, {"date": "2015-02-19", "url": "http://citizensvoice.com/news/arguments-planned-in-lawsuit-targeting-school-funding-inequities-1.1835150", "content": "HARRISBURG - A state appeals court will hear arguments next month concerning a lawsuit calling for an end to sharp inequities in the way Pennsylvania public schools are funded. The full Commonwealth Court scheduled a March 11 hearing in Harrisburg to decide if the case can go forward, said Brett Schaeffer, policy analyst for the Education Law Center, an advocacy group. Wilkes-Barre Area School District, Shenandoah Valley School District in Schuylkill County and Panther Valley District in Carbon County are among several school district plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs include Tracey Hughes on behalf of her unnamed minor son, an eighth grader at E.L. Meyers Junior-Senior High School in Wilkes-Barre. The lawsuit seeks court action to erase disparities in per-pupil spending between richer and poorer school districts across Pennsylvania. Often reflecting variations in property values, education spending ranges from a low of $9,800 per pupil to a peak of $28,400 per pupil, said the Education Law Center and Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia. These groups, school districts and parents filed the lawsuit last November saying the Legislature and governor have failed to uphold a state constitutional obligation to provide public education that gives all children the resources they need to meet state-imposed academic standards. The lawsuit was filed following former Gov. Tom Corbett's re-election defeat. Attorneys for Corbett and the House and Senate filed motions on Jan. 16 seeking to dismiss the case. It is uncertain what legal course Gov. <mark>Tom Wolf</mark> will take, advocates said. <mark>Wolf</mark> spoke in broad terms about wanting to bridge the education spending gap in his Jan. 20 inaugural speech. \"Our state will never be as strong as it needs to be if some schools have all the resources they need and other schools are cutting band and football to just to keep the lights on,\" he said.
