Print 25.05.2017 08:45 AM Foreign steel producers on Wednesday called for prudence from the Trump administration as it considers possible actions to shield domestic companies from unfair imports on national security grounds. The remarks came at a public hearing that is part of a Commerce Department investigation into the effects of steel imports on US national security. The administration is also scrutinizing aluminum imports. The Trump administration's new stance has cheered US producers, who hope it will bring more relief to struggling industries than scores of scattershot anti-dumping cases. Domestic producers on Wednesday said unfair competition is undermining the US industrial base in ways that could jeopardize energy production and the manufacture of weapons, armor and vehicles. Still, some analysts say technological advances and increased productivity, more than trade, have accounted for much of the industry's job losses. John Ferriola, president of Nucor Corp, said his company's steel helped produce US Humvee light military trucks, Abrams battle tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, the Patriot surface-to-air missile system and the plating used for armored vehicles, Navy aircraft carriers and destroyers. That required \"continual investment\" in expertise, research, development and testing to meet exacting US Navy standards, he told the hearing. \"Unfortunately, global overcapacity and unfairly traded imports threaten our ability to invest,\" he said. \"Production overcapacity in the steel industry has reached crisis levels .\" - Trade barriers questioned - However, foreign producers told the hearing that new trade barriers could be both unnecessary and counter-productive. Karl Tachelet, head of international affairs at Eurofer--an association of European Union steel producers--said his organization had also been fighting unfair practices and global oversupply. \"We do not believe that restrictive, unilateral action based on national security will allow for lasting solutions we all need,\" he said, calling for the investigation to focus on \"specific uses\" directly tied to national security. \"What do tin mill products used to make cans for food and beverages have to do with national security?\" he said. \"How real is the risk that one day the US will not be able to produce enough rebar or sections for construction and infrastructure given its massive scrap availability?\" - China, Russia, Ukraine - <mark>Yu Gu</mark>, a representative of the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said the US Defense Department had found that US defense needs for steel were low, citing research that concluded that just three percent of domestic shipments served national defense purposes. \"Clearly, current and projected US national defense demand for steel can be readily satisfied by domestic production,\" he said. The deputy head of Russia's US trade mission, Alexander Zhmykhov, said his country's steel exports were already subject to heavy anti-dumping restrictions and duties in the United States, where certain imports have tumbled. \"Russian imports have already been so drastically limited by the measures enforced that further limitations would be excessive,\" he said. Ukraine's representative said his country's steel industry is under attack--suffering seizure and expropriation by foreign-backed separatists in industrial eastern Ukraine--but that security cooperation with the United States is also crucial to his country's stability. A 2001 investigation showed that the America was not vulnerable to imports of iron ore and semi-finished steel, said Vitalii Tarasiuk, minister-counsellor at the Ukrainian embassy. \"We are confident that evidence in this case will likewise show that steel imports do not threaten US national security,\" he said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday during a visit to Washington--where she met with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer--German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said she is worried the US steel investigation could result in higher tariffs on German exports of the metal and hopes to address the issue with US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

I got to know some very talented folks who touched my heart, and I expect that time spent listening to them will help them be successful in the future, \"said Kristen Cline, homeless program clinical supervisor for the Yolo County Department of Health & Human Services. Beginning at the Stephens Branch Library in Davis and moving to the West Sacramento Branch Library last year, the program recently concluded at the Fourth & Hope homeless shelter in Woodland .\" The clients have shared with me the excitement and joy the art class has brought to them over these weeks, and some of them will have their art in the show--it was a great opportunity to reach out to the community and share a fun activity, \"said Charlotte Baur, Fourth & Hope lead case manager. The artwork in the show includes pastel drawings, prints, 3-D work, masks, watercolor and painting. Teaching artists Melissa Uroff, Mary Anne Kirsch, <mark>Andrea Ross</mark> and Jim Vetter are expected to attend the reception along with those who created the artwork.

On Thursday, US-New Zealand aerospace company Rocket Lab successfully sent its Electron rocket into space from the remote Mahia Peninsula, between Napier and Gisborne. The rocket reached space and, although it did not quite make it into orbit, that puts New Zealand in the company of an elite group of countries, Rocket Lab chief executive and founder <mark>Peter Beck</mark> told Newshub. \"It's not every day that a country goes to space, I think New Zealand is the 11th nation now to do that, and, if you look at the other nations, they are generally super powers,\" he said on Friday. \"It's a great milestone for the country .\" The rocket reached space but it did not reach orbit, which requires significantly more energy as the launch vehicle must accelerate to about 27 times the speed of sound. \"All the really critical and key stages to go to orbit we achieved,\" Mr <mark>Beck</mark> said. \"We didn't quite get there but we'll find out exactly why but if you've seen any of the footage, New Zealand looks great from space .\" He said the launch also achieved a number of world firsts. \"It was the first all 3D printed rocket engine, first all carbon composite launch vehicle, first electric turbo pump - there was a lot of boxes ticked yesterday .\" Rocket Lab could now confidently push ahead with its next test flights and into commercial operations, Mr <mark>Beck</mark> said. He said the company aimed to send small satellites into orbit because satellites, like other forms of technology, were becoming smaller and did not require large expensive rockets to launch them. \"[There is an] absolute dire need for a small launch vehicle to get small satellites on orbit,\" Mr <mark>Beck</mark> said.

Klein started at MLB | Mike Triplett Some other lineup/attendance notables during Saints OTA practice Thursday: A.J. Klein started at MLB (though Manti Te'o still rehabbing). Newly-signed vet Josh LeRibeus at center in place of injured Max Unger. Senio Kelemete and Bryce Harris split time at LT while Terron Armstead watched from the side. P.J. <mark>Williams</mark> started at CB opposite Delvin Breaux. Rookie S <mark>Marcus Williams</mark> spent time with first string in three-safety alignment. DE Hau'oli Kikaha did some individual work as he rehabs from ACL. WR Willie Snead was present but did not participate. DT Nick Fairley did not appear to be in attendance. Undrafted former Georgia Tech QB <mark>Justin Thomas</mark> lined up as a WR. Veteran Josh LeRibeus getting a look at center for Saints this summer with Max Unger out | theadvocate.com \"It was really just the ballhandling, just learning how to snap,\" LeRibeus said. \"Because at guard, you just block the guy, so now you have a little extra aspect, but my whole thing is repetition .\" LeRibeus spent the entire 2016 season as a free agent, but with Unger's injury--the Saints' starter is expected back near the end of the preseason--there's an opening this summer to potentially fight for a roster spot. Veteran Tim Lelito, who backed up Unger last year, left for Tennessee in free agency, and Kelemete is the offensive line's sixth man. Marshon Lattimore is trying to circumvent what can be a hard learning curve for rookie cornerbacks | theadvocate.com So, it shouldn't be a surprise that first-round pick Marshon Lattimore didn't have a perfect showing during his debut practice before the media. He was never targeted during Thursday's organized team activity and appeared to be in phase on each route he defended, but there were other moments when he looked like a rookie trying to figure things out. One of those moments came late in the session when he failed to pick up his receiver coming out of the huddle, and the play had to be restarted. Lattimore was affixed to the right side of the field, and by the time he saw his guy lining up to the left and made his way over it was too late. \"My confidence level is at an all-time high,\" Breaux said Thursday after Saints organized team activities. \"I've worked my behind off this offseason just to know that it's time to be that Pro Bowl or All-Pro type guy .\" I just been working, man, and feel great. \"Can Okafor Give the Saints Pass Rush an Edge? \u2022 Saints News Network Okafor can play standing up or with his\" hand in the dirt \", and it's probably likely that the Saints will make him the new\" official' starter at that spot right out the gate; although he'll more than likely fill a situational role as part of a 3-man rotation and no doubt will have to show everyone that he can avoid the nagging injuries that constantly plagued him with the Cardinals. For Saints fans however, the addition of Okafor is looked at in a bit more simpler terms, which is: Can Okafor be the \"complementary\" player on the opposite side of All-Pro defensive end Cam Jordan that the team has lacked since the departure of former defensive end Junior Galette; and give their pass rush \"an edge\" that it has been sorely lacking for the past few seasons? <mark>Adrian Peterson</mark> working on pass-catching skills, and other Saints OTA observations | NOLA.com The Saints played primarily nickel defense throughout the practice. It looked like the familiar 4-2-5 defense we watched most of last season. Alex Okafor, predictably, manned the defensive end spot opposite Cam Jordan. Sheldon Rankins and David Onyemata took snaps with the first unit with Nick Fairley and Tyeler Davison not practicing.
