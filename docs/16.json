cruciate ligament injury during the game against carlisle, came on as a second half substitute against peterborough on tuesday night and went within a whisker of grabbing an injury-time leveller. orient's relegation worries worsened following the 3-2 defeat at the hands of the promotion-chasers, but gray is convinced the side can stay up. the striker hopes to keep his place in the squad for saturday's massive relegation showdown with brighton & hove albion in a must-win match for <mark>geraint williams</mark>' side. gray said after tuesday's match: \"every game is a massive one for us now and we need to get back to winning ways after a bit of a sticky patch .\" but we won two games on the bounce recently and we have got to go on a similar run. \"we have only won three at home all season, which is a problem but, hopefully, we can turn it around on saturday. the players have not given up by any stretch of the imagination and there are still 12 games to go and plenty of points to play for .\" we have got to try and take our second-half performance against peterborough into saturday's game and i believe we have enough ability in the dressing room to get out of trouble. \"after spending most of the season on the treatment table, gray was delighted to make a return on tuesday night .\" it was nice to be out there, i just hope i can make a difference and with four strikers and adam boyd coming back from injury, there is real competition for places, \"he added. gray could have marked his return with a sensational late leveller after sean thornton's free-kick bounced off visiting keeper <mark>joe lewis</mark>.\" as a striker you're always told to hit the target and that's what i did. but the keeper made a great save, although i expected to score, but next time i'll put it away. i feel good and very strong and want to keep playing, \"added gray.", "articleID": "2009030514_00051399_W", "names": {"Geraint Williams": ["Q4575731", "Q51123722"], "Joe Lewis":

we're not just going to the semi-final now, we want to actually win the trophy and that's been our aim right from the word go - we want to go all the way. \"everton manager moyes revealed there had been harsh words in the home dressing-room during the break .\" after a talking to at half-time by the staff members, the players showed what they were really about in the second half with the two goals, \"he said .\" (what was said) certainly couldn't be talked about here. we just needed them livened up. \"premier league table compared to everton's sixth place now just have a grim battle for top-flight survival to look forward to in the closing weeks of the season .\" that's all we have left to focus on, \"said boro manager .\" we've seen today why we are where we are, because we can't see matches through when we're ahead. \"we knew we'd have a bombardment second half and we feel we've got the players to deal with it - in actual fact for that five-minute spell we didn't,\" the former england central defender added. \"that sums us up this season so far .\" everton had been strong favourites to beat boro and book their first since 1995 - the year they last won the cup - but their first-half performance highlighted the nerves and tension within manager moyes's squad. middlesbrough since the opening day of the season - southgate's team had twice gone close through french forward jeremie aliadiere. everton, without a recognised striker in their starting line-up, lacked pace and penetration up-front with once again deployed as a makeshift lone forward. the home side's goal threat was limited to headers from belgian midfielder fellaini who, despite his height, failed to take advantage, although he did have one effort cleared off the line by. everton were punished for their poor first-half, though, when wheater beat goalkeeper <mark>tim howard</mark> with a close-range header seconds before the interval. a failure to clear a free-kick properly allowed bates to cross for the boro centre-half, who outjumped the everton defence. moyes made a key change at the interval, however, by introducing saha in place of young midfielder and the switch instantly upped everton's attacking threat. and the everton boss was rewarded for his positive change five minutes into the second-half when fellaini equalised with a header from cahill's cross. fellaini's goal put everton firmly in control of the game and they proceeded to pour forward in an attempt to capitalise on their second-half dominance. sports video: fantasy mlb: fantasy downgrades royals notebook:

licensed all-ages venue connected to the old econolodge and the jekyll and hyde. instead of incurring the irritatingly high costs of replacing said glass, the venue's superheroic promoter cecil frena decided to fix this problem through a different kind of transparency. after receiving numerous offers from local musicians, a fundraiser was developed and the result was more than enough income to get a new window as well as subsidize the cost of the quarterly edmonton music cd newsletter that frena ships to college radio for our benefit. but i figured as much. i suppose it's a good thing that i'm a psychic. clairvoyant, voodoo man, gyspy, whatever you want to call me, i was ahead of three developments during this sunday night marathon. enduring a rotating gallery of guitar acts, i was a little disappointed by the singularity of edmonton's burgeoning talent. my brief generation of synth-tempered acts has been replaced by a lo-fi personal dynamic, a rockist reaction to the commercialization and oversaturation of electro-house in recent years. it seems that approaching a genuine synth aesthetic based on european traditions and abstract melodicism would somehow betray the workmanlike dirt city rock ethos. that isn't to say the music that was played wasn't worthwhile. taking in an eamon mcgrath set at 5:30 pm may seem beside the point, but it was an interesting view on a passionate performer. known for his hedonism and devil-may-care attitude, seeing mcgrath rock out on an empty floor for a seated audience where he was playing (possibly) without alcohol while nursing a tender voice was a special moment of revelation. as blurry as his rep is, you have to consider his focus on stage as undeniable. there's a certain mystique about him that instantly creates interest, regardless of his reputation. the fact that he was playing this event reminded me of sean nicholas savage's brilliant anthem in his name, \"eamon,\" a song that lampoons his (alleged) drug-addled stage frenzy (\"doin' shows on ecstasy!\" ) and maudlin lyricism (\"he's so unhappy!\" ). after i spent much of the night singing that song's praises, sans aides (nee peter sagar) randomly brought his posse on stage for a completely unrelated chorus line take on that local favourite. maybe that one was pretty obvious. but during sagar's creative set incorporating live looping of drums and atmospheric guitar textures, i remarked on a similarity to the approach of animal collective...immediately before he launched into a cover of \"ponytail\" by ac member panda bear. perceptive? sure. psychic? possibly. after a hilarious romp through christmas traditions and drunk-dialing etiquette from the multi-talented doug hoyer and an emotionally stirring performance from jim cuming, we were treated to a rollicking blues set from michael rault. beyond the obvious retro touchstones and \"old soul\" rhapsodizing people typically afford him, rault actually reminded me a lot of <mark>michael jackson</mark>. r & b roots, methodical, measured delivery, complete control of tone and pitch and a knack for melodies that only seem to sound good with his voice, he fits an atypical profile in my head. it also doesn't hurt that he's a complete natural on stage. the first song played after his set was \"black and white\" by <mark>michael jackson</mark>. i thought this was really weird. i guess as long as he doesn't dye his skin black and get a taste for faberge eggs, he should be safe.", "articleID": "2009031123_00002657_W", "names": {"Michael Jackson": ["Q2831", "Q3308266", "Q3856193",

investor's business daily posted 3/11/2009 americans seem to be climbing back in their cars even as the economy continues to go in reverse. four-week u.s. gasoline demand climbed for five weeks before dipping in the week ended march 6, the energy information administration said wednesday. implied demand - gasoline \"disappeared\" from refineries and distributors for delivery to gas stations and other outlets - fell just 0.7% vs. a year earlier after plunging 4.8% in early october. \"prices have declined dramatically since july and maybe some of the restraints people had on their driving have relaxed,\" said american petroleum institute economist ron planting. that in turn has pushed retail gasoline prices up 20% so far this year to $1.938 a gallon. that's still well below the summer peak above $4. api's gasoline demand gauge rose 1.7% in january vs. a year earlier, the first gain in 12 months. planting said preliminary results suggest another rise in february. gasoline inventories have trended lower, another clue to demand, after building for seven straight weeks through mid-january. they fell 3 million barrels last week to their lowest level since the start of the year, eia said. the lower supplies also reflect refiners doing a better job of curbing their output to match market demand. the combined changes have caught the attention of industry watchers. but most still don't expect a genuine strengthening in demand until the second half of the year. and there is broad agreement that the numbers should be interpreted with a strong dose of salt. \"i'm suspect of the data,\" said larry goldstein, director of the energy policy research foundation. \"it's too early to be looking at a structural, fundamental increase in consumption .\" <mark>john cook</mark>, director of the eia's petroleum division, points out that the weekly numbers can fluctuate wildly, and tend to be revised significantly lower over time, primarily due to exports data. <mark>cook</mark> emphasizes that the numbers do not show direct demand increase per se. but he contends the weekly data gauges trends just as accurately as do monthly data. he says the recent improvement in demand is significant. \"the four week averages are telling us something,\" <mark>cook</mark> said. \"folks are back on the road .\" at the same time, oil prices have steadied at above $40 a barrel after a dip below $34 in february. opec has slashed official output quotas by 4.2 million barrels per day since september. other producers have curbed activity due to lower prices. opec has struggled to coerce cash-starved members to actually cut back to meet their quotas. crude prices started to make a move on $50 earlier this week. but they fell $3.38 to $42.33 on wednesday after eia data showed u.s. crude supplies unexpectedly rose 749,000 barrels. also, china reported declining oil imports. opec ministers meet sunday in vienna. analysts debate whether they'll cut quotas again. but forecasters continue cutting their demand outlooks. the eia said tuesday that global oil use will fall by 1.4 million barrels per day this year. bp ceo tony hayward told investors in london last week that he didn't expect opec's production cuts to cut into inventories until the second half of 2009. fuels specialist robert starkey of houston-based <mark>jim jordan</mark> & associates says

last year. oliver wandered out of the centre's screen door, onto a paved car park and left into an adjacent reserve. if instead he had strayed just 15 metres to the right, he would have stepped onto busy gilmore avenue. at the time, oliver's parents were appalled that the centre, one in a chain of 20 operated by child care industry identity rory vassallo, took until january 5 to report the incident. even though regulations allow for a charge to be laid and a $15,000 fine imposed for allowing a child to go missing, reporting of such incidents is not compulsory. now, two months after oliver's unsupervised walkabout, ms mcsweeney said the legal advice was in, and work on closing the loophole had commenced. \"the department of communities have sought advice from legal counsel regarding the tightening of legislation and are currently working through how proposed changes may affect current regulations,\" she said. a strikingly similar case to oliver's, where another
