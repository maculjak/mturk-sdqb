campbell</mark>. photo reprints <mark>matt campbell</mark> theorizes that the biggest strides made by a college football team happen now, between the first and second weeks, because players should be accustomed to the speed and the emotion of a game. the area on defense in which the university of toledo coach hopes to see the most growth following the season-opener at arizona is no surprise to anyone who watched the rockets grasp at air all night. in reviewing the film, <mark>campbell</mark> counted anywhere from 180 to 200 yards surrendered after his defense missed a tackle. that's a big ole chunk of the 624 yards accrued by the wildcats in their 24-17 overtime win. \"it's one of the things we stress more than anything,\" <mark>campbell</mark> said monday. <mark>campbell</mark> was actually pleased with most areas of the unit. he praised his young cornerbacks for covering well and conceding small and medium chunks of yards rather than debilitating receptions. he applauded the two turnovers created, and the bend-but-don \"t-break attitude that led to a reasonable number of points allowed relative to the enormous number of yards given up. he said his players executed the game plan. but tackling, well, that area better tighten up before saturday at wyoming. safeties were the main culprit, said <mark>campbell</mark>, whose assertion was echoed by one of them. senior jermaine robinson, one of the most reliable members of the unit and a team captain, whiffed a number of times. his failure to bring down running back ka\" deem carey in the open field led to a 73-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter. \"i put that on myself to work harder this week and to eliminate those few missed tackles,\" robinson said. \"those tackles could have changed the game .\" toledo does not keep a record for yards allowed, but arizona's 623 are the most in a while. wyoming totaled 345 yards in a 37-17 loss saturday at no. 15 texas. quarterback <mark>brett smith</mark>, the reigning freshman of the year in the mountain west conference, threw for 276 yards, with 173 of them and both of his touchdown passes going to 5-foot-10 junior robert herron. the cowboys, who won eight games in 2011 and lost to temple in the new mexico bowl, beat toledo two years ago at the glass bowl. \"it's all going to come back to keep the ball in front of us, tackling, and playing sound defense,\" robinson said. hayes coming: <mark>campbell</mark> confirmed a report from the blade stating former whitmer standout and ohio state defensive lineman kenny hayes is enrolled at toledo and plans to play football. toledo is awaiting the go-ahead from the ncaa clearinghouse before officially welcoming hayes, a former four-star recruit whom rivals considered the nation's 68th best prospect in 2010. hayes (6-5, 285 pounds) must sit out this season before becoming eligible next fall. he will have three years of eligibility remaining. hayes redshirted as a freshman last season with the buckeyes following an all-state senior season at whitmer. he left the team last month. \"he's a gifted football player and certainly had a great high school career,\" <mark>campbell</mark> said. \"at the end of the day, it will all be predicated on kenny and what his adjustment is coming to the university of toledo and fitting into our football team .\" short yards: <mark>campbell</mark> said quarterback terrance owens will start saturday \"if all things are equal\" during the week between he and austin dantin. owens did not win the right to start the arizona game last week, but will get the nod because it is his turn after dantin won a coin flip to start at arizona. dantin is expected to enter the game early, just as owens did in the third series saturday ....punter vince penza was

despite initiatives aimed at improving services for those with the condition, according to a new report. a survey of services for the estimated 250,000 people in the uk with me - myalgic encephalomyelitis - or cfs - has shown more than a quarter of primary care trusts (pcts) do not commission specialist secondary care for people with the condition. less than a quarter of the trusts said they provided home visits for me patients who are too disabled to travel. the statistics were compiled by the charity action for me using freedom of information requests to 151 pcts in england, 14 health boards in scotland, seven health boards in wales and five local commissioning groups in northern ireland. the findings were compiled from responses or part responses received from 143 pcts, 11 scottish health boards, six welsh health boards and three health and social care boards in northern ireland, the charity said. it added that it had reported six pcts and one scottish health board to the information commissioner over their failure to respond at all to the questionnaire. only 37 pcts, along with one scottish, one welsh and one northern irish board, said they provided home visits for people with the condition. the charity described the situation in england as \"profoundly depressing\" given a series of initiatives and repeated assurances from ministers in successive governments that the needs of me patients would be addressed by local care commissioners. in scotland and wales statements of good intent have been made by each of the governments but so far there has been no evidence of implementing any significant initiative to provide \"appropriate\" secondary care for patients, the report said. the study added that progress in northern ireland \"lags well behind\" and the nhs has not yet \"even grasped the scale or the seriousness\" of the impact of me on patients and their families. action for me chief executive, sir <mark>peter spencer</mark>, said: \"these figures are a disgraceful indictment of institutionalised discrimination and neglect. health services in all of the four home nations are still not even beginning to address the needs of this vulnerable patient group properly. rhetoric and prevarication from ministers is simply not good enough. we need action now to put this right once and for all .\" temperature: 9 c to 17 c wind speed:

castle-loving stoner kumar (played by kal penn) smoked marijuana with a fictional george w. bush. in real life, the 35-year-old actor served as associate director of the white house office of public engagement under president barack obama for two years. \"my favorite job was working for a boss who gave the order to take out bin laden,\" he said at tuesday night's democratic national convention in charlotte, north carolina. \"so thank you, invisible man in the chair, for that .\" the \"invisible man\" penn referred to is pres. obama, who was \"interviewed\" by veteran actor <mark>clint eastwood</mark> at last week's republican national convention. the 82-year-old actor talked to an empty chair as if obama were sitting there, inadvertently starting a internet meme called \"eastwooding .\" according to the new york daily news, penn's speech at the 2012 dnc was aimed to help the obama campaign with reaching younger voters, asking them to register to vote online: \"you don't even have to put pants on!\" penn also told viewers to tweet about his speech using the hashtag #sexyface, and the word instantly became a trending topic on twitter. the hill notes that he and his \"harold and kumar\" co-star <mark>john cho</mark> also appear in a youtube video promoting \"live from charlotte,\" a online program for the dnc to be hosted by penn on thursday night before the president's speech. the convention special will feature celebrities like <mark>marc anthony</mark>, <mark>elizabeth banks</mark>, aisha tyler and olivia wilde. in the 53-second spot, pres. obama is seen calling penn and asking him to take the job seriously as the two actors laugh and munch on junk food in front of the television. other hollywood stars have already appeared at the dnc in charlotte, too. \"glee\" actress amber riley sang the national anthem tuesday night, and celebrities spotted in the audience included \"wings\" actor <mark>tim daly</mark>, patricia arquette, wayne knight, alfre woodard, \"monk\" star tony shalhoub and john leguizamo. according to the guardian, even bigger names will be in town when pres. obama speaks thursday night. <mark>james taylor</mark>,

much attention as <mark>eastwood</mark> at the rnc? perhaps \"off their rockers\" star betty white could do it. as of tuesday evening, more than 12,000 hopefuls have signed a petition and another 35,000 fans joined a facebook group to bring white to the democratic national convention. a similar online campaign in 2010 earned enough support to make the 90-year-old actress guest host for an episode of \"saturday night live .\" cbs reports white endorsed pres. obama for re-election in may, saying she liked \"how he represents us .\" he filmed a birthday greeting for the former \"golden girls\" star earlier this year as well, joking that she didn't believe her age and asked to see a copy of her birth certificate. both obama and vice president joe biden are scheduled to speak at the
