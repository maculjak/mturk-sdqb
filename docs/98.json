(the law) blows me away .\" the two albany-area residents are among thousands of oregonians aligning behind legislation that will expand a dairy's ability to supply raw cow's milk. house bill 2222 is sponsored by a diverse group of lawmakers, including a physician, sen. <mark>alan bates</mark>, d-ashland, and several conservative republicans. the mainstream oregon dairy industry opposes hb2222. \"the main issue is there is no way you can guarantee the safety of consumers from raw milk,\" said roger beyer, a lobbyist for the oregon dairy farmers association. \"and what happens is if anyone gets sick from a milk product, consumers don't look at it as raw versus pasteurized. it's milk. and there would be impact to the whole industry from that .\" in addition to concerns over human safety, dairy farmers wonder who is going to pay the costs of licensing raw milk dairies. the oregon department of agriculture estimates the annual cost of licensing raw milk producers at $10,000 per dairy. \"that's if you don't have any screened positives, and life is beautiful,\" said jim postlewait, food program manager with the department. testing for pathogens in raw milk is far more expensive than standard dairy tests, which look for drugs and somatic cell counts. oregon dairies currently pay between $135 and $812 a year for state inspections, with larger dairies paying more. \"we want to know who will pay for that (additional) cost,\" beyer said. while raw milk has advocates, it also has detractors. oregon senior epidemiologist bill keene said disease outbreaks from consumers drinking raw milk \"are a staple\" in epidemiology circles. \"people who drink raw milk are at very high risk for getting infections, relative to people who drink pasteurized milk,\" he said. \"if more people drink raw milk, more people will get sick from raw milk. that's a truism .\" when asked if he would drink raw milk, he said: \"not knowingly .\" when asked if he would recommend his family drink raw milk, he said: \"i would be horrified to hear about it .\" it is such an unnecessary risk when pasteurization is cheap and a highly effective public health intervention, \"keene said. to date, 13 states, including washington and idaho, allow raw cow's milk sales in stores and 29 allow raw cow's milk sales of some sort. oregon started restricting raw cow's milk sales in 1999. kapple sells the 6 to 9 gallons of milk that her cow produces each day to 15 customers, who drive to the midway farms produce stand and pick up the pre-ordered milk. other residents have asked if they could buy the milk, but kapple is unable to supply them.", "articleID": "2011020612_00165669_W", "names": {"Alan Bates": ["Q4706144", "Q4706145"]}}, {"date": "2011-02-10", "url": "http://Health-Information.advanceweb.com/Features/Articles/Leadership-vs-Power.aspx", "content": "king george iii asked benjamin west, his american painter, what george washington would do if he prevailed in the revolutionary war. west replied, \"he will return to his farm .\" the british monarch incredulously said, \"if he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world .\" on dec. 23, 1783, washington did just that and retired to mount vernon - despite the encouragement of many to stay in power. despite the willingness of americans to crown him king. in 1787, washington was coaxed back to philadelphia to attend the constitutional convention. while there he provided the leadership necessary to get the fractious delegates to settle down and complete the work of designing a new constitution. afterwards, in 1789, he was elected the first president of the united states. he reluctantly ran for a second term in 1792. he refused to run for a third term, setting a precedent that lasted 150 years, and retired once again to his farm. abraham lincoln said, \"if you want to test a man's character - give him power .\" george washington passed that test. twice in his life he walked away from power and proved that he was indeed the greatest man in the world. he demonstrated that leadership is something that you give - not take - and that power should be used responsibly. washington died in 1799, the year that napoleon bonaparte became the ruler of france. in contrast to washington, napoleon could not acquire enough power. his legendary lust for command drove him to take over much of europe. \"power is my mistress,\" he once claimed. \"i have worked too hard at her conquest to allow anyone to take her away from me .\" history is rife with stories of people who abused their power. abuse of power, however, is not just reserved for politicians and tyrants. it can be abused by managers, spouses, parents, peers and the list goes on. it is the lure of dominance over others, when it motivates people toward leadership roles, that is revealing. it reveals uncertainty, lack of confidence and fear. it is said that power corrupts, but more often than not, it is a corrupted individual who is attracted to power. it is a feeling of inferiority, sometimes called a napoleon complex, that drives someone to control other people and to micro-manage their surroundings. today we call such a person a \"control freak .\" science fiction author robert heinlein noted, \"anyone who wants to be a politician shouldn't be allowed to be one .\" when we look at abraham maslow's hierarchy of human motivation (survival, safety, social, esteem, fulfillment), we see that someone who hungers for power is stuck in the second to bottom level, which is safety. a true leader has self-esteem and self-confidence and does not seek power to bolster his or her feeling of self worth. <mark>thomas jefferson</mark> observed that, \"an honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over his fellow citizens .\" a true leader is motivated by a goal-a goal common to his group whether that group is a company or a country. if you find yourself attracted to leadership, stop and check your motivation. are you driven to share your gift of understanding in the endeavor of achieving a goal, or are you motivated by perquisites of position and the power you have over others? as john quincy adams said, \"if your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader .\" to prevent comment spam, please type the code you see below into the code field before submitting your comment. if you cannot read the numbers in the below image, reload the page to generate a new one.", "articleID": "2011021002_00048827_W", "names": {"Thomas Jefferson": ["Q6115426", "Q743755", "Q7791239"]}}, {"date": "2011-02-12", "url": "http://nandugreen.typepad.com/chasing_the_wind/2011/02/chinese-miners-on-cedar-creek-a-historical-legeacy-1.html", "content": "gold in quartz? february 12, 2011 tales of chinese miners on cedar creek - a historical legacy discovery why some of montana's history was written in chinese. superior - standing in the mountains of a western montana forest, chris merritt smiled as he held up fragments of a culture from halfway around the world. the newly discovered artifacts - opium tins, soup bones, ceramic bowls, calligraphy stones, a poker chip, a snake oil bottle - are from the first large 19th century chinese mining settlement in montana. merritt, an archaeologist, handled the artifacts lovingly - as though they were the gold nuggets that the immigrants never found in the watery recesses of the lolo national forest. a volunteer group chosen through passport in time, \"in archaeology, you don't need to find whole objects,\" he said. \"fragments are enough to piece together the story of history .\" the history of chinese immigrants in the american west is well-known - laboring in mines, railroads and laundries, facing hardship and prejudice - but the university of montana and the u.s. forest service are teaming up this summer for the first detailed archaeological excavation of early chinese gold mining settlements in the big sky state. merritt, a doctoral student at um, will explore six sites in six national forests across western montana. his work is being overseen by kelly dixon, an assistant professor of historical archaeology at um. chinese laborers helped build the american west in the 19th century, but anti-chinese laws, animosity and an economic downturn forced many to return to san francisco, seattle or china before the turn of the century. in montana, chinese immigrants made up 10 percent of the state's population in 1870, a figure that dropped to about 4 percent by 1890. \"the chinese had a huge impact on every corner of this state, but we have huge gaps in our knowledge about how they adapted to what montana could throw at them socially and environmentally,\" merritt said. \"we know they had a classic story of the old west, going to the places of least resistance\" to seek their fortune and avoid the most overt prejudice, he said. \"in this case, it was china gulch and louisville .\" merritt's dissertation project, which is funded by a $24,000 grant from the forest service, started last week in china gulch and louisville, an 1870s gold mining settlement near superior, where archaeologists have documented the only known remnants of the first large influx of chinese workers into montana. over the years, the six chinese settlements have been documented - as well as looted - and preliminary evaluations have been completed, but merritt's project will be the first comprehensive study of the sites. after gold was discovered in california in 1849, thousands of americans and foreign immigrants flocked to the western united states to seek their fortune. following rumors of gold, prospectors raced from place to place, staking claims and setting up mining camps along streams and mountainsides. white prospectors tended to work alone or in pairs, but chinese banded together in small groups in an effort to improve their chances. boomtowns sprung up overnight and often disappeared just as quickly. one such place was louisville, where two frenchmen found gold in cedar creek in december 1869. the men filed a claim and made a pact to keep the site a secret until they returned in the spring, but one of them drunkenly disclosed the discovery while visiting a missoula saloon. a gold rush ensued, drawing prospectors from around the region, including missoula where the population dropped from 2,500 to 500 as townsfolk headed north and west to cedar creek. by the spring of 1870, 1,100 people had set up camp on about two acres beside the creek, pitching tents and erecting log buildings in a settlement they named louisville - pronounced \"louise-ville\" after the wife of one of the french prospectors. but a few months later, all but about 100 of louisville's inhabitants had departed for other prospecting sites after having failed to find significant gold in cedar creek. at the same time, idaho's moose creek mining district passed a law prohibiting chinese from owning mining claims or property. so about 500 chinese prospectors came over the bitterroot mountains that summer and settled beside the nearly empty louisville, where they sought gold from an unnamed creek just upstream of cedar creek. their settlement became known as china gulch and the feeder creek as china creek. they put up tents, built rock cooking ovens and placered gold, but it was harsh terrain and they faced starvation. in 1871, after all but a few white prospectors had abandoned louisville, the chinese moved in and stayed until the late 1880s - when they departed after failing to strike it rich. mining companies reoccupied louisville in the 1890s and 1930s, using it as a base for industrial mining until the 1950s, when the settlement was abandoned for the last time. archaeology - and looting - have been around for as long as people have wanted to document and profit from human and natural history. in 1979, the federal archaeological resources protection act outlawed looting, but louisville had been picked over by then by mineral county residents and artifact hunters who took most of the intact items. china gulch was reclaimed by the thick, damp forest and largely forgotten. maps mistakenly located it half a mile away. in 1995, <mark>mary williams</mark>, a forest service historian, led an expedition that discovered the actual site of china gulch when they uncovered the remains of the rock ovens. they were the first such hearths identified in western montana. the forest service determined china gulch to be a significant find, but the agency lacked the money and work force for a complete excavation, said milo mcleod, archaeologist for the lolo national forest. \"we were excited, but we didn't know what we really had\" until 2007 when merritt did a more thorough examination of the site, mcleod said. \"we got such unique information that we wanted to do a full follow-up investigation .\" among the most important evidence uncovered are 2,000 fragments of animal bones that the chinese prospectors had boiled for marrow soup. the bones had been chopped and boiled repeatedly in a desperate attempt to fight off starvation. \"these are the kinds of things that tell the stories of the daily lives of these immigrants,\" merritt said. besides physical evidence, project officials also are using newspaper stories, claim records, maps and other materials to piece together the history of china gulch and louisville. another important source of information is area residents, who can relay stories their families have told for generations and who collected artifacts before it was illegal, merritt said. small amounts of gold are still present in china gulch and cedar creek, where prospectors still file mining claims. an estimated $6 million to $7 million in gold has been found in cedar creek since 1870, a relatively small amount in the history of western gold mining, merritt said. harsh mountain weather, collectors and bulldozers left little surface evidence of the early occupation of the two settlements - except for the rock ovens and a collapsed log building that might have been a saloon, hotel or general store. in the 1930s, the federal government inflated the price of gold in an effort to spur economic development during the depression. mining companies reopened louisville and pushed most of the original town into cedar creek. much of the new excavation is being conducted by the forest service's passport in time program, which uses volunteers on archaeological and historic preservation projects nationwide. merritt and mcleod are overseeing the work. working up a sweat in the mountain sunshine, the volunteers pulled away brush - to uncover some areas that looters might have missed - then marked off the sites and sifted down through the layers of dirt. \"i love it,\" said volunteer steve waylett, a retired navy flight officer from idaho. \"it's a chance to see history come alive .\" china gulch and louisville may be opened to the public and an interpretive sign and walking trail constructed after the excavation is completed by late summer. some of the artifacts are to be displayed at the mineral county historical society museum in superior. mike beckes, archaeologist for the forest service's northern region, said merritt, who is just starting his professional career, and mcleod, who is retiring soon after more than three decades in the field, have formed an effective partnership. \"we know there was a chinese presence here, but we don't know the fine detail - how these people lived, what they ate, their illnesses, where they got their supplies,\" beckes said. \"there's a lot more to tell .\" your comment could not be posted. error type: your comment has been saved. comments are moderated and will not appear until approved by the author. the letters and numbers you entered did not match the image. please try again.", "articleID": "2011021223_00011945_W", "names": {"Mary Williams": ["Q13562532", "Q18936209", "Q19867085", "Q47120706", "Q56598008"]}}, {"date": "2011-02-13", "url": "http://wcnc.com/news/world/116100454.html", "content": "register now! benefits: post comments manila, philippines (ap) -
