Simon Byrne was suspended as chief constable of Cheshire Constabulary last year after being accused of breaching standards of professional behaviour in respect of authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct. At a hearing at Warrington Town Hall on Tuesday, police and crime commissioner <mark>David Keane</mark> said the panel, led by Rachel Crasnow QC, had found no allegations of misconduct or gross misconduct were proved against Mr Byrne. No misconduct allegations against Simon Byrne were proved (Cheshire Constabulary/PA) The 55-year-old, whose contract with the force has expired since his suspension, said he was pleased to have been \"totally exonerated\" following the allegations he bullied and belittled staff after moving from the Met Police to take up the top role at the Cheshire force in 2014. In its report, the panel said: \"This misconduct panel has been an unfortunate experience for all concerned and our overriding conclusion is that it could--and should--have been avoided .\" We have reflected at length on the circumstances which led to such a time consuming (and costly) process being used to try and resolve what was essentially a clash of cultures, personalities and attitudes within Cheshire Constabulary following Mr Byrne's arrival. \"The panel, which found a number of the 74 allegations were exaggerated by witnesses, said guidance and mentoring for chief constables should be welcomed by police forces to prevent a similar situation. The misconduct hearing in July was told Mr Byrne had a reputation for being like Darth Vader and treated junior officers and staff like\" roadkill \". The panel heard he handed pictures of Dad's Army characters to officers after he became angry when flooding made him late for work. However in its report, it found the incident was an example of Mr Byrne's\" approach to leadership \"and it was wrong to attribute\" malevolent intent \"to it. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Byrne said:\" This whole affair has been an ordeal for all parties that has gone on too long and wasted precious public money scrutinising my conduct when leading what Mr <mark>Keane</mark> has described himself as a high performance force. \"He added:\" In some ways, it still feels like upside down justice as I have lost my vocation after 35 years of public service. \"I have today released the Independent Panel's report in the gross misconduct proceedings against former Chief Constable Simon Byrne.

He said:\" What's really important to me is that we followed a statutory, laid down procedure with the Police (Conduct) Regulations, that we have had an open, transparent hearing and that we have had accountability within policing. \"That's my job as police and crime commissioner, to ensure we have an open and transparent police service and that I ensure the police service is accountable to everybody it serves .\" Joanne Moorcroft, secretary of the Cheshire Police branch of Unison, said the branch was \"extremely disappointed\" by the outcome of the hearing. She said: \"A number of our members have shown immense courage and bravery to come forward with their concerns about the behaviour of Mr Byrne .\" Every one of them genuinely believed and still believes that they were the victim of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. \""}, {"articleID": "2018110619_00391034_W", "names": {"John Alexander": ["Q1281683", "Q15130097", "Q15485788", "Q17984377", "Q18637103", "Q23580725", "Q30314318", "Q30610836", "Q3180874", "Q3180876", "Q43126666", "Q43396031", "Q43913359", "Q6105197", "Q6218537", "Q6218545", "Q6218548"]}, "date": "2018-11-06", "url": "http://harrowtimes.co.uk/news/national/17205552.michelin-to-consider-scottish-government-proposals-to-prevent-plant-closure/", "content": "Michelin factory closure 0 comments Michelin has agreed to consider Scottish Government proposals that could save its closure-threatened Dundee tyre plant, MSPs have been told. Scottish Economy Secretary Derek Mackay said an action group, which he will chair, has been established to develop the proposition and it will meet in the city on Monday. Mr Mackay said: \"We're aware that this task is not easy one, and there are significant challenges to be faced .\" But we are, as a government, determined to do everything within our power, to prevent this closure. \"Economy Secretary Derek Mackay met workers at the plant on Tuesday (Andrew Milligan/PA) The developments emerged after the company announced that the tyre factory, which has 845 workers, will cease production within two years. Dundee City Council leader <mark>John Alexander</mark> has described the proposed shutdown as a\" body blow \"for all of the staff. A meeting was held on Tuesday at the plant, while production has been suspended until Thursday to allow employees to digest the news. Mr Mackay, who was in Dundee on Tuesday to meet representatives from Michelin, the Unite union and Dundee City Council, later returned to the Scottish Parliament to update MSPs on the situation. He said he met Michelin group executives on Sunday with Scottish Enterprise and\" they have agreed to consider a proposition we will bring forward to secure a sustainable future for the plant \". The Michelin plant will remain closed until Thursday morning (Andrew Milligan/PA) Mr Mackay told the chamber that\" good will \"between unions and Michelin was part of the reason Michelin is willing to listen to the proposition. He said:\" Michelin's announcement that it intends to close its plant in Dundee is devastating, not just for those who work at the plant but their families and the whole of the city of Dundee and the wider area. \"The Scottish Government will do all we can to secure a future for the plant and the workforce .\" Let me be clear--we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to keep this plant operation in Dundee. \"Our top priority is to pursue options for the site to continue with commercial production .\" Potential options include \"repurposing\" the factory to do other work for Michelin. The market for premium smaller tyres such as those produced at the Tayside factory has dropped significantly due to an increase in cheap imports from Asia and a shift to larger car tyres, according to the French firm. It says it is not economically viable to produce small, low-cost tyres at the Dundee site or switch to the production of larger tyres. The plant opened in 1972 is due to cease operations by mid-2020. Unite said it had been working on a \"flexibility agreement\" involving voluntary redundancies and changes to the shift patterns over the last two months to secure the factory's future. It said it was given no notice of Monday evening's announcement. Many workers said they found out via the news and social media. Marc Jackson, Unite Michelin convener, said: \"It is important to stress to the workforce and the wider community in Dundee that Unite has a viable plan on the table .\" The flexibility agreement, which we believed would be signed-off this week, takes into consideration the current challenging market conditions but we have a plan in place to manage this situation over the coming years. \"The workforce can be assured that Unite will work tirelessly to ensure that this flexibility agreement is reconsidered by the Michelin Group and that the factory can stay open .\" Marc Jackson, Unite Michelin convenor said: \"To stress to the workforce and the wider community in Dundee, Unite has a viable plan on the table. It is a plan that can work for the workforce and the company .\" pic.twitter.com/T8gAfiJ4kX--Unite Scotland (@ UniteScotland) November 6, 2018 Dundee East MSP Shona Robison said all options would be looked at. She said: \"It's not going to be easy but one thing that really comes through is just how strong the workforce is .\" Dundee is part of a \u00a3 350 million Tay Cities Deal aimed at boosting economic growth in the region through investment from both the Scottish and UK Governments. Mr Mackay has called on the UK Government to bring forward additional measures and investment in light of Michelin's announcement. Labour MSP Jenny Marra told the Scottish Parliament the proposed \u00a3 350 million for the Tay Cities deal \"will not now touch the sides, especially as investments will go to other parts of the region\". Michelin said it would provide a personalised support package for each worker, with the opportunity to train in new skills and the possibility of being redeployed within the company or elsewhere. It will begin a consultation with employees and trade unions on the closure plan over the next fortnight. 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2019060217_00201203_W", "names": {"John Roberts": ["Q11153", "Q14949621", "Q16196671", "Q19325651", "Q20895752", "Q21542199", "Q2913257", "Q320178", "Q41805076", "Q44155502", "Q47430963", "Q54610143", "Q56187938", "Q56253587", "Q56597924", "Q6255164", "Q6255170", "Q6255174", "Q6255177", "Q6255184", "Q6255195", "Q6255202"]}, "date": "2019-06-02", "url": "http://wboc.com/story/40578763/protest-in-hungary-over-govt-plan-to-seize-research-network", "content": "Protest in Hungary over govt plan to seize research network - WBOC-TV 16, Delmarvas News Leader, FOX 21 - Protest in Hungary over govt plan to seize research network - WBOC-TV 16, Delmarvas News Leader, FOX 21 - Member Center: Protest in Hungary over govt plan to seize research network Posted: Friday, May 31 2019 6:11 PM EDT 2019-05-31 22:11:21 GMT Updated: Sunday, June 2 2019 1:32 PM EDT 2019-06-02 17:32:42 GMT Scientists tasked with reviewing the government's plans to lift protections for gray wolves across most of the U.S. say the proposal has numerous factual errors and other problems.

The largest foreign parliamentary delegation landed in Poland from Israel on Monday, Jan. 27 - the day that the United Nations in 2005 designated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day - and consisted of 58 Knesset members. Constituting nearly half of the Israeli parliament, it is the largest Knesset delegation ever to have visited the Auschwitz compound, organizers said. Several Knesset members, including Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, attended a solemn prayer led by Israel's Chief Ashkenazi rabbi, David Lau, near the famous \"Arbeit macht frei\" (\"Work will make you free\" ) sign at the entrance to the Auschwitz camp. The U.S. delegation is headed by Rep. Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican and first Jewish majority leader of Congress. With Cantor are Reps. Darrell Issa (R-Calif .) and Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). They are scheduled to be joined by 23 lawmakers from 10 European Union member states who came with European Friends of Israel and the Israeli-Jewish Congress. In Krakow, the Knesset delegation is scheduled to hold a ceremonial inter-parliamentary session with the Polish parliament, the Sejm. \"When we say\" Never Again,' we can say it because there is a Jewish state and a Jewish army, \"the event's Israeli initiator, Johnny Daniels, told JTA on Monday .\" The presence of half the Israeli parliament in Auschwitz is a powerful symbol for that reason. \"Daniels, a 28-year-old Britton who immigrated to Israel 10 years ago, began producing the event six months ago as executive director of From the Depths, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to Holocaust education .\" Holocaust survivors are dying fast and it was important for us to create a platform where their voice will be heard, \"he said.

Thousands of Hong Kong residents are expected to return to the streets on Sunday to protest a controversial extradition bill, which the government has decided to suspend under pressure from massive protests in the past week. Protesters said on Saturday afternoon that Hong Kong leader <mark>Carrie Lam</mark>'s about-face decision to put the bill on ice did not appease them. \"I think the majority of Hong Kong people will not accept temporary suspension,\" said protester Thomas Hong, who was participating in a 10-person hunger strike outside government offices. <mark>Lam</mark> said she decided to suspend the proposed legislation, which is controversial because it would allow extraditions to China, as much of the public still has \"concerns and doubts about the bill .\" She emphasised the bill would not be revoked but simply suspended for further consultation. Protest organiser Civil Human Rights Front said Sunday's rally will serve to condemn the excessive use of force against demonstrators in the past week. Police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets against protesters on Wednesday, injuring 81 people. The organisers say they wanted to see the bill fully revoked and for <mark>Lam</mark> to step down. They were also asking the government to reclassify Wednesday's rally from riot to protest and release and not prosecute those arrested. Anger at the bill has united Hong Kong in a way not seen since major pro-democracy protests in 2014, as many fear it is a sign that the city is losing its autonomy to China.

Lower old season lamb prices weighed down the Eastern States Trade Lamb Indicator (ESTLI) last week resulting in a slip of about 20 cents a kilogram to 472c/kg. Mecardo market analyst Augusto Semmelroth said lamb markets had been relatively volatile during the past few weeks. He said weekly saleyard numbers had varied some 20 to 30 per cent week-on-week. \"Not only have yardings fluctuated considerably between weeks, but the quality of animals on offer has also varied, adding some extra volatility to Meat and Livestock Australia's National Livestock Reporting Service (NLRS) State indicators,\" Mr Semmelroth said. \"Despite the increasing number of new season lambs being consigned, they are still the minority of total yardings .\" As a result, the lower prices paid for old season lambs in plain condition continues to impact negatively on the overall performance of most indicators. \"Mr Semmelroth said the past week's rain might entice some producers to hold stock to heavier weights or restrict numbers of stock in plain condition from reaching the market .\" This could give some support for prices this week, \"he said. Although lamb supply at Cowra was reduced, the number of new season lambs dominated the yarding last Friday. Of the 6000 lambs offered, about 4000 of those were new season lambs. NLRS reported competition was good resulting in a firm to slightly dearer market. As a result, medium and heavy trade weight new season lambs were firm and averaged about 515c/kg. About 40pc of the yarding were young lambs from 22kg to 24kg and they topped at $128 a head. Old lamb of similar weight, by comparison, topped at $112 a head. Forbes Livestock and Agency Company director Tim Mackay said at Forbes on Tuesday the new season lambs made up about 50 per cent of the lamb yarding .\" There seems to be plenty of them about from the traditional supply areas and in the next few weeks I expect they will really start to flow into the market, \"he said. In the north of the State, Colin Say and Company agent <mark>Craig Thomas</mark> said the supply of new season lambs would be about three months away .\" The (dry) season has really had a big influence on the supply of lambs in this region, \"he said .\" Lots of lambs were sold into the south earlier in the year so we have few lambs being offered on the Northern Tablelands at the moment, \"he said. In the Tamworth district, Davidson <mark>Cameron</mark> McCulloch and Company branch manager Daniel McCulloch said there would be a gap in supply between the old lambs and new spring lambs .\" We are almost at the end of the old lambs and many people are choosing to send them into the sales at 19kg to 20kg rather than try to put more weight on them at this stage in the season, \"he said .\" The new season lambs are probably going to be a bit later than normal so I expect we will start to see the bulk of them starting to flow in late September and into October. \"Meanwhile, over-the-hooks lamb rates slipped another 10c/kg. Processors claim they have reduced price grids due to the number of new season lambs on the market. The 20kg to 22kg lambs have averaged 488c/kg, while the 24kg to 26kg category was on about 485c/kg. Wagga suckers limited but season shapes up well WITH plenty of old season lambs still on the market, the prime lamb sale at Wagga Wagga last week was as much as $10 a head cheaper. G.J. Hulm and Company agent Tyler Pendergast, Tumut, said it could be another month before new season lambs dominated the yardings at Wagga .\" At the sale last Thursday the suckers would have been about $10 a head cheaper, while the plainer, old lambs sold for even less, \"he said. To put supply into perspective, Mr Pendergast said in a yarding of about 30,000 lambs last week only 8000 were new season .\" By the middle of September there should be a few more spring lambs being offered and from what I've seen in clients' paddocks they are growing very well, \"he said .\" The mild winter and good feed mean the lambs are coming along really well and I expect when they are ready for market there will be some top lines being offered. \"Mr Pendergast, (pictured with colleague Mal Vogan, Tumbarumba, at last week's lamb sale) said sucker lambs were on par with previous years .\" I wouldn't say they are any earlier or later than past years, \"he said .\" We didn't get a lot of rain during the weekend like some of the northern areas of State did, but I expect it might mean the flow of lambs in the north will steady up. \"AgForce's Stacey Milner talks rural finance with Bentley's managing director <mark>Ben Cameron</mark>.
