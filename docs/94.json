\"you have to learn to like what you see in the mirror,\" she tells glamour. \"there are definitely times when i don't feel like myself, but you have to fake it until you make it .\" check out the rest of kim's kim looks so much more beautiful \"undone\" january 3rd, 2011 i don't think she's sexy at all, because it's all fake. if you look at pictures of her throughout the years, it's obvious how much work she's had done. her sister kourtney has natural beauty, so i don't understand why everyone's so crazy about kim. i agree - you're not sexy - you're plastic. anyone can look like that with a wallet like your's. all it takes is puffed lips - and no those are not natural how big she's blown them up to be? her boobs are fake - she's had those blown up, you can see the silicone base around the edges and how they don't fall naturally. the botox she finally admitted to and looks like a wax figure. kim, you don't look like a 20 year old - you look like a 30 year old in serious crisis. leah, umm you are confused. kourtney is the one that has said she has had implants. she is by far the \"natural\" one of the three girls. kim has not and the only thing she has done is botox. how can you say she is fake. she is gorgeous even as a small child. all those girls are beautiful, implants or not. please do not take this as an attack anyone but for those who keep saying she got work done? i mean yes her upper lip looks a little bigger on this picture ok, maybe she did get something done there or it could be some kind of lipstick the makeup artist used to plump them up more like they advertise on commercials? for the most part though what i wanted to suggest was? how do you guys know that throughtout the years her bone structure just didn't mature? i know it may sound crazy to some people but there are some people that do not contain the same baby face that they had while younger your bone structure changes throughout the years. things fill out and you may become wider than usual. i don't know her personally but i do know that she's beautiful rather real or fake. she already admitted to getting surgery done to her stomach because of past abusive relationship now that's over and done. what more do you want her say or do? no matter how real or fake she is she's still a gem. i do think kim is beautiful but i also think it's sad that she feels she has to wear that much make up at 30 years old. i don't think any woman needs to wear that much make up. kim has natural beauty and less make up would look better on her and she'd still be a knock out. umm? she's right. she's not sexy. too conceited (who tweets endless bikini pics of themselves?!) and narcissistic. she looks so much better with less makeup. zoom in on a pic of her - between the eyeliner, fake lashes, ten pounds of foundation - it's hard to tell where the real kim starts. add a comment got something to add to this post?
