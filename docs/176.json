back to 1942 during saturday's meeting with michigan, but the game's result continued a tradition established in the last decade. the no. 8 buckeyes rolled to their seventh consecutive win over rival michigan, beating the wolverines, 37-7, and clinching a share of their sixth straight big ten title in front of 105,491 fans at ohio stadium. as part of the nike pro combat series, osu wore custom-designed uniforms to honor the 1942 national championship team. the 2010 buckeyes (11-1, 7-1) likely won't be a part of any title game, but moved a step closer toward a bcs bowl invite with their ninth win in the last 10 games against michigan (7-5, 3-5). \"it's always the same feeling,\" linebacker ross homan said. \"every time we beat michigan, it's always a great feeling and a success.\" it took the buckeye offense a quarter to warm up on a chilly columbus afternoon. after a scoreless first frame, osu exploded for 24 points in the second quarter. devin barclay opened the scoring with a 33-yard field goal to cap a 10-play, 74-yard osu drive. \"they put in some schemes that we hadn't seen before, and it took us a little while to adjust to them,\" senior offensive lineman bryant browning said. \"i thought as the game went on, our offense was more effective.\" an 18-yard punt placed the buckeyes' next possession at the michigan 35-yard line. five plays later, quarterback terrelle pryor found dane sanzenbacher for a 7-yard touchdown. michigan responded with an 80-yard drive, culminating with a 1-yard touchdown run by <mark>michael shaw</mark>, but <mark>jordan hall</mark> returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards to push the osu lead to 17-7. \"words can't explain it,\" <mark>hall</mark> said. \"i've been waiting for it so long. we're supposed to give the ball to the ref after we score, but i don't even know where i put it.\" the buckeyes then cashed in on a lost fumble by michigan running back <mark>vincent smith</mark> with a 60-yard touchdown drive. pryor connected with devier posey across the middle, and the junior receiver dove into the end zone to increase osu's advantage. pryor completed 18 of 27 passes for 219 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. posey hauled in five catches for 81 yards. turnovers hindered michigan's first-half productivity. the wolverines twice turned the ball over on downs and also lost a pair of fumbles. \"we took advantage of their turnovers,\" pryor said. \"normally if you win the turnover margin, you have a good chance of winning.\" despite outgaining the buckeyes 258-229, michigan trailed 24-7 at halftime. quarterback denard robinson, widely considered the heisman trophy favorite throughout the first half of the season, rushed for 105 yards before intermission. however, coach <mark>rich rodriguez</mark> said at halftime that the sophomore dislocated a couple of fingers on his non-throwing hand. robinson sat out michigan's final drive of the first half and much of the second half. \"it wouldn't have been much of a problem, but he likes to grip it with that hand and he couldn't get any feeling back,\" <mark>rodriguez</mark> said. \"he tried to go back in the second half but he just couldn't do it. it's unfortunate because he was playing well today.\" sophomore tate forcier, whom the buckeyes picked off four times in ann arbor, mich., in last year's matchup, took over. he threw an interception on the first play after halftime. the buckeye running game struggled before the break. dan \"boom\" herron totaled minus-1 yards on five first-half carries. his fortunes changed in the third quarter. herron scored from 32 yards out on osu's opening drive of the second half, his 11th straight game with a touchdown. \"it was a strange game offensively where we kind of led with the pass in the first half and all of a sudden we got a couple turnovers and we are looking more at leading with the run the second half,\" coach jim tressel said. \"it wasn't like all of a sudden a snowstorm came in or something. it was just that's not what we needed to do and we always talk about we do what the team needs, and first half we needed to throw it.\" michigan punter will hagerup didn't travel to columbus after being suspended for what the team called \"a violation of team rules.\" after backup punter seth broekhulzen pinned the buckeyes at their own 2-yard line, herron thundered down the sideline to the end zone. a holding call against receiver dane sanzenbacher near the end of the run turned a 98-yard touchdown into an 89-yard pickup. herron's rush tied the school record for longest play from scrimmage. gene fekete gained 89 yards on a carry against pittsburgh in 1942. \"i didn't think it was a penalty but i don't make the calls,\" sanzenbacher said. \"i wouldn't change what i did if i could do the play again, if that makes it any better. sorry to boom to steal his touchdown. i was just trying to help clear the way for him to get into the end zone.\" herron finished with 22 carries for 175 yards, the third time he has topped the century mark in the last four contests. column: plenty of blame to go around for boise state's blown lead"},

"Celebrities pick the book that had the most impact on their lives Saturday, November 28, 2015 By Ail\u00edn Quinlan What is the book that had the most impact on your life? Ail\u00edn Quinlan asks three well-known people from the worlds of poetry, literature and broadcasting. Plus we recommend the best books to buy this Christmas. NORAH CASEY There are days you never forget in your life. August 31, 1997 was one of those. We were living in London at the time and woke that Sunday to the news of the tragic death of Princess Diana. Richard was a news correspondent for the BBC and was immediately despatched to Balmoral where most of the royal family were staying, leaving me alone in a shell-shocked city. READ NEXT Christmas 2015: The top book picks of the season There was a lot of criticism of the Queen at the time for failing to capture the mood of a nation in mourning and it was widely expected that she would travel from Scotland to London with Princes Harry and William the following day. \"London was a strange place to be at that time. Our house is close to Westminster and the outpouring of grief and growing mountain of floral tributes outside Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace was extraordinary and unsettling. The collective mourning of complete strangers over a woman the vast majority had never met or known other than through her media profile was profound.\" People were hugging each other, openly weeping as they queued for hours to sign books of condolence. It was impossible not to be captivated by the hysteria, even more so because Londoners are not known for expressing their emotions too readily. \"I returned home that Sunday afternoon after wandering through the sea of messages and flowers and couldn't settle. The television was showing an endless loop of the crash scene, her life, the crowds, the tears and worse the shock and abandonment that people felt at the loss of this one individual. Days earlier I had picked up a review copy of a book that had arrived into the newspaper. It held little promise for a lapsed Catholic. Anam Cara, a first book by an unknown author, John O\u2019Donoghue.\" Even more off-putting it promised \"spiritual wisdom from the Celtic world. I had nothing else to distract me so I settled down to plough through a few pages. I think I finished my first read around 3am the following morning and it is the only book I have read several times (too often to count) since. It was a constant companion by my bedside when my father died suddenly in his sleep 18 months later and it was the one I reached for when Richard died a few years ago.\" John O\u2019Donoghue's book became an unlikely bestseller that year, published on the day of Diana's death and reprinted 13 times. A former priest, poet, and philosopher, he received international acclaim for Anam Cara and the many insightful books her has written since. \"I could never do justice to the enlightenment contained within the pages of Anam Cara (which means Soul Friend) but it resonated strongly at a disconnected moment in time and the more I read it the more I get from it. He writes about love and friendship, about the bonds of two souls united, how solitude and silence soothes and reconnects us.\" His final chapter is on the serenity and peace of death and the fusion between those in the spiritual world who have left us, and our own. It is illuminating and comforting. John O\u2019Donoghue was only 53 when he passed away suddenly in 2008 but his life and his writings have left a wonderful legacy. \"<mark>MICHAEL MURPHY</mark> The book for me is Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, the poetry collection on which he worked all his life.\" Whitman first published it in 1855 at the start of his poetic career and kept adding to it and republishing throughout his life. \"These were revolutionary poems based on himself.\" He was a very modern poet--he was like the poetic version of Carl Jung and the wonderful thing about him, what really impressed me, was that he was stylistically innovative. \"He used ordinary language and abandoned the artificiality of rhyming patterns.\" It impacted very strongly on me as a budding poet. I came across the book when I was in my 20s on a JI Visa, working in New York. \"I picked up a copy of the book and could not put it down.\" It was saying everything I would have loved to say. I was writing poetry at the time and it transformed the way I did it. \"When I was younger, I thought that the way you write poetry was that everything rhymed.\" Then I suddenly realised that, many years before, a man had broken all the conventions. He was also obviously gay and wrote about sexuality. \"I realised this man had broken all the boundaries and was writing about nature, love and death and it opened my eyes in a good way.\" * <mark>Michael Murphy</mark> is a psychoanalyst, poet and RT\u00c9 television producer/director and newscaster. He recently published his latest collection of poetry, A Chaplet of Roses. Published by Toga Books (\u20ac 14.99), it is the second collection of poetry from the bestselling author. His highly acclaimed literary memoir, At Five in the Afternoon--My Battle with Male Cancer, was published in 2009, and was a number one bestseller. A sequel, The House of Pure Being, was published in 2013, and reached the top ten. The third and final part of that trilogy, Lemons and the Waning Moon, will be published in 2016. SE\u00c1N O\u2019ROURKE My book is Plain Speaking, by Merle Miller. \"It's an oral biography of Harry S Truman, and constitutes interviews with commentary.\" I first read it 30 years ago, and I've read it several times since, but there's one section that sticks with me. \"This particular passage is about an incident in which Truman fired General Douglas MacArthur, who had got above himself and had started making policy, which wasn't his job--he took it upon himself to usurp the authority of the President of the United States.\" For a while, Truman allowed himself to be talked out of firing General MacArthur, but eventually he did it--and he said he'd been wrong not to do it earlier. \"He says in the book:\" The only thing I learned out of the whole MacArthur deal is that when you feel there is something you have to do, and you know in your gut you have to do it, the sooner you get it over with the better off everybody is .' \"This is something I go back to; it's something I've drawn on--if I know there's something I have to face up to doing--just do it.\" Sometimes you put off what you know you have to do. \"The most recent thing for me was, that I had this lovely holiday home in Donegal.\" We bought it about 10 years ago, not knowing what would come in the way of recession and cutbacks, and it became a luxury we couldn't afford. \"Now I have decided to sell it. Even though it's in a gorgeous place near a beach and a golf course, my family never really bonded with it.\" I was asked if I'd sell it and to my amazement I said yes. \"My wife Caroline wanted to sell it years ago and I kept talking her out of it, but now it's at the Sale Agreed stage.\" Part of me feels that a bit of me has been amputated but I also feel it's the right thing for the family. \"I've loads of friends in Donegal and I'll never be stuck for a bed there, so I can still go there and enjoy the golf and the landscape.\" I've no regrets about getting the house in the first place, but I feel it's time to let it go. \"The MacArthur thing came to mind when I got the offer--we can spend a lot of time dodging what we have to do, but you have to face up to it in the end, and this applies to all parts of life, including family or work situations.\" * Journalist and broadcaster Se\u00e1n O\u2019Rourke currently presents the Today With Se\u00e1n O\u2019Rourke show every weekday morning on RT\u00c9 Radio One. LOUISE O\u2019NEILL I THINK the book that has most influenced me was a book given to me when I was in my teens by my English teacher Jo Keane. \"It was The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood.\" I remembering finishing that book and feeling as if the way I had looked at the world had changed in some way. \"So many facets of the world in which I lived, and the culture in which I was brought up, were so intrinsically patriarchal.\" I didn't have access to feminist theory, so that book was my first introduction to any idea of feminism. \"I feel it gave me the language in which to articulate myself and it radicalised me and made me a feminist.\" It was an incredibly important book for me and it changed my life. \"There are other books that made me want to be a writer but this made me politically aware and engaged with such issues--and more critical of the way the media presents women, and more aware of how we as a society and culture view women.\" The Handmaid's Tale was written the same year I was born--1985--and 15 years later when I read it, it still felt relevant. \"It is unfortunate that 30 years after it was published it is still so relevant.\" * Louise O' Neill is the author of Asking for It and Only Ever Yours"}, {"articleID": "2012120412_00050358_W", "names": {"Gary Allan": ["Q13550503", "Q1494805"]}, "date": "2012-12-04", "url": "http://foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/12/04/country-singer-gary-allan-giving-away-song-download-with-sandy-donations-to-red/", "content": "country singer <mark>gary allan</mark> attends the 59th annual bmi country awards in nashville. ap nashville, tenn. - country singer <mark>gary allan</mark> was supposed to play atlantic city, n.j., the day after hurricane sandy hit. he never made it, but his thoughts remain with victims of the storm, so he's come up with a way to help. fans can view the video for <mark>allan</mark>'s new single \"every storm (runs out of rain)\" on his website beginning tuesday on a special player. the player gives fans a chance to donate to the red cross. in return, donors get a free download of the song from <mark>allan</mark>'s untitled new album due out next year. scores of artists have reached out to help raise money in the wake of the superstorm, which killed dozens and did billions of dollars in damage in the northeastern u.s. print email share comments recommend tweet related stories tv host lights magician's head on fire during show hefner again set to marry \"number one girl': sexiest playboy love interest? a bachelorette no more: ashley hebert weds j.p. rosenbaum share this article newsletter signup sign up for free e-mail news alerts from foxnews.com and foxbusiness.com. newsletter signup view article you must login to comment. view article"}, {"articleID": "2019090920_00293654_W", "names": {"David Low": ["Q43119329", "Q52084303", "Q57412314"]}, "date": "2019-09-09", "url": "https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/national/almost-70-fires-burning-across-queensland-with-multiple-homes-lost/news-story/cfed8354529a72026722f730b65e033f", "content": "social-email_circle Police are allegedly speaking with a 12-year-old juvenile in relation to Queensland's bushfire crisis, it has been reported.

Courtney Cox (50) just got engaged to her Irish rocker boyfriend, John McDaid (37), who's 13-years her junior. May-December couples no longer raise eyebrows the way they did in the past.

hrs ago new york (reuters) - europe's debt crisis looks more intractable than ever. the federal reserve appears to be shooting blanks when it comes to firing up the u.s. economy. add in signs that chinese growth is slowing by the day, and it explains why financial markets took a hammering on thursday, with global stock markets, oil, metals and even gold sliding. and investors now fear there isn't much that authorities can do to stop the slide: central banks are running out of ammunition and political will among u.s. and european leaders is in short supply. even as central bankers and finance ministers from the world's largest economies met in washington, few were holding out hope for a miracle solution. \"people are losing confidence in policymakers altogether,\" said kathy lien, director of research at gft forex, an online retail currency platform. \"if they keep failing to boost growth and confidence, we may see the kind of deep global crisis we saw three years ago.\" in 2008, investment bank lehman brothers' collapse nearly brought down the entire american banking system and pushed much of the world economy into recession. this time, the main fault lines are in europe, where officials have struggled to come up with decisive plans to address a possible greek default and drum up resources to support other troubled countries and banks. but u.s. officials have hardly been more inspiring. fed policies look increasingly impotent, and political bickering ahead of the 2012 election has reached a fever pitch. \"popular trust in the agencies of government is declining everywhere,\" said <mark>robert madsen</mark>, senior fellow at the mit center for international studies. \"the pattern of a crisis followed two or three years later by a stark deterioration in political power is exactly what occurred in most of the major economies other than the united states in the early 1930s.\" that left governments grasping at bad policies such as protectionism, which halted world trade and deepened the depression in most economies. in germany, <mark>madsen</mark> noted, economic privation and distrust in leaders enabled the rise of hitler. \"i don't see anything like nazism happening now,\" he said, \"but the gradual erosion of centrist power seems almost inevitable.\" eye of the storm markets are already flashing signs of distress. the s & p 500 tumbled 3.2 percent thursday, its fourth straight decline, and european shares hit a 26-month low. copper crashed 7.5 percent to its lowest price in a year, benchmark brent crude oil fell more than 5 percent, while the 10-year treasury yield fell to 1.71 percent, its lowest in at least 60 years, as investors sought safety. investors worry a default in greece or elsewhere could spark a crisis for euro zone banks with a lot of troubled government debt on their balance sheets. david gilmore, principal of currency advisory firm foreign exchange solutions, said the lack of a common fiscal policy and bickering among national leaders does not inspire hope. \"i can't see how europe avoids a major crash in asset prices, the euro and the banking system, and i can't see how anywhere else on the planet avoids serious contagion,\" he said. seven world leaders urged europe on thursday to \"confront the debt overhang to prevent contagion to the wider global economy. possible remedies, such as recapitalizing european banks so they can cope with sovereign defaults or adopting a common eurobond for member states, have so far gained little traction. a european central bank study, co-authored by an outgoing executive board member, said the euro project is in danger due to runaway spending and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. the euro hit an eight-month low beneath $1.34 thursday, and there are predictions that it will fall further. barclays capital sees the euro falling to $1.25 in three months. fed out of ammo? many have taken the ecb to task for being slow to cut interest rates. the fed, meanwhile, appears to be all out of bullets--and markets know it. in 2008, the u.s. central bank cut rates sharply to zero and recently pledged to hold them there until at least 2013. it has also poured $2.3 trillion into the financial system through asset purchases, a policy that helped boost stock prices but did little for an economy where growth has slowed to a crawl and the jobless rate remains stuck above 9 percent. but the fed's latest move on wednesday--targeting lower long-term interest rates by selling treasuries with short maturities to buy longer-dated ones--was met with a sharp stock market selloff and widespread doubts about its ability to boost growth.\" it was a terrible omen, because the stock market had rallied like clockwork after previous fed policy moves as if it were christmas day, \"said michael cheah, who helps oversee $1.5 billion at sunamerica asset management.\" this was the first time the market reacted very badly. it shows they are out of magic dust. \"<mark>bill gross</mark>, manager of pimco, the world's largest bond fund, told reuters in august,\" it is increasingly apparent to us that policy options are limited and that economic growth is slowing down. \"with consumers not willing to spend and businesses wary of hiring, some investors have called for the government to step up spending to keep the economy afloat.\" without it, at best, we muddle along. at worst, we double dip, \"doug kass, who runs hedge fund seabreeze partners in palm beach, florida, wrote in a note to clients. policy paralysis but with the united states already running one of the largest budget deficits as a share of output since world war two, political opposition to such spending is high. president barack obama proposed a $447 billion job package this month but is facing stiff resistance from republicans, who object to tax hikes on the rich to pay for it. in the past 24 hours, markets even had the specter of a government shutdown to contend with after the house of representatives defeated a <mark>bill</mark> wednesday that would fund federal operations past september 30. republicans said the issue will be sorted out, but the flap

declarative and revolutionary as a line out of hemingway: \"okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond,\" chinua achebe wrote in \"things fall apart.\" africans, the nigerian author announced more than 50 years ago, had their own history, their own celebrities and reputations. achebe, the internationally celebrated nigerian author, statesman and dissident, who died at age 82 after a brief illness, continued for decades to rewrite and reclaim the history of his native country. achebe lived through and helped define revolutionary change in nigeria, from independence to dictatorship to the disastrous war between nigeria and the breakaway country of biafra in the late 1960s. he knew both the prestige of serving on government commissions and the fear of being declared an enemy of the state. he spent much of his adult life in the united states, but never stopped calling for democracy in nigeria or resisting literary honors from a government he refused to accept. photos: notable deaths in 2013 / 2012 even in traffic today in lagos, nigeria's largest city, hawkers sell pirated copies of his recent civil war memoir. \"what has consistently escaped most nigerians in this entire travesty is the fact that mediocrity destroys the very fabric of a country as surely as a war - ushering in all sorts of banality, ineptitude, corruption and debauchery,\" wrote achebe, whose death was confirmed friday by his literary agent, <mark>andrew wylie</mark>. his eminence worldwide was rivaled only by gabriel garcia marquez, toni morrison and a handful of others. achebe was a moral and literary model for countless africans and a profound influence on such american writers as ha jin, junot diaz and morrison, who once called achebe's work an \"education\" for her and \"liberating in a way nothing had been before.\" his public life began in his mid-20s. he was a resident of london when he completed his handwritten manuscript for \"things fall apart,\" a short novel about a nigerian tribesman's downfall at the hands of british colonialists. turned down by several publishers, the book was finally accepted by heinemann and released in 1958 with a first printing of 2,000. its initial review in the new york times ran less than 500 words, but the novel soon became among the most important books of the 20th century, a universally acknowledged starting point for postcolonial, indigenous african fiction, the prophetic union of british letters and african oral culture. \"it would be impossible to say how\" things fall apart' influenced african writing, \"the african scholar kwame anthony appiah once observed.\" it would be like asking how shakespeare influenced english writers or pushkin influenced russians. achebe didn't only play the game, he invented it. \"\"things fall apart\" has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide and has been translated into more than 50 languages. achebe also was a forceful critic of western literature about africa, especially joseph conrad's \"heart of darkness,\" standard reading for millions, but in achebe's opinion, a defining example of how even a great western mind could reduce a foreign civilization to barbarism and menace. \"now, i grew up among very eloquent elders. in the village, or even in the church, which my father made sure we attended, there were eloquent speakers. so if you reduce that eloquence which i encountered to eight words & it's going to be very different,\" achebe told the associated press in 2008. \"you know that it's going to be a battle to turn it around, to say to people,\" that's not the way my people respond in this situation, by unintelligible grunts, and so on; they would speak .' and it is that speech that i knew i wanted to be written down. \"his first novel was intended as a trilogy and the author continued its story in\" a man of the people \"and\" arrow of god. \"he also wrote short stories, poems, children's stories and a political satire,\" the anthills of savannah, \"a 1987 release that was the last full-length fiction to come out in his lifetime. achebe, who used a wheelchair in his later years, would cite his physical problems and displacement from home as stifling to his imaginative powers. achebe never did win the nobel prize, which many believed he deserved, but in 2007 he did receive the man booker international prize, a $120,000 honor for lifetime achievement. achebe, paralyzed from the waist down since a 1990 auto accident, lived for years in a cottage built for him on the campus of bard college, a leading liberal arts school north of new york city where he was a faculty member. he joined brown university in 2009 as a professor of languages and literature. achebe, a native of ogidi, nigeria, regarded his life as a bartering between conflicting cultures. he spoke of the\" two types of music \"running through his mind - ibo legends and the prose of dickens. he was also exposed to different faiths. his father worked in a local missionary and was among the first in their village to convert to christianity. in achebe's memoir\" there was a country, \"he wrote that his\" whole artistic career was probably sparked by this tension between the christian religion \"of his parents and the\" retreating, older religion \"of his ancestors. he would observe the conflicts between his father and great uncle and ponder\" the essence, the meaning, the worldview of both religions. \"for much of his life, he had a sense that he was a person of special gifts who was part of an historic generation. achebe was so avid a reader as a young man that his nickname was\" dictionary. \"at government college, umuahia, he read shakespeare, dickens, robert louis stevenson and jonathan swift among others. he placed his name alongside an extraordinary range of alumni - government and artistic leaders from jaja wachukwa, a future ambassador to the united nations; to future nobel laureate <mark>wole soyinka</mark>; achebe's future wife (and mother of their four children) christine okoli; and the poet christopher okigbo, a close friend of achebe's who was killed during the biafra war. after graduating from the university college of ibadan, in 1953, achebe was a radio producer at the nigerian broadcasting corp., then moved to london and worked at the british broadcasting corp. he was writing stories in college and called\" things fall apart \"an act of\" atonement \"for what he says was the abandonment of traditional culture. the book's title was taken from poet <mark>william butler</mark> yeats'\" the second coming, \"which includes the widely quoted line,\" things fall apart; the centre cannot hold. \"his novel was nearly lost before ever seen by the public. when achebe finished his manuscript, he sent it to a london typing service, which misplaced the package and left it lying in an office for months. the proposed book was received coolly by london publishers, who doubted the appeal of fiction from africa. finally, an educational adviser at heinemann who had recently traveled to west africa had a look and declared:\" this is the best novel i have read since the war. \"in mockery of all the western books about africa, achebe ended\" things fall apart \"with a colonial official observing okonkwo's fate and imagining the book he will write:\" the pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower niger. \"achebe's novel was the opening of a long argument on his country's behalf.\" literature is always badly served when an author's artistic insight yields to stereotype and malice, \"achebe said during a 1998 lecture at harvard university that cited joyce cary's\" mister johnson \"as a special offender.\" and it becomes doubly offensive when such a work is arrogantly proffered to you as your story. some people may wonder if, perhaps, we were not too touchy, if we were not oversensitive. we really were not. \"achebe could be just as critical of his own country. the novels\" a man of the people \"and\" no longer at ease \"were stories of corruption and collapse that anticipated the nigerian civil war of 1967-70 and the years of mismanagement that followed. he not only supported biafra's independence, but was a government envoy and a member of a committee that was to write up the new and short-lived country's constitution. he would flee from nigeria and return many times and twice refused the country's second-highest award, the commander of the order of the federal republic, over the lawlessness in his home state of anambra. in 2011, nigeria's presidency said achebe's refusal\" clearly flies in the face of the reality of nigeria's current political situation. \"achebe responded that\" a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. \"\"i had a strong belief that we would outgrow our shortcomings under leaders committed to uniting our diverse peoples,\" achebe warned. besides his own writing, achebe served for years as editor of heinemann's \"african writer series,\" which published works by nadine gordimer, stephen biko and others. he also edited numerous anthologies of african stories, poems and essays. in \"there was a country,\" he considered the role of the modern african writer. \"what i can say is that it was clear to many of us that an indigenous african literary renaissance was overdue,\" he wrote. \"a major objective was to challenge stereotypes, myths, and the image of ourselves and our continent, and to recast them through stories - prose, poetry, essays, and books for our children. that was my overall goal.\" "}, {"articleID": "2012011310_00070725_W", "names": {"Puja Gupta": ["Q16729508",

Follow | Archive TORONTO--As the Toronto Blue Jays finish off playing out the string, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is already looking forward to the off-season. But it's not because he's desperate for the downtime after playing into the month of September for the first time in his life. Rather, it's a chance to start the process of reshaping his body and, dare I use the clich\u00e9, come into spring training next February in the best shape of his life in an effort to make third base his long-term home and be better prepared for the 162-game grind. \"I think that's the key for me to have a great year next year,\" Guerrero said. \"I feel good the way I am right now, but I'm going to try to come back a lot better. Maybe try to be 15 or 20 pounds less for spring training and I will take it from there after that.\" Vladdy Jr. plans on heading back to the Dominican Republic to train with his uncle, Wilton Guerrero, just as they've always done, but he's debating showing up at the Blue Jays' facility in Dunedin for a stretch, as well, something the team has been hoping he'd consider. \"I'm going to go back to the Dominican and work out with my family,\" Guerrero said. \"We do that every off-season, and then maybe I'll go back to Tampa for a month to work out with the team.\" Listed at 250 pounds this season as a 20-year-old, Guerrero's playing weight--depending on who you talk to--has fluctuated between 255 and 270 since he made his major-league debut at the end of April. If Guerrero can even come close to replicating his dedication in the cage and apply it to his conditioning, there's no reason to think he won't arrive in Dunedin next spring feeling better prepared to take the next step in his development. You don't have to look far for a prime example of what happens when a young player changes his routines away from the field. In 2018, as a 21-year-old, Boston Red Sox third baseman Rafael Devers faced the same questions. A top 10 prospect in baseball before his arrival in 2017 as a 20-year-old, Devers struggled last season, slashing just .240 / .298 / .433 with 21 home runs, while also pacing baseball in miscues with the leather, committing 24 errors at third base. From the prospect pedigree to conditioning to questions about the glove, there are so many parallels between the two young Dominican stars. The Devers plan is the blueprint and it's been laid out on the table for Vladdy to follow. \"I know Raffy very well, but everybody's different,\" said Guerrero, who has admitted to not spending much time in the gym in the past. \"I have my own plan with my uncle and we're going to work very hard and I believe I'm going to come back strong.\" Guerrero has already been telling friends around baseball, including countryman and Red Sox third base coach Carlos Febles, to expect to see a different player next spring. \"He's a big guy and he's athletic, but something Vladdy told me last night is,\" I'm going to go this off-season and get in the best shape possible and you'll see me next year. I'm going to be a different guy, \"' Febles relayed.\" He wants to be good and he knows what he needs to do. His dad already told him. He said, \"My dad is already on top of me about it .' You'll see him. He'll be better because he's hungry.\" Devers' dedication paid off in a big way and he's put together a monster campaign. At the plate, he's been one of the best hitters in baseball this season, slashing .307 / .359 / .551 with a career-high 31 homes and a whopping 85 extra-base hits, overall. Defensively, Devers has still committed 22 errors--second-most in baseball behind Chicago White Sox shortstop <mark>Tim Anderson</mark>'s 25--but the metrics and reports have generally been a lot more favourable and he's viewed as a perfectly acceptable bat-first third baseman. \"It was about him making that commitment and understand why you have to be in better shape,\" Febles said. \"If you want to be good, you better do it, and that's exactly what he did.\" Meeting the expectations Guerrero's season has not gone as planned. But that's not to say it hasn't been a success, either. To understand why a .276 / .345 / .444 slash line as a 20-year-old is a bit of a disappointment to some, you have to understand the enormous expectations heaped upon him. He was--and still is--dubbed a generational talent. Many, math model projections included, thought he'd be an elite-level bat from the jump. At times, he's looked like just that, but the same sort of machine-like consistency that we saw during his journey through the minor leagues hasn't been there. Getting beat inside at times and swinging at pitches he normally wouldn't have led to an elevated ground-ball rate at 49 per cent. As a right-handed hitter with an elite hit tool, it's almost shocking to see he's batting just .219 / .301 / .352 with nine extra-base hits in 143 plate appearances against southpaws. Even the elite exit velocities have dwindled as the season has gone on, perhaps a sign that Guerrero is tiring physically. That's something Red Sox hitting coach Tim Hyers has noticed with Devers. \"When you're mentally and physically ready to go, we're seeing the byproduct of that,\" Hyers said. \"When you are in shape, you can come in every day and get the work in and not get worn out. I think that really helped him out.\" How long at the hot corner? With all that being said, no one is questioning the hitting prowess or the ultimate ceiling in that area. It's the definition of a middle-of-the-order bat, even if he hasn't gone all <mark>Juan Soto</mark> or Yordan Alvarez on the baseball world. But the glove is another story, a narrative that's just beginning to take shape. The plan was always to bring Guerrero up as a third baseman and hope the tough balance of trying to develop while also produce at the major-league level wasn't too much of a burden. That's easy to do in a rebuild setting, but as wins become more important in 2020 and beyond, below-average defence will become a problem and the glove will be under the microscope. Both the eye test and the metrics haven't been kind through Vladdy Jr.'s first 92 games at third base in a Blue Jays uniform. His defensive fWAR of -8.9 sits dead last in baseball among third basemen. Only Devers has made more errors than Guerrero's 17, but that's come in 500 more innings played. His Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) mark of -3 is 42nd out of 56 third baseman with at least 200 innings in the field this season. There is a base set of skills, however, and Blue Jays infield instructor <mark>Luis Rivera</mark> again pointed to the Devers comparison when talking about Guerrero's glove. \"It's a great example,\" <mark>Rivera</mark> said. \"They're both Dominican, they both play third base and they're both young and they know they have to work a little bit on their body. Devers did a great job this year coming into spring training when we watched him early in the season and now here, he looks great. Hopefully, that's the same case with Vladdy, that he goes back home and continues to work on his body and come back to spring training in great shape.\" One move to acquire a defensively viable glove to install at the hot corner could change plans in an instant, but the Blue Jays front office knows how valuable their franchise player could be at third base, compared to a move across the diamond to first. They seem committed to keeping Vladdy at third in 2020, but beyond that all bets are off. \"He's got to go home [this off-season] and get his rest. He always likes to hit a lot, but he's got to come to spring training in a better situation where he can play the whole season without any worries and feel like he can go out every day and play third base,\" <mark>Rivera</mark> said. \"He's 20 years old. His body's got to get better, but his hands are good and his reactions are good. Time will tell. The conditioning that he applies to himself during the off-season in the years to come will dictate if he's going to stay there or not.\" "}]
