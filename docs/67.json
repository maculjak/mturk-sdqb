expected to continue past easter, pushing state lawmakers closer to the end of their 30-day special legislative session. senate democratic leaders still were hanging on to a temporary sales tax increase thursday as part of their $800 million tax package to bridge a $2.8 billion budget gap. their inability to get 25 votes for other substitute taxes appears to be a major sticking point with the house, which says it can't get votes for a sales tax. \"we've got some big hurdles to get over; (we're) somewhat maybe slightly closer but some big hurdles to get over,\" senate democratic caucus chairman <mark>ed murray</mark> of seattle said thursday. <mark>murray</mark> said the senate democrats, who have zero support from the gop for raising taxes, have \"a variety\" of plans they are talking about, and some of them might not include the sales tax. he also said the sales tax is less likely to survive in any final agreement. <mark>murray</mark> disputed reports that a tax deal was at hand, and he dismissed claims by house leaders that senate majority leader <mark>lisa brown</mark>, d-spokane, had a new proposal in the works to break the deadlock. gov. chris gregoire called lawmakers in for the overtime session after the house and senate were unable to find votes for a tax package and supplemental operating budget in their regular, 60-day session. the special session started march 15, which makes april 13 the new deadline to finish. minority republicans are complaining about the costs of the session and a lack of action on bills that spur job creation. so far, session costs are about $170,000, according to estimates from the house and senate administrative offices. the house has estimated that its costs have been as low as $1,000 on days when most members are gone, as they were thursday; on actual session days, costs are higher, but not as high as during regular session because there is less staffing and many members turn down their $90-a-day per diem. despite the lack of progress, the house is set to be back in full session today to consider an enhanced-911 emergency system tax on cell phones, which the senate approved thursday. house democrats also are learning about a new approach to temporary worker layoffs, which labor unions are fighting. the latter piece is a key element in any final budget agreement. house speaker frank chopp, d-seattle, said he, majority leader <mark>brown</mark> and others keep talking about taxes, and he credited <mark>brown</mark> with a new approach that might break the tax deadlock. \"i think <mark>lisa</mark> was potentially working on a new approach on the revenue. so we're looking forward to seeing what she has in mind,\" chopp said. <mark>brown</mark> plans a meeting with reporters today, but <mark>murray</mark> said there was no new deal or proposal in the works. rather, senate democrats are working individually with members and asking whether changes to a variety of proposals might win or retain their votes, <mark>murray</mark> said. the dispute over taxes is more complicated than whether the senate can simply drop its proposal for a 0.2 percent temporary sales tax. that is because the senate is holding firm on raising $800 million in new revenue to blunt cuts that are likely to exceed $4 billion over the 2009-11 budget cycle. but to reach that level of revenues without $200 million from the sales tax requires senate members to accept other tax ideas for which <mark>brown</mark> and <mark>murray</mark> are unable to get 25 votes, including a tax on some first-mortgage interest earnings of banks; adding sales tax to custom software transactions; and ending a sales-tax exemption for out-of-state residents, whose purchases help border-county businesses. on the flip side, the house opposes repeal of a $10 million tax break for coal purchases by the transalta power plant in centralia and other senate proposals. gregoire planned a meeting with chopp and <mark>brown</mark> late thursday, and house majority leader lynn kessler said she was hopeful that some kind of agreement will be reached next week. if that happens, kessler said, lawmakers will return april 9 and try to finish by sunday, april 11. staff writer jordan schrader contributed to this report.", "articleID": "2010040212_00085746_W", "names": {"Ed Murray": ["Q19604849", "Q5335211",

connecticut college lacrosse team, a squad that is off to a great start. in a big nescac rivalry game last weekend, the camels beat the nation's fifth-ranked team in division 3, middlebury, 8-7, scoring the game-winning goal with under three minutes to play. when the latest united states intercollegiate lacrosse association poll was released this past monday, the camels were ranked no. 10 nationally. last tuesday they pulled off their second straight one-goal victory, 12-11, over keene state in the rain. the 6-foot, 180-pound driscoll has a new position this year at defensive midifielder. he has scooped up 24 ground balls in the team's first seven games, all wins (including 3-0 in league play). after being an offensive threat his entire career, driscoll has made the switch to defensive responsibilities with ease. the success this year has been largely due to unselfish play, and driscoll, a two-time captain who starred at peabody high before transferring to pomfret, is a perfect example. \"sean has been a selfless leader for our team this year,\" said head coach dave cornell, a two-time all-american at gettysburg college. \"he was our leading scorer his freshman year and missed sophomore season due to a leg injury. following a tough year (as a junior), we asked him to take a look at the short stick d-mid position .\" cornell recalled driscoll never hesitating before telling him this was his senior year; he'd do whatever cornell thought would help the team. cornell said that willingness to switch positions says it all about driscoll, who is a great competitor and always puts the team first. conn college has posted wins over farmingdale state, amherst, clarkson, plymouth state, and trinity. the 10-8 win over amherst was the first victory over the lord jeffs since 2001. driscoll and freshman defenseman brogan o'connor of st. john's prep are the two local players on the squad. the camels know every team will be looking to end the unbeaten streak. they take on nescac rival bowdoin in a key game on the road this afternoon. driscoll was also just named to the nescac's winter all-academic team. students must be a varsity letterwinner and have a cumulative average of 3.35 or better. driscoll was a two-year hockey captain for the camels. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 the second annual charity flag football game at manning field in lynn last weekend was a huge success. the biggest winner was the make-a-wish foundation, which received $3,392 from the family-friendly event. police and fire departments from peabody, lynn, salem and beverly competed in the exciting games. the money raised came from ticket sales at the gate and at each department participating, donations from local businesses, raffle tickets and from the north shore flag football league. donations from local businesses paid for the t-shirts worn by the teams. roland james, a former new england patriot, handled the coin toss for the peabody vs. lynn fire department game, and stayed around to sign autographs for the kids. the boston militia women's pro football team was also on hand to raffle off team apparel and held a 50/50 raffle that raised over $200 for make-a-wish. pop warner ran a concession stand to raise money for the league. the make a wish foundation sent four volunteers to help out at the gate, and the flag football league donated the flags for the games. \"the weather was great, the games were great and everything ran smoothly,\" said nsffl founder austin bradshaw, who organized the event. \"this event will only get bigger and better every year .\" i have already been contacted by the departments to discus what we can work on for next year. the two new teams, salem and beverly, told me they are in for next year's event. we may move it to peabody or beverly and possibly have it before the football season opens in august, because the weather is so unpredictable this time of year. \"local businesses that helped sponsor the departments included murphy's restaurant and bar, engine house pizza, pickled onion, fibber mcgee's, <mark>paddy kelly</mark>'s, champions pub, lynn fire union and the police athletic club. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 new notre dame football coach <mark>brian kelly</mark>, the former st. john's prep football player, has been busy lately. he was the first speaker at the 14th annual key bank gridiron legends luncheon series at the college hall of fame in irving, texas. the series, which runs from march through june, is open to the general public, and <mark>kelly</mark> spoke to a sold out crowd last month. <mark>kelly</mark> will also receive the 2010 lee tressel ohio college coach of the year award later this month. he is being honored for his work as the highly successful head coach at the university of cincinnati prior to being hired at notre dame. \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 \u00ac \u00a2 after 41 years at the ipswich high helm, ken spellman has stepped down as the tigers' head spring track coach and indoor coach pat rich has taken over. the tigers also have a new girls coach in marty binette. he replaces micki mcvann, who had coached the team for six years .\" ken is the best assistant coach anybody could have, \"said rich .\" just because he's no longer the head coach doesn't mean he's not around; he's there every single day and is a tremendous help. i'm delighted he is so involved because he has so much knowledge to share. \"jean deplacido is a part-time writer and columnist for the salem news. contact her at

could pull out of the territory, citing a risk to their reputation that would harm their business elsewhere. in a challenge to the west bank-based palestine monetary authority (pma), hamas last month seized around $400,000 from a gaza bank branch whose management had frozen the funds to comply with global anti-money laundering regulations. it was the first time hamas, which has run gaza since 2007, had challenged the authority of the ramallah-based pma--a body that regulates banks operating in the west bank and the gaza strip. hamas said the funds were seized from a local bank in line with a court order challenging the ramallah-based authorities' decision to freeze assets belonging to a medical association. the pma had frozen the funds after the board of the patient's friend association had come under hamas control. analysts said it was only a matter of time before the pma's efforts to comply with international regulations on dealing with groups such as hamas, listed as a terrorist organisation by the united states, brought it into confrontation with the movement. \"all of us are concerned. the banks are concerned and we are equally concerned,\" pma head jihad al-wazir told reuters. bank executives raised their concerns a day after the seizure in a meeting with the pma in ramallah. taher al-nono, spokesman for the hamas government in gaza, said the banks' concerns were unfounded. \"we respect the banking system in palestine,\" nono said. of the 19 banks in the palestinian territories, 12 have branches in the gaza strip. they hold deposits valued at some $900 million. total deposits held by palestinian banks are valued at $7 billion. only local and arab banks operate in gaza but international bank hsbc has a branch in the west bank. the gaza banks have continued to operate since hamas seized control of the territory in 2007 after defeating forces loyal to president <mark>mahmoud abbas</mark>. the prospect of hamas imposing its will on the institutions again could force many to shut down, senior bankers said, citing a risk stemming from global anti-money laundering regulations. their ability to do business elsewhere would be damaged if they were seen to be cooperating with the group, they said. \"banks may take protective measures such as low-profiling or even closing their gaza branches to protect their existence elsewhere,\" said a senior bank official. another banker said: \"if one bank shuts down, other banks will follow .\" the bankers also expressed concern at hamas's plan to levy taxes on businesses in the gaza strip. in a feb. 7 letter sent to banks and other businesses, the hamas-run finance ministry in gaza asked for the payment of taxes it said had not been paid since 2007. a copy of the letter was seen by reuters. a pma official said: \"we told banks to put it in the shredder .\" israeli banks severed ties with banks in the gaza strip in 2007 after the jewish state declared it an \"enemy entity\". \"gaza branches face either lowering their profiles or shutting down,\" said <mark>mahmoud</mark> al-ram \"a, the general manager of palestine islamic bank.", "articleID": "2010040815_00077123_W",
