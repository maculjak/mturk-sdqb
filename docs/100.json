She was 94. Her friend and literary agent, Joni Evans, confirmed her death. From hardscrabble nights writing snippets for a Hearst newspaper in the 1950s to golden afternoons at Le Cirque with Sinatra or Hepburn and t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate dinners with Madonna to gather material for columns that ran six days a week, <mark>Smith</mark> captivated millions with her tattletale chitchat and, over time, ascended to fame and wealth that rivaled those of the celebrities she covered. A self-effacing, good-natured, vivacious Texan who professed to be awed by celebrities, <mark>Smith</mark> was the antithesis of the brutal columnist J.J. Hunsecker in Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman's screenplay for Sweet Smell of Success, which portrayed sinister power games in a seamy world of press agents and nightclubs. Her column, called simply \"<mark>Liz Smith</mark>,\" ran in The New York Daily News from 1976-91; in New York Newsday from 1991-995, when that newspaper closed; continued in Newsday until 2005 and, with some overlap, in The New York Post from 1995-2009--a 33-year run that morphed onto the internet in the New York Social Diary. She was not an exceptional writer or reporter, although there were occasional scoops--the 1990 split of Donald and Ivana Trump, Madonna's 1996 pregnancy--but her income often exceeded $1 million a year, more than any newspaper columnist or executive editor. Her style was not the intimidating jugular attack of columnists who expose intimacies or misdeeds in the private lives of public figures, thriving on Schadenfreude and sometimes damaging reputations. Nor, for the sake of a titillating item, did she seize upon ugly rumors or tasteless embarrassments. And gossip was hardly the only ingredient of her columns, which were sprinkled with notes on books or films, bits of political commentary and opinions about actors, authors and other notables. But journalism's watchdogs accused her, with some justification, of conflicts of interest, of lacking objectivity and distance from those she wrote about. \"It's a valid criticism, I suppose,\" <mark>Smith</mark> said in a 1991 interview with The New York Times. Mary <mark>Elizabeth Smith</mark> was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on Feb. 2, 1923, daughter of Sloan and Sarah McCall <mark>Smith</mark>. Her father was a cotton broker whose gambling problems and fading income during the Great Depression forced the family to sell their home and move. After high school, she attended Hardin-Simmons University, a Baptist-affiliated college in Abilene, and met George E. Beeman, whom she married and divorced. She leaves no immediate survivors."}, {"articleID": "2018010808_00257666_W", "names": {"Stephen Farrell": ["Q27824992", "Q7609177", "Q7609179"], "John Lewis": ["Q14945660", "Q16227288", "Q18922034", "Q19565272", "Q19875174", "Q20733531", "Q20733533", "Q21462286", "Q21462293", "Q21518827", "Q28075578", "Q30611710", "Q45380", "Q51070193", "Q56597791", "Q56604623", "Q56678781", "Q58195543", "Q6244734", "Q6244736", "Q6244742", "Q6244753", "Q6244757", "Q6244759", "Q6244761", "Q6244764"]}, "date": "2018-01-08", "url": "http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/yorkshire/town-centre-securities-appoints-john-lewis-director", "content": "<mark>Stephen Farrell</mark> Digital Staff Writer Town Centre Securities appoints <mark>John Lewis</mark> director 8 Jan 2018 Yorkshire Business <mark>Stephen Farrell</mark> Leeds-based property developer and investor Town Centre Securities has appointed the property director at department store chain <mark>John Lewis</mark> to its board.

growth in ipad and iphone sales for the fiscal 2011 third quarter, on its way to quarterly revenues of $28.57 billion and net profit of $7.31 billion. in all, apple sold 20.34 million iphones during the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 142 percent. it also sold 9.25 million ipads, good for a year-over-year increase of 183 percent. sales of 3.95 million macs represented a 14 percent increase from the same quarter in 2010. \"we sold every ipad we could make,\" cfo <mark>peter oppenheimer</mark> told analysts and media listening to apple's july 19 earnings call, while suggesting that significant majorities of the fortune 500 were studying how to best integrate the bestselling tablet into their employees' workflow. the iphone is also apparently enjoying an uptick in adoption among enterprise users. as with previous quarters, apple also faced a significant decline in ipod sales: 7.54 million units sold, a 20 percent dip from the year-ago quarter. the company traditionally ascribes this softness in media-player sales to cannibalization by the iphone. \"we're thrilled to deliver our best quarter ever, with revenue up 82 percent and profits up 125 percent,\" apple ceo steve jobs wrote in a july 19 statement accompanying the numbers. \"right now, we're very focused and excited about bringing ios 5 and icloud to our users this fall.\" even before apple's july 19 earnings report, analysts and pundits had turned their attention to the backend of 2011, when the company is expected to release a host of new software-including the mac os x \"lion\" and ios 5 operating systems-along with a new iphone. \"the concern on [wall street] seems to be more about the outlook for the third quarter,\" tony ursillo, an analyst with loomis sayles & co, told reuters july 15, \"ongoing supply constraints for the ipad and the timing of the iphone introduction.\" for many, questions (and buzz) are growing around the nature of that iphone rollout. the blog boy genius report, citing \"new information from an incredibly solid source,\" posted july 18 that apple is planning to launch a no-contract iphone priced at $350. \"it's entirely possible that the low-cost iphone will in fact be the iphone 3gs,\" that posting added. \"we are told that apple will continue to sell the current iphone 4 as well, finally giving the company a full range of devices in the lower, mid, and high-end price segments.\" but apple likes to keep its future plans shrouded in secrecy, and company executives on the july 19 earnings call were tight-lipped about the iphone's future. <mark>oppenheimer</mark> did reveal, however, that apple plans on launching the latest version of mac os x 10.7 \"lion\" july 20. the latest version of apple's long-running mac os x franchise includes full-screen applications, tweaks to the user interface (such as disappearing scroll bars and an increased range of gesture controls) and an airdrop feature that wirelessly shoots files to other users. ios 5 and icloud will launch during the fall timeframe, along with a \"major product transition that we won't talk about.\" that could be the closest thing to an actual iphone reference.

(AFP) Loading...The distance from Haridwar to Perth, as the very tired crow flies, is 7943 kilometres. But, when you see just how far Rishabh Pant has come in his cricketing journey, even this humongous number seems small. In the first Test against Australia in Adelaide, Pant kept wickets, Pant batted, hell, without knowing it Pant was even commentator for one over when host broadcaster Fox decided to silence their men and allow the chirp from the wicketkeeper to Pat Cummins to inform the world on the state of play. In a Test match where the record for the most number of catches was broken--there were 35 in all--it felt right that the wicketkeeper had the lion's individual share, 11 catches. There might have been a 12th and a world record, but Pant's dive to his right to try and hold onto a healthy edge from <mark>Nathan Lyon</mark>, fell short and he had to be content with drawing level with England's <mark>Jack Russell</mark> and South Africa's AB de Villiers. There was another miss, not quite a drop, when Pant failed to get a glove to ball from a Tim Paine edge. But, you don't dwell on what went begging when someone has played his part in sealing a famous victory. Pant is playing only his sixth Test match and he knows better than anyone else what his limitations are behind the stumps. He will no doubt work on improving his footwork, which will help him attempt more catches with two hands rather than one. His anticipation can only get better as he closely watches the best in the world, how they bat and what the ball does in response to certain strokes. (AP Photo) With the bat, Pant is all excitement. Or none at all. When called to, he can block it, but he'd rather not. His natural instincts are to attack and the manner in which he picked up a full ball from Mitchell Starc in India's first innings and dinked it over backward square for six was pure Twenty20 magic. Pant made 25 and 28 in his two innings, 36 of 53 runs coming off only eight deliveries in boundaries. But while that contribution in this Test, a low scoring one, was adequate, the fact that he has predominantly two gears, first and overdrive, would not have missed the attention of opposition bowlers, coaches and video analysts. A case in point was when <mark>Lyon</mark> packed the off side field with slip, silly point, gully, point and two short covers and bowled his hard spun quick off breaks, Pant found it almost impossible to get off strike. He either had to take the high-risk option playing across the line or slog the ball over the infield. To his credit, he managed to strike a few clean blows, but the fact that he could not then make the most of it has been noticed by many, including the coach of the Indian team. \"You have to allow him to play his game, but he has to be a little more sensible now,\" said Shastri after the first Test. \"He did the hard work in getting <mark>Lyon</mark> to spread his fields, so he has to be smarter. You make a mistake now, but don't repeat it, then I'll be in his ears.\" It would be wise for Pant to engage in course correction on his own for he does not want to get a reputation for having only one style of play. Whether he works with fielding coach R Sridhar, reaches out to those who have helped him get where he is or learn by himself, he has to work on becoming a more complete batsman, one who can be relied on to work the singles, rotate the strike and keep the scoreboard ticking along when the big shots are taken out of the equation. Pant credited Mahendra Singh Dhoni for being a major influence in his evolution. \"He's (Dhoni) the hero of the country,\" Pant told the Cricket Australia website soon after the first Test. \"I've learnt a lot from him as a person and as a cricketer as well. Whenever he's around I feel more confident as a person. If I've got any problems I can share it with him and get a solution right away. As a wicketkeeper and as a player he has taught me to be patient in pressure situations. You have to keep calm and keep composed and give 100%.\" Working hard and giving 100% are things that this lot of international cricketers do not shy away from at any stage. That should be a given. What is not is skill levels and the ability to grow as a cricketer. When Pant adds that to his personality, he has the potential to become a superstar in front of the stumps and an invaluable asset behind them.

Two things look to be definite on Saturday. Kentucky Derby champion Nyquist will be the favorite for the 141st running of the Preakness, and the weather is going to be lousy. Recent weather reports call for a chilly day, with temperatures in the 50s, and a 100 percent chance for rain. Is that good for Nyquist? The unbeaten champ has run on an off track only once in his eight-race career, when he romped to a 31/4-length win in the Florida Derby on a Gulfstream Park track labeled \"good.\" \"We've seen that Nyquist can handle a bit of weather at Churchill Downs,\" trainer Doug O'Neill said, referring to a hard rain an hour and a half before the Kentucky Derby. \"The Florida Derby, it rained pretty good, too. He is a sure-footed horse. Whatever the weather will be, I think he'll show up and run his race.\" One horse who should relish an off track is Nyquist's arch-rival, Exaggerator. The Keith Desormeaux - trained colt has won two of his three career starts on an off track. Exaggerator was most impressive in his latest trip on a sloppy track. That was the April 9 Santa Anita Derby, at which he sloshed to a 61/4-length win and earned the highest speed figure (103) of his career. Nyquist was not in the field that day. Exaggerator has faced Nyquist four times this season and finished second twice. Exaggerator was a fast-closing second in the Derby, beaten by 11/4 lengths. Desormeaux was not working on a victory speech after finding out about the weather forecast. A sloppy track doesn't guarantee that Exaggerator will turn the tables on Nyquist. \"I don't know if it's a matter of our horse moving up on an off track,\" Desormeaux said. \"It's more of the fact that my horse handles it so well, whereas other horses have not run in the slop. The track we ran on at Santa Anita was a quagmire. The fact that he got over it so well gives me an advantage, but I don't know if it moves me up.\" twilkin @ timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5415 \u2022 @ tjwilkin This is a TU + story.

rex ryan stepped to the podium, looked out at the cameras and opened his news conference with a warning. \"you're not going to believe this one,\" the jets coach declared without any hint of a smile. in what has been a bizarre season, the jets' wacky quarterback situation took yet another twist. greg mcelroy has a concussion - which he didn't reveal until thursday - and will be replaced by <mark>mark sanchez</mark> as the starting quarterback in the season finale at buffalo on sunday. \"we've come to find out that greg wasn't exactly truthful with our training staff after the game,\" said ryan, who acknowledged he was \"stunned\" to hear the news. \"he never disclosed that he had symptoms after the game to our trainers. right now, he's being evaluated for a concussion.\" mcelroy, preparing to make his second nfl start in place of the benched <mark>sanchez</mark>, was lifting weights thursday morning and started experiencing headaches, ryan said. mcelroy went to the team's training staff and then revealed he was suffering concussion-like symptoms after being sacked 11 times in the jets' 27-17 loss to san diego last sunday. mcelroy and head trainer john mellody then went to ryan to tell the coach the news. offensive coordinator tony sparano said he was \"pretty silent\" when he found out a few minutes after ryan. \"it's another bump in the road here,\" sparano said, \"and it's something we've become a little accustomed to dealing with.\" ryan was not certain exactly when mcelroy suffered the concussion, but said there was no way he would play mcelroy against the bills and the third-stringer will \"definitely be out.\" mcelroy had been listed on the injury report wednesday with a mild abdominal strain, but was a full participant in practice and was expected to play without any issues. \"i admire his courage and everything else, but you have to be truthful and i think that's the lesson learned here with the medical staff,\" said ryan, who spoke to the entire team about concussions after practice. \"the fact he really wanted to play, i understand the competitive side of greg and all that, but the most important thing is the health of the players.\" obviously, i feel fortunate that something like this showed up without him going out there and putting himself in harm's way. \"while <mark>sanchez</mark> wouldn't comment on whether players choosing to play through head injuries is common in the nfl, tebow acknowledged that it probably does happen around the league because of job security.\" you fight hard to earn something and you don't want to jeopardize that with an injury, for sure, \"said tebow, who added that he has never been in mcelroy's situation.\" i think that's definitely something guys will think about. \"ryan chose to start <mark>sanchez</mark> over tim tebow because the team has just two practices and a walkthrough to prepare before the game. he also cited <mark>sanchez</mark>'s success against the bills in the season opener, when he threw three touchdown passes in the jets' 48-28 win. <mark>sanchez</mark> appeared to be on his way to a solid season, but it ended up being his best game. he was benched for the first time in his four-year career after turning over the ball five times at tennessee on dec. 17.\" i'm excited to play, obviously, \"<mark>sanchez</mark> said.\" you just never want to see something like that happen to a teammate, somebody i really respect. you feel for greg and i'll be ready to play. \"<mark>sanchez</mark> was a bit surprised when ryan told him he'd be starting because he thought mcelroy just wasn't feeling well.\" i guess i didn't expect it, \"<mark>sanchez</mark> said.\" i wasn't coming into today thinking he had a concussion. i never would've known. \"mcelroy leapfrogged tebow on the depth chart to start against the chargers. after finding out about mcelroy's condition, ryan spoke with both <mark>sanchez</mark> and tebow to tell them of his decision.\" obviously, tim's not happy with that, as you'd expect, \"ryan said. the news came on the heels of some tension between ryan and tebow last week, when the popular backup quarterback told the coach he was\" disappointed \"at not getting the start and wanted to play\" regular quarterback. \"espn new york first reported sunday that tebow asked out of the wildcat, and a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed that to the associated press. the two met again last friday to clear the air, and tebow reiterated that he was willing to do anything the team asked him to do. tebow insisted wednesday that he did not refuse to do anything and acknowledged that ryan might have misinterpreted what he said. ryan said he understands that tebow is frustrated at the situation and by not starting, but again would not disclose anything said between the two in their conversations last week. tebow said he didn't think ryan's choice to play <mark>sanchez</mark> was in any way punitive, and added that he and the coach have a\" great \"relationship.\" when you're a competitor, you want to play, \"tebow said.\" but i understood his decision and i just let him know, just like always, that i'll do whatever i can to help the team. \"tebow will be the no. 2 quarterback on sunday at buffalo, and could play - but it won't be as the starter.\" obviously, he'd like a shot at it, \"ryan said,\" but with the situation the way it is, it's a short window, really, to get the preparation time in and i just think it's best for our football team. \"with the way the season has played out, from the quarterback controversies to the injuries suffered by key players, ryan was asked if this is the strangest year he has ever experienced in the nfl. concussion will sideline mcelroy; <mark>sanchez</mark> to start rex ryan stepped to the podium, looked out at the cameras and opened his news conference with a warning.\" you're not going to believe this one,' the jets coach declared without any hint of a smile. firefighters battle surf city blaze that destroys vacant summer home become a subscriber today to enjoy these benefits: ipad-optimized edition mobile site & iphone app are you currently a subscriber? set up your digital access now. you now have full access. thank you for subscribing. access the tablet-optimized site, mobile site and iphone app share your access with any friend or family member subscriber exclusive top 5 daily email newsletter create an account or if you have a digital profile to continue using your current web browser, adobe flash must be installed or upgraded:"}, {"articleID": "2013102308_00037822_W", "names": {"James Lee": ["Q11309421", "Q16221020", "Q3161221", "Q3161260", "Q42790671", "Q56152921", "Q56597623", "Q6137920", "Q6137925", "Q6137927", "Q6137929", "Q8988115"]}, "date": "2013-10-23", "url": "http://www.modbee.com/2013/10/22/2988551/former-broker-admits-defrauding.html#storylink=rss", "content": "FRESNO - The former owner of a Modesto real estate firm pleaded guilty Monday to seven fraud charges in a deal expected to bring eight years in federal prison. <mark>James Lee</mark> Lankford, 74, who previously owned Century 21-Apollo Realty, signed the plea agreement in late August, but illness delayed a formal resolution until this week. He will be sentenced Jan. 27 by U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii, who will decide the appropriate prison term. Lankford's mortgage scheme duped elderly homeowners from Modesto and Hughson and lenders over an 11-year period, costing them more than $7 million. \"Such fraudulent behavior will not go undetected nor will it go unpunished,\" said Michael P. Stephens, acting inspector general for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. \"We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to dismantle such schemes and hold all involved accountable.\" The agency cooperated on the case with the Stanislaus County district attorney's real estate fraud unit and the FBI. Lankford's husband, Jon Vance Lankford, who formerly went by the last name McDade, on Sept. 16 pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud in connection with the scheme and is expected to receive a one-day prison sentence.
