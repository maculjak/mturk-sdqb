similar counties. to find a pantry close to you, call (740) 344-7401 or contact a nonprofit such as 211 or the united way. food points breakdown? cash: 10 points for every dollar? priority items: 5 points for canned meats, pancake mix, syrup, diapers and spaghetti sauce? most critical: 4 points for canned fruits, box helpers, juice and personal care items? important items: 2 points for muffin mix, pasta, canned or dried beans, tuna, macaroni and cheese, and soup? needed items: 1 point for everything else newark - forty teams of people raced through simulated market aisles saturday as part of the supermarket sweep event at indian mound mall. supermarket sweep is the kickoff event for operation feed, the annual fundraiser for the food pantry network of licking county. four teams from both boeing and tamarack farms dairy competed, a record number for the event. although the economy is beginning to stabilize, a great need for food for those in need exists, said <mark>chuck moore</mark>, executive director of the network. in 2010, the network served 168,000 individuals, more than 820,000 meals and 32,000 families - a total of 1.9 million pounds of food. that represents a 1.3 percent increase from the need in 2009, but that is a very small increase compared to the 20 percent and 25 percent the network had experienced in the previous few years. \"we have seen a leveling off (in requests for food),\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"we are very optimistic that if we can sustain what we raised last year, that will get us through this year .\" the food and money collected for operation feed in 2010 earned 2.4 million food points, so that will be the goal again for 2011. the 2011 chairman is bob knoesel, a longtime board member for the network. \"the operation feed campaign generates approximately 70 percent of the funding and food needed annually by the food pantry network,\" knoesel said. \"this is a huge undertaking and would not be possible without the very generous support of individuals and organizations throughout the county who give so willingly of their own food resources, time, talent and money .\" the rest, or 30 percent, is collected from local donations such as churches and organizations that raise money and food throughout the year. in 2010, 115 companies, churches and groups participated in the friendly competition of operation feed. at this point, 100 organizations have signed up for 2011, <mark>moore</mark> said. \"we are optimistic we will hit the 115 mark,\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"there is always a lot of competition between schools and organizations. last year, lmh was the overall winner, and it's usually state farm .\" cash donations receive the most food points. <mark>moore</mark> said the network is able to purchase food at remarkably low prices because of its collaboration with the mid-ohio food bank. a 16-ounce box of cereal at the supermarket might cost anywhere from $2.50 to $5, but it can be purchased for just 4 cents from the food bank. \"that is why money is the most valuable to us,\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"it allows us to purchase the items we need when we need them .\" again this year, the operation feed campaign will be teamed up with the feinstein foundation. the network will get a share of $1 million equal to the proportion of the total amount raised by all participating organizations.

working to hone secondary pitches tampa, fla.--phillies left-hander cole hamels has reached another level in his spring training preparations. early in his career, hamels used the spring to build arm strength and establish his fastball and changeup. it worked through 2008, when he earned world series most valuable player honors. but after a subpar 2009 season, hamels reemphasized his offseason conditioning program and entered spring training '10 in excellent shape. he no longer needed to emphasize building arm strength, which allowed him to work on improving his cutter and curveball. this spring is a little different than last. hamels is in excellent shape again, but instead of developing his cutter and changeup, he is trying to fine-tune them. \"it's a lot nicer learning how to pitch and knowing how to pitch,\" hamels said after tossing two innings on saturday in a 5-4 victory over the new york yankees in both clubs' grapefruit league opener at george m. steinbrenner field. \"that's kind of what it takes to get to that next level--knowing how to attack certain hitters. that's something that, when you have those pitches and have them down, you can do a lot .\" if i can throw all four right now and work it all the way through spring, i should have them perfected by the season. that's something i don't think i've done as much in past seasons. it was just trying to establish a fastball and changeup, and then the other pitches kind of came. i think i was a little too late sometimes in the first part of the season. that's what i'm trying to take away, is being in season form and ready to go from the first game on. \"hamels allowed one hit, one unearned run and one walk over two innings on saturday. he struck out two and hit a batter .\" it was good, \"hamels said .\" just being able to get out there and do the up-down [between innings], that's something that is really hard to simulate. getting the hitters in there, the game rolling, sitting down and getting back up to have to ramp it up again, that's the part you have to get used to. it's fun. any time games start, it's a lot better than the practices. \"hamels is trying to work more on his cutter, which he essentially started throwing from scratch last spring .\" unfortunately, they weren't working too well [on saturday], \"hamels said .\" they were going down in the dirt. \"tickets but hamels expects the pitch to be a weapon again this season .\" i know how to pitch with it, and i think that's going to help, knowing when to throw it to certain hitters, \"hamels said,\" and also, trying to move it to both sides of the plate. i didn't really do it too much last year because it was something new. but watching cliff [lee] and \"doc' [halladay], those guys can go both to sides of the plate, and it's definitely helped them out, so that's something i'm definitely trying to establish .\" teammates and coaches have remarked on hamels' condition this spring. they seem particularly impressed, even after he looked so good last spring. \"i took the same approach i had last year in getting into the best shape i could,\" hamels said. \"that's what i've been able to do .\" hamels went just 12-11 last season, despite posting a 3.06 era. he seems primed for a big year in a rotation that could include a few big years. hamels has come a long way since he struck out derek jeter, <mark>alex rodriguez</mark> and <mark>tony clark</mark> in a hyped spring training appearance in 2004. \"then, i didn't know what the heck i was doing, so good things happened,\" hamels said with a smile. \"now, i'm just coming in and just trying to get my work in ....i guess you could say i'm more intelligent, in better shape [since facing the yankees in 2004].\" that was pretty much deer in the headlights, not knowing where you are or what you're doing and letting your talent take over. here, i know i have certain things i need to accomplish--goals for spring training--and i'm just trying to get into shape, because everything matters during the season, not in spring training. \"todd zolecki is a reporter for mlb.com. this story was not subject to the approval of major league

"<mark>chris</mark> balas thewolverine.com senior editor the fort michigan freshman tim hardaway jr. earned his third straight big ten freshman of the week award after leading michigan to a key road win over minnesota, but yahoo.com gave its conference freshman of the year honor to another frosh - and not ohio state's jared sullinger. sullinger earned yahoo.com's conference player of the year award after averaging 17.4 points and 9.8 rebounds per game for the no. 1 buckeyes (27-2), with u-m sophomore darius morris earning second-team honors. instead of awarding the freshman of the year to sullinger, as well, yahoo gave it to ohio state point guard aaron craft. craft has been, without question, a key player on ohio state's run to the top of the ncaa heap, averaging 7.1 points and 4.6 points per game while shooting 38.6 percent from three-point range. in addition to winning freshman of the week honors four times, though, hardaway has:? averaged 13.6 points per game overall and 14.6 in big ten play (a remarkable 20.8 in his last five).? shot 44.9 percent from three-point range in big ten play, 46.4 percent overall, and grabbed 3.9 rebounds per game .? shot 60 percent from long range in his last five games to help keep the wolverines in the hunt for an ncaa tournament berth when most picked them among the league's bottom two teams. hardaway averaged 19.0 points. 3.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals per game, shooting 54.2 percent from the field (13-for-24) and 60.0 percent from three-point range (9-for-15) against wisconsin and minnesota to earn player of the week honors. he knocked down five triples in the first half of a 70-63 win at minnesota, and his putback with less than three minutes to go and three big free throws in the closing seconds helped u-m seal its fourth road win in the big ten hardaway has scored in double figures in his last 11 games - leading u-m in seven of those games - and has 22 double-digit games overall this season, and there's still a game to play saturday vs. michigan state (begging the question - why release an all-big ten team now, anyway?). **** will michigan make the field of 68? the wolverines are only listed on 10 of 28 brackets at this point, but that's likely to change if the wolverines beat michigan state saturday (in a contest that's sold out and, the athletic department has declared, a maize out, meaning u-m fans are expected to wear their maize to the 2:00 (cbs tv) game). a victory means the wolverines will likely finish in a three - or four-way tie for fourth place in the big ten depending on what happens with the following teams: illinois: the illini seem headed for a 9-9 finish, standing 8-8 with games on tap at purdue (tuesday) and home to indiana saturday. michigan state: the spartans (8-8) host iowa for senior night wednesday before traveling to ann arbor saturday. penn state: psu (8-8) has been good at home but gets a huge test tonight against ohio state before traveling to minnesota sunday. if all four teams finish 9-9, the wolverines earn the no. 4 seed by virtue of the tiebreaker (overall record against the others tied with them). u-m would hold a 4-1 record against the other three. if penn state were to lose two, illinois would be the four seed and u-m five. either way, a victory (and at least one psu loss) assures the wolverines of a first-round bye and a friday big ten tournament game the following week. a loss to the spartans and u-m would be playing on thursday, but bracketology 101 believes michigan can secure a bid. \"michigan made the cut, despite their loss at home to wisconsin on wednesday, because we think they have a decent chance to beat michigan state at home this weekend and then win their first big ten tourney game,\" they wrote. **** in other basketball news, former michigan great cazzie russell (1964-66) earned a place in the national collegiate basketball hall of fame, the national association of basketball coaches

a sophomore and again as a junior, when u-m finished as national runner-up to ucla. russell was named national player of the year as a senior, when he averaged 30.8 points per game, and helped michigan to the elite eight. \"i stayed up the night before [my last game] thinking i've been here four years, all this is about to end and then i'm going to have to face the world,\" russell told the wolverine back in 2006. \"it was a great, great opportunity for me as a young man to have gone to a great institution like michigan. no matter what anybody says, nobody will ever take that away from

need to up our game? alixpartners director <mark>dan murphy</mark> is not convinced that consumers expect or demand high-end customer service in all the stores they visit. most consumers who appreciate the value benefits of aldi or primark understand perfectly well the trade-offs between lower prices and customer service levels. everyone understands the easyjet/ryanair price and service model. \"there is far less stigma attached to the value players now,\" he adds. \"a few years ago, their customers were mainly low income families, but now it is common to spot bmws and mercedes in their car parks .\" his view is that it is unrealistic to expect all retailers to deliver some basic minimum standard of individual customer service, as mary portas seems to suggest. while many retailers do talk about putting customers at the heart of their business, in reality they are mostly interested in sales and profits. as customer service levels are very difficult to measure, the most common proxy for these are financial results. as long as primark continues to outperform the sector despite relatively low levels of customer service, why should it change? household disposable income continues to fall and unemployment remains a major issue, particularly among the younger age groups with 20% of 16 - to 24-year-olds out of work. \"retailers must keep this in mind when considering the relationship between higher service levels and prices at the checkout,\" he says. \"i don't see things getting better any time soon, and so inevitably consumers are going to be looking for more

i don't care what happens, the blues is gonna be here,\" said sumlin, 79, with a mischievous laugh. \"everything else is gonna die before the blues .\" hearing sumlin play--be it on old howlin' wolf recordings, his performances last year on a jimi hendrix tribute tour, or with the big head blues club--it's tempting to believe him. and when mohr reports that 95-year-old honeyboy edwards is a fixture on the tour bus, and that sumlin constantly regales him with stories from the road and has \"been like a father to me,\" that passing of the baton seems a bit more secure. sure, sumlin is engaging in howler-caliber hype when he insists that \"these big head todd and his monsters can play <mark>robert johnson</mark> as good as <mark>robert johnson</mark> hisself .\" but when mohr opens the gigs with a heartfelt acoustic rendition of \"love in vain\" or \"stones in my passway\" on dobro or guitar and vocal, it's apparent he's following the tradition while being true to himself and ever-conscious of the danger of becoming a charlatan. the same can be said of the other three members of big head todd and the monsters. ditto drummer cedric burnside, grandson of the late blues singer r.l. burnside and the 2010 blues music awards drummer of the year, who teams with slide guitarist lightnin' malcolm on the record and the current tour. that's malcolm stinging his slide behind honeyboy edwards, or on a solo rendition of a son house tune. without question, something precious will be lost with the passing of edwards, perkins, sumlin and others. but it has always been that way. meanwhile, something precious is also being savored, and retained. \"i told my producer, clive goldsmith, that i've been waiting 30 years to make this record,\" said mohr, who had a hit single when he and the monsters were joined by <mark>john lee</mark> hooker for a cover of hooker's classic blues \"boom boom,\" and who included the blues standard \"smokestack lightning\" on their last album in 2010. \"i am delighted to be in this period of rediscovery and enlightenment. the music i make [from now on] will always be affected by this. - the garfunkel-less hall of famer will perform at the minneapolis convention center's auditorium in lieu of northrop. your comment is being reviewed for inclusion on the site. startribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics. commenters must follow our terms of use. keep it civil and stay on topic. no profanity, vulgarity, racial slurs or personal attacks. comments that violate the above will be removed. repeat violators may lose their commenting privileges on startribune.com. car detective let us look for you. when a vehicle that matches your specifications is listed, search thousands of listings nationwide. listings include local foreclosures and upcoming open houses. healthcare careers exploration. education. your healthcare career awaits.", "articleID": "2011030323_00080782_W", "names": {"John Lee": ["Q1306769", "Q14946953", "Q16228054", "Q1700807", "Q18817097", "Q19325486", "Q19840337", "Q24583501", "Q28919977", "Q54556034", "Q54556035", "Q54556036", "Q56191613", "Q58155059", "Q59595679", "Q6244365", "Q6244371", "Q6244377", "Q6244380", "Q6244381", "Q6244383", "Q8995719", "Q9051824"]}}]
