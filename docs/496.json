A save by goalkeeper Olivia Barnhill in the fifth round ended the game and made <mark>Brown</mark> a Division III national champion for the third time. \"That moment was pretty surreal, I pretty much just broke down in tears, just so happy and overwhelmed,\" she said. \"When I saw my family in the stands I got even more emotional, they've been the rocks throughout my career .\" <mark>Lauren Brown</mark> (middle) with her brother and sister both dressed in cow suits (the Ephs mascot is a purple cow) after winning her third national title with Williams College. <mark>Brown</mark> was a reserve midfielder her first season, making only five appearances during the first national title run, but became a regular her sophomore season when the team lost in the national final to Messiah and played every game of her junior and senior seasons. The only other losses during her time in Massachusetts all came against Middlebury, including a 1-0 loss in the conference championship in November. \"Being able to play Middlebury in the final was a big send off,\" she said. Some key injuries threatened to derail the team's journey back to the final this year, but that was where the experience of <mark>Brown</mark> and her six classmates came into play, leading the team back to the pinnacle of college soccer. The senior class ended their time at Williams with an 80-4-9 record. \"This year was pretty much the best and most difficult year of my career,\" <mark>Brown</mark> said. \"Difficult in that we had plenty of injuries and because of that had to change up our lineup a lot and deal with some small dynamic issues because of that. There were really just problem solving pieces along the whole way and I definitely at times thought\" wow, it's going to take a lot for us to get back there. \"' The lone player from the Philadelphia area on the squad, <mark>Brown</mark>'s soccer journey is one with deep ties on both sides of the Delaware River. She started out playing for Indian Mills Soccer Club in New Jersey with her dad, <mark>Ken Brown</mark>, as one of her coaches and later played for Millville SC and FC Bucks while also participating in the New Jersey Olympic Development Program. She starred at Pennington School in high school, where she was on teams that won three state championships. She credits her dad, who played at Lehigh University in the early\" 90s, with passing on his love of the game and her whole family for the many sacrifices made and the long hours commuting to training--about 90 minutes to training with FC Bucks twice a week and games on weekends when they still lived in Shamong. \"He tried having a soccer ball at our feet when we were young,\" <mark>Brown</mark> said of her dad. \"But both my parents and my entire family have been so supportive; they watch every one of my games, are the first to text me or call me after each game and my dad and siblings were able to come down to UNCG for the final four, which was an amazing experience .\" <mark>Ken Brown</mark> experienced a wide range of emotions himself the night of the final. \"The range of emotions was unbelievable, from sadness knowing her career was coming to a end, to nervousness over her last collegiate game coming down to PKs for a national championship, to complete joy that I got to experience such a wonderful ride from an amazing career,\" <mark>Ken Brown</mark> said. He was also relieved because of some nagging injuries his daughter has dealt with over her time in college. \"For the last four years (she) has endured a blood circulatory issue, tendonitis in both Achilles and shin splints,\" he said. \"Lu had to rehab before every practice and game for her entire collegiate career so she could play for her coach and teammates at Williams .\" She already has a job as a quantitative data analyst lined up in Boston when she graduates in May so with soccer over now her focus has shifted to finishing out her final semester. Looking back on her successful playing career that ended the way so many players can only dream, she said she'll have way more than just the three national titles to cherish. \"Even beyond all this success there's these lifelong relationships I've been able to cultivate,\" she said. \"I'm really just so so thankful but also sad that I can't be on this journey anymore with this second family I've been able to have here at Williams .\" More From Brotherly Game", "articleID": "2018122519_00098526_W", "names": {"Lauren Brown": ["Q16210053", "Q22277187", "Q28950112", "Q53214450"]}}, {"date": "2018-12-26", "url": "http://kvia.com/news/us-world/beijing-puts-human-rights-lawyer-on-trial-day-after-christmas/951152089", "content": "KVIA Beijing puts human rights lawyer on trial day after Christmas Wang Quanzhang prominent defender of religion By: LILY LEE AND BEN WESTCOTT, CNN Posted: Dec 25, 2018 08:24 PM MST Updated: Dec 25, 2018 09:09 PM MST Hong Kong former lawmaker Emily Lau holds a sign of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang in Hong Kong in April 2018. Isaac Lawrence/AFP/Getty Images via CNN Hong Kong former lawmaker Emily Lau holds a sign of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang in Hong Kong in April 2018. Related Content Prosecutors weigh sex assault charges against Chinese billionaire (CNN) - A high-profile Chinese human rights lawyer detained more than three years ago is facing trial Wednesday, the latest prominent detainee sent to court by the ruling Communist Party over the Christmas period. Wang Quanzhang was taken into custody in July 2015, one of more than 200 lawyers and activists detained as part of a mass crackdown on human rights defenders across China. Wang, known for his advocacy of practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement and Christians, is the last lawyer still behind bars as part of the sweep. China regularly sends high-profile detainees and dissidents to court around the Christmas period, taking advantage of the large absence of the international media and diplomatic community. Human rights activist <mark>Wu Gan</mark> was sentenced to eight years in prison on Christmas Day in 2017, while Nobel Laureate <mark>Liu Xiaobo</mark> was imprisoned on the same day in 2009. Wang's trial began on Wednesday morning local time, and is being held behind closed doors due to the nature of the charges. It isn't clear how long the trial will last or when the final sentence will be handed down. Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, has been campaigning relentlessly for his release ever since her husband's detention. In April she marched from Beijing to Tianjin on foot to \"find her husband .\" She was one of four spouses of high-profile human rights lawyers who protested against their detention in front of the Supreme People's Court on December 17, publicly shaving their heads in protest as the word \"hairlessness\" sounds similar to \"lawlessness\" in Chinese. Due to the tight control of China's authoritarian government and harsh penalties for protesting, public demonstrations in China over politically sensitive topics are rare. After security guards stopped her from presenting a letter petitioning for her husband, Li said judges had behaved in a \"lawless\" manner around Wang's trial. \"It has been almost two years since the case of Wang Quanzhang was filed to the court, but the judges in charge of this case have been avoiding meeting us, and our lawyer is not allowed to see the court paper,\" she said at the protest. \"This case has been endlessly delayed...so I came here today to ask the Supreme Court to fulfill its responsibility of supervising and to correct the subordinate court's unlawful behaviors .\" Li was also visited by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during her last visit to China in May.
