[4] aang's crush on her was made explicit, while katara was told she will marry a powerful bender and had the appearance of an epiphany when sokka casually described aang as a powerful bender. crystal catacombs, his earthly attachment to katara prevented him from triggering the avatar state. after being shot down by azula and being revived by katara's spirit water, aang looked up at katara and smiled at her weakly, indicating that he had not truly given her up. invasion of the fire nation, aang kissed katara on the lips before leaving to find and battle fire lord ozai. [8] despite this, the two were not a couple; katara even refused aang's romantic advances during an intermission of the [9] however, they kissed passionately at the end of the series, [10] beginning a romantic relationship. it has been proven that aang and katara married in their later lives and had three children, including two sons by the names of katara and zuko - known as \"zutara conflict at tu zin, katara offered to help zuko heal his uncle's wound. [12] zuko and katara later happened to both be imprisoned in the same [14] she was able to forgive and start trusting him. soon after, they slowly became friends. when it was time for everyone to choose their own destiny, zuko enlisted katara's aid in facing azula. zuko actually saved katara's life by jumping in the way of azula's lighting bolt that was targeted for her. [16] their relationship never turned romantic. sokka and ty lee - known as\" ty lokka sokka at several points in the story. when she first met him, she commented to mai that he was \"kind of cute\". [12] when she met him a second time, she happily exclaimed, \"it is the avatar...and friends!\" with a special emphasis on sokka. kyoshi warriors, ty lee fought sokka in a fashion that prompted her to say, \"it's like we're dancing together!\" sokka pointed out that he was \"kind of involved with suki\". mai's smile at the thought of seeing zuko again, [18] maiko was one of the primary ships of the show. the two were childhood sweethearts, ember island that mai and zuko had trouble with one another's anger or apathy and split up. [8] mai interpreted this as him breaking up with her and, in a later confrontation, stated he had broken her heart. despite this, she betrayed azula to save him, saying, \"[23] moments before zuko's coronation, they reaffirmed their relationship with a hug and a kiss. jet and katara - known as\" jetara [24] however, when jet tricked katara into harming innocent people, she abandoned all loyalty to him and remained bitter toward him from then on. however, katara seemed uncomfortable and defensive when questioned about her relationship with him in ba sing se, and apparently considered jet her ex-boyfriend. any remaining chance of them becoming a couple was eliminated when jet died under long feng. [25] interestingly, jetara was commonly supported as a prelude to zutara, as it was claimed to be proof that katara liked \"bad boys\". it was also revealed on avatar extras that jet was katara's first kiss, though it was off screen. aang and toph - known as \"taang toph and aang had a close friendship throughout the series, although as actor sokka said, they had a\" rocky relationship \". [26] but did not meet toph until he, katara and sokka bought tickets to attend the earth rumble vi tournament. toph initially refused to join their group, but agreed when her father expressed his desire to hide and protect her even more. [27] proponents of the ship liked their nature as opposites. sokka and toph - known as\" tokka \", fans known as\" tokkans \"or, more commonly,\" tokkaneers \"- this ship was mostly based on the pair's deep friendship and, later on, toph's clear crush on sokka. explicit hints about her feelings for him began when toph was bitter about how he ran straight to suki instead of thanking her for saving his life. later on, when toph was drowning, sokka announced his intention to save her, only for suki to reach her first. toph, believing sokka rescued her, kissed suki on the cheek. [7] their friendship was later emphasized even more when toph blushed upon sokka's return from training with [31] later, they had a tender conversation when she had a falling out with katara. [29] during the final battle, sokka and toph worked together, at first with [16] after suki saved both of their lives, sokka remained in his relationship with suki. tokka was commonly shipped in tandem with kataang, as it provided romantic partners for all four members of team avatar. many tokka shippers\" abandoned ship \"after it was revealed that toph's daughter dated katara's son, as this would have meant the two would be cousins if sokka was lin's father. [32] toph and zuko - known as\" toko \"- toph was the first member of the group to accept zuko, encouraging the others to let him join team avatar. [13] they had a tender conversation, where zuko expressed concern about his actions toward [12] that he had probably already forgiven his nephew. when the team temporarily separated in an attempt to track down aang, toph immediately chose to accompany zuko, claiming that everyone else had gone on a\" life-changing field trip with zuko \", and it was therefore her turn. she clung to zuko's arm, causing him to blush. [33] their friendship made for a convenient fanon ship, as the complete team avatar (aang, katara, sokka, toph, zuko, suki) can be paired off among themselves as kataang, sukka, and toko. it should also be noted that toph stopped blushing about sokka around the same time zuko showed up, and hit his arm constantly, her way of showing affection. [9] any problems between the two usually resolved quickly, including the time zuko burned her feet. yue and sokka - known as\" yukka [36] she came to love him, too, but the two were kept apart due to yue's engagement to another warrior, [37] yue ultimately died when she gave up her life force to save the moon spirit tui, and was thus reincarnated as tui's successor. yue kissed sokka goodbye, promising she would always be with him. [38] sokka remained very upset about yue's sacrifice, believing he failed to protect her. [30] although he had since fallen in love with suki, sokka's love for yue remained very strong. [39] haru and katara - known as \"haru and katara was suggested after katara met haru in the forest near the mining village. when haru was arrested by the fire nation, katara tricked the fire nation into arresting her in order to save him, a task in which she succeeded. she and haru grew close after they confided their personal sadness due to the ongoing war to each other. [40] haru and katara have since remained good friends and fought by each other's side during the sokka and suki - known as\" ' sukka suki and sokka's relationship began when they first met each other on kyoshi warriors. however, suki showed him the error of his ways. she later kissed him on the cheek before he left kyoshi island. full moon bay, although there were some awkward moments for them. however, they parted again after sharing a passionate kiss. [30] suki was captured by mai, azula and ty lee shortly after, [42] so they did not meet again until sokka ventured the [43] later on, the two planned a romantic rendezvous in sokka's tent; however, it was comically interrupted when zuko approached sokka for advice on dealing with katara. [33] azula and ty lee - known as \"tyzula\" , this is a fairly popular ship. ty lee frequently compliments azula, and many fans feel that azula has a soft spot for ty lee, as demonstrated in \"the beach\". they state that ty lee's betrayal was what sent azula over the edge, and despite ty lee's betrayal at the boiling rock, this remains a popular ship, arguably more popular than any other ship involving either girl in avatar: the last airbender. song and zuko - known as \"zong\" - this short-lived ship came up after an jin and zuko - known as \"jinko ba sing se, displayed an open attraction to zuko and eventually earned a date with him at iroh's insistence. zuko denied that jin was his girlfriend, but he enjoyed his date more than he wanted anyone to know. zuko and jin even shared a kiss before zuko realized that their relationship would never work out, leaving her somewhat saddened. zuko later admitted to iroh that his date was\" nice \". [45] jin and zuko met again, but by this point, zuko was back with his childhood sweetheart, mai. [46] suki and zuko - known as\" makorra \", fans known as\" makorrians \"- this wildly popular the legend of korra ship was inspired well before the series debuted. when korra and mako first encountered, [47] makorra hints were present, causing the shipping to peak. the ship went viral once a promotional trailer showed a shot of korra kissing mako. although their relationship is still fairly undeveloped, the ship supporters continue to grow in numbers based on the various teasings of the couple. ikki and jinora explicitly state the fact that korra has a crush on mako, the two involuntarily fall asleep on each other at republic city park, and when the two pose as a couple to infiltrate amon's rally to save [48] in fact, mako's scarf has been a center argument for many fans, claiming it is similar to the\" red string of fate \", an idea in eastern mythology that the god's might tie two lover's fates together with a red string so that they will meet and never separate. furthermore, korra is revealed to be jealous of asami and mako's budding relationship. [49] when korra admitted her feelings to mako, he initially shot her down, but after witnessing her going on a date with bolin, mako expressed feelings of jealousy. when korra then kissed him by surprise, he willingly kissed her back, complicating his relationship with asami and his brother. [50] mako continues having an interest in korra's welfare, as he was the first to hug her after she faced off against some equalist factory when he could have carried lin or tenzin as well, but left them for his brother. borra\" or \"kolin\" - this ship has a lot of fans that would like to see korra and bolin have a non-platonic relationship. bolin convinced toza to let korra pass by after she snuck into the pro-bending arena, and invited her back to the pro-bending teams' locker room to watch the match. the two soon became friends, he willingly showed her some pro-bending tricks and was quick to accept her on the [48] bolin thanked her by giving her a cupcake and a rose. his little gesture of kindness was overshadowed by the large gift basket the. bolin immediately inquired whether or not that \"tarrlok guy\" was bothering korra, as he was willing to have a word with him. when korra laughed it off, saying that tarrlok was just \"some old guy\" , bolin expressed joy upon hearing this, stating \"that sounds better, i like that better\". [49] soon after, bolin talked to mako about korra being his future girlfriend, saying that he and korra would be perfect for each other. although mako was against it, bolin asked korra out, and took her to narook's seaweed noodlery for their \"date\". they ate dinner, had fun, and took a trip to republic city's tower to gaze out over the city's skyline. bolin bought korra a bouquet of flowers the next day, but witnessed her kissing mako, which reduced him to tears. masami \"or\" mami \"- this ship began when asami accidentally hit mako with her moped, introducing the two. upon laying eyes on her, mako was smitten by asami's beauty. to make up for the accident, asami asked him on a date to kuang's cuisine, at which asami holds mako's hand. at tarrlok's gala, the two go as a couple and asami is seen consistently holding mako's arm. later on, the two ride in a taxi cab through republic city park where they express their emotions, eventually leading to the two cuddling. [49] mako and asami are currently going steady, leaving korra to be\" the other woman \". [50] given that this ship is a strong threat due to the two officially dating, there is always the chance for a shipping war similar to kataang/zutara of the series prior. mako was willing to threaten his friendship with korra when she insisted on going after asami's father, immediately choosing asami over korra. he also cares deeply for asami's safety and is very protective over her, venturing down a possibly dangerous road in her place to find out information for her. tahorra\" or \"tahnorra\" - this ship began when a promo was released revealing tahno and korra standing in close quarters. during this interaction, korra challenged him to a fight, calling him \"pretty boy\" , and then the wolfbats' waterbender uttered: \"go for it\". this first interaction occurred while the avatar was on a date with bolin, when korra saw that tahno was staring at them. tahno walked over to her and offered her pro-bending \"private lessons\". this single scene resulted in a constantly expanding fandom. [50] korra and tahno also interacted when tahno was at the \"bosami\" - this undeveloped ship is occasionally promoted by makorra advocates, conveniently pairing asami with bolin to solve asami's love interest in mako and bolin's love interest in korra. makorra advocates also use it to ship the new team avatar as makorra and bosami. the two have interacted infrequently, but bolin enjoyed living in asami's mansion after the closing of the [51] he also seems to trust asami with pabu, as she was seen holding pabu when mako and bolin are preparing to move out of the arena. in search of korra, bolin told asami about mako's true love, revealing korra and mako's first kiss. days later, bolin aided asami to defeat <mark>hiroshi sato</mark> by sending earth boulders to <mark>hiroshi sato</mark>'s mecha tank. [52] iroh and korra - known as \"iroh debuted, but before he and korra even met, masami fans and fans strongly against makorra started shipping korra with iroh. after iroh receives word that republic city is under attack, iroh states that he\" look [s] forward to winning back republic city, together. \"[53] later, when iroh's fleets were approaching the city, he was attacked, and fell in the water. korra saved him and brought him to team avatar's hideout, and used waterbending to heal his wounds. iroh was at first against the idea of korra leaving to fight amon, but decided that his grandfather, zuko, would value the avatar's opinion, so he should too. [54] iroh and asami - known as\" irosami \"or\" asaroh \"- as with korroh, this ship began before iroh and asami met by makorra shippers who did not like bosami. the pair barely interacted during their time together in the series. they first met after korra brought iroh to team avatar's hideout. after korra and mako left to fight amon, iroh and asami, along with bolin, naga, and pabu, went to attack the equalist's airfield, but were captured by <mark>hiroshi</mark>. after naga freed them, iroh split up with the group in an equalist airplane to destroy other airplanes. [54] korra and asami - known as\" \"pemzin\" - pema and tenzin are happily married with three kids, with their fourth child being born during the series. fans have expressed shock over the sixteen year age difference between them, but that has not stopped people from enjoying and celebrating their relationship. tenzin and lin beifong - known as \"linzin\" or \"tenlin\" - as the son of the avatar and the daughter of one of his good friends, they have known each other since childhood. they were once romantically involved, but began to drift apart due to \"different goals in life\". pema told korra that she could not watch tenzin spend his life with \"the wrong woman\". [50] tenzin broke up with lin after pema confessed her love for him. however, there is still lots of friction between the chief and the airbender. korra even suggested that lin has still not gotten over what happened. lin agreed to tenzin's request to be lenient with korra when she destroyed some shops in republic city, and promised to act with more decorum during the pro-bending tournament championship when he asked her. [32] furthermore, lin was very willing to help out her old boyfriend out by protecting his family whilst he went to an urgent council meeting, and even put her life and bending on the line in order to buy tenzin and his family time from the pursuing equalists. edit fans often had a \"fan preferred couple\" which they attempted to find reasons to substantiate as well as reasons to disregard other possible matches with these characters. some fans even designated a pairing which they defended fervently. fanon was written extensively; forums were filled with \"shipping\" theories and rumors. this often resulted in conflicts between conflicting \"shippings\" , the most well-known example being between \"kataang\" and \"zutara\". supporters on both sides became increasingly antagonistic to the other \"ship\" and theories extended beyond how their \"ship\" was correct to how the other \"ship\" was incorrect. often, shippers would cite how one member of the opposing ship was or should be romantically attracted to a different person. typically kataangers would cite zuko and mai's relationship, while zutarians began shipping toph with aang to deal with the problem of the hero being unattached. because the correct \"ships\" remained unrevealed throughout most of the show, fans constantly debated their preferred \"ships\". at one point, the creators, bryan konietzko, said they were inclined to \"kataang\" , but did not say outright that it was correct, noting \"zutara\" as an interesting concept. they also expressed surprise about the concept of \"shipping\". the \"shipping wars\" had a generally negative impact on the avatar fan community. although the correct \"ships\" have now been revealed, there is still an antagonistic feeling among a small number of avatar fans. with the release of legend of korra, the \"shipping wars\" now concern the conflicting ships of this series, particularly \"masami\" and \"makorra\". shipping war i - this shipping war took place during avatar: the last airbender and continued for a few months after the last episode in book 3: fire and mainly revolved around the zutara, maiko, and kataang ships. shipping war ii - this shipping war is ongoing in the legend of korra and mainly revolves around the makorra, masami, and borra ships. shipping conflict - this shipping conflict is ongoing, and has the potential of becoming a full fledged shipping war. it revolves around the tokka/the doph and linzin/pemzin shippings, as well as revival of old zutara, maiko, and kataang hatred. it primarily started when lin lost her bending in this is for those who ship makorra or masami and those who have been hating on mako, korra, or asami, i do not mean to offend anyone this is just my opinion ^ not that i'm homophobic, but your reasoning is a bit of a logical reach there. ^ how is it hateful and homophobic if they simply don't show a homosexual couple. and to clear the air, i'm not homophobic, but if your gonna swing for the other team and flaunt it around, don't do it around me. yes well, some parents don't like their kids watching shows with murder-suicides in them. too bad for those parents. this is a fan webpage, we do not have to censor ourselves for everyone. for those of you who think korrasami should be taken down simply because you believe it to be \"inappropriate,' please stop being so ignorant. yes, we are well aware that nickelodeon would never allow a gay couple to be depicted in their programming, but this list has nothing to do with accuracy and what would most likely happen. there are a fair amount of fans of this ship who believe they have some sort of chemistry, or merely want them together in the romantic sense. while i don't really think it's an appropiate ship (except in terms of\" romantic friendship' rather than lesbianism) i'm inclined to agree that it should stay as the purpose of this page is not to show the ships that will or can happen so much as the pairing that fans ship in general. frankly i find toph and zuko pretty sick (age difference, anyone?). but it's still on here because it is a popular ship with some canon evidence. korrasami should really be a \"make believe ship\" that shouldn't be on the official shipping page, and should just stay in the minds of people who think they should be together...even though they never will be. and ^ age doesn't matter, but they really shouldn't be together anyway, i just don't see it...honestly, i know two kids that where raised by gay couples and they came out completely fine and unscarred. they love their parents, gender doesn't matter to them. it's not going to screw up the kids mind, if anything never showing a gay couple will because they hear about gay couples and don't understand and then wonder why it's not in anything they watch if they hear about it. my sister's step daughter turned to me in the middle of watching arthur and said: \"why aren't there any love between buster and arthur like uncle tommy and uncle richy?\" she's completely and utterly confused as to why none of her favorite shows show a relationship like my brother's and his husband.", "articleID": "2012070213_00087197_W", "names": {"Hiroshi Sato": ["Q1313589", "Q3244916"]}}, {"date": "2012-07-03", "url": "http://celticsblog.com/2012/7/2/3133722/joe-johnson-traded-to-nets-things-just-got-interesting", "content": "browse more photos? \"> after months and months of the indecision with dwight howard the nets decided to cut bait and move on. first they traded for gerald wallace and re-signed him this offseason (for too much money most say). now they have traded all their expiring deals for brooklyn nets agree to trade with atlanta hawks for <mark>joe johnson</mark>, sources say -

three key figures from argentina's \"dirty war\" got hefty jail terms for the systematic theft of babies from political prisoners during the 1976-1983 dictatorship, an argentine court ruled on thursday. the missing children - stolen from their parents and illegally adopted, often by military families - are one of the most painful legacies of the crackdown on leftist dissent in which rights groups say up to 30,000 people were killed. just over 100 of the children have discovered their true identities, but many families are still searching more than three decades later. activists say there could be several hundred more individuals who do not know they were taken as babies from their parents. \"this is what we were seeking. we never wanted revenge, we were never hateful, we didn't ask for anything more than justice and justice has been done,\" an elderly man who identified himself as francisco madariaga's grandfather told local television. the sentences in the case known as \"the systematic plan\" investigated the theft and illegal adoption of 34 of the stolen infants. the 11 defendants included former junta leaders jorge rafael videla, 86, and reynaldo bignone, 84, and ex-navy officer jorge acosta - known as the tiger. they are already serving life sentences for previous human rights convictions. videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison as the architect of the plan, while acosta got 30 years and bignone 15. the other defendants were also ordered to serve sentences of various lengths. videla, who is unrepentant about rights abuses committed by the state, described himself as a \"political prisoner\" during the trial and said any abductions that did take place were not part of a systematic plan. \"the women giving birth, who i respect as mothers, were militants who were active in the machine of terror,\" the former dictator said in his closing remarks. \"many used their unborn children as human shields .\" some of the stolen babies were born to women held at clandestine torture centres. nurses have told how some babies were breast-fed by their mothers for several days, while others were taken away immediately. there were no birth certificates, making the task of identifying them and reuniting them with their parents' relatives painstaking and lengthy. most of the 34 children in the case have been identified. they include pro-government city legislator juan cabandie, now 34, who was born at the infamous esma naval mechanics school when his 16-year-old mother alicia was held there. he was adopted by a policeman and given a new name. another is leftist lawmaker victoria donda, whose parents were also kidnapped and held at the esma before disappearing without trace. others, like clara anahi mariani, are still missing. as a three-month-old infant, she was kidnapped when state security services raided her home in 1976, killing her mother and fellow leftist activists in the central city of la plata. her grandmother, maria isabel chorobik de mariani, has been searching for clara anahi ever since. \"a lot of girls come here to see if they are clara anahi,\" said chorobik, who was knitting a sweater for her granddaughter when the raid took place at her son's house on a november night 36 years ago. \"at first, it was awful to find out that a girl who had the same birthday, the same name and a bunch of other things that made us think it was her didn't match up in the (dna) test,\" she told reuters television. \"my soul's become hardened .\" chorobik founded human rights group the grandmothers of the plaza de mayo to search for the stolen babies of the \"disappeared\" children. so far 102 have been identified, but campaigners say there could be several hundred more who are yet to discover their true identities. when the dictatorship fell in 1983, courts convicted former members of the military junta of human rights crimes. they were later released under an amnesty. in 2005, argentina's supreme court struck down the amnesty at the urging of then-president nestor kirchner, late husband of current president <mark>cristina fernandez</mark>. the kirchners met as student activists in the 1970s, and several of their friends were kidnapped and killed for political activities. since then, courts have convicted and sentenced a series of former military and police officers on human rights charges. the convictions have brought some comfort to rights activists including chorobik. but she says the nightmare of the stolen babies will haunt the victims and their families for years to come. \"sometimes when newspapers report that a missing child has been found and they've met their family, people think it's a fairy tale,\" she said. \"but behind all this, there's a heavy burden on these kids. i'm sure clara anahi has buried in her memory the noise of that attack, the yelling and the gunshots and being separated from her mother .\" we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see our flagship financial information platform incorporating reuters insider an ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution a connected approach to governance, risk and compliance thomson reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing, and interactive television platforms. thomson reuters journalists are subject to an", "articleID": "2012070523_00050071_W", "names": {"Cristina Fernandez": ["Q40649", "Q5791451"]}}, {"date": "2012-07-06", "url": "http://clarionledger.com/article/20120706/NEWS/120706027", "content": "ward 1 jackson city councilman quentin whitwell says a design overlay district -

the environment and the economy. we need to fix it fast .\" under the restore act, 80 percent of the fine money levied against bp is earmarked for the five gulf coast states. it's an unprecedented arrangement. typically, such financial penalties go to an oil-spill liability trust fund and the u.s. treasury's general fund for distribution nationwide. much of the bp money is expected to finance projects already on the drawing board, including some proposed by the u.s. army corps of engineers. mississippi gov. phil bryant named a team tuesday to recommend state projects. trudy fisher, executive director of the mississippi department of environmental quality, will head the state's advisory team. \"our work in this state is just beginning,\" bryant said in a statement. \"the (oil spill) impacted our gulf coast in many complex and serious ways...we will not rest until the gulf coast is made whole .\" mississippi officials and environmental groups say some parts of the state are still recovering from the damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005. \"we hope this helps us get back and beyond before katrina,\" said cathy shropshire, executive director of the mississippi wildlife federation. coast communities weigh how to spend bp oil fines gulf coast lawmakers have succeeded in getting a reluctant congress to award to their communities most of the billions of dollars bp will pay in fines for its role in the 2010 oil spill. paid archives for news older than a week. flip, shop and save on specials from your favorite retailers in jackson, ms 39201", "articleID": "2012070621_00014051_W", "names": {"Brian Moore": ["Q10556944", "Q2924964", "Q2924966", "Q4964796", "Q4964797", "Q4964798", "Q4964799"], "Michael Myers": ["Q52897404", "Q535502", "Q6832999"]}}, {"date": "2012-07-09", "url": "http://fangoria.com/index.php/home/all-news/1-latest-news/7373-toronto-come-see-the-million-dollar-monster-show", "content": "noted toronto artist, gallery curator and professional eccentric christian aldo will be unleashing his most extravagant exhibit/party ever with \"the million dollar monster show\" , an exhibition of modern art inspired by monsters of every persuasion! \"expect the unexpected,\" says aldo. \"imagine, the glorification of\" monster fabulous'. i want this show to immortalize and celebrate the beauty of monsters. \"over 35 celebrated, and up and coming toronto artists will be exhibiting their work-painting and sculpture-at the show in a space 3500 sq. ft with ceilings reaching over 30ft. monsters! pop art! counter culture! rock and roll! don't miss it?. fangoria is a proud sponsor of the million dollar monster show. the party and reception happens on saturday, july 28th from 8pm-2am at 99 sudbury street, toronto, on at aldo's latest gallery/project the super wonder gallery. other highlights to come at the facility this year, according to aldo, will include\" a string of sensationally themed group shows with wild subjects, ranging from science fiction to erotica to trailer trash culture \". 11/11/11, director <mark>keith allan</mark>'s newest film which opens nationally on november 1, makes its world debut a month early at the 2011 big bear horro-fi film festival? in big bear lake, california. 11/11/11 screens at the festival's opening night...\"> it's been reported that clayne crawford has landed a major role in <mark>alan ball</mark>'s all signs of death, the hbo drama pilot based on charlie (sleepless) huston's best-selling crime novel. the truth is out there, and i want to believe it: 30 days of night and the x-files are colliding in a new wildstorm comic .\" > far from home and away from the safety of their military base, a platoon of american soldiers will encounter a brutal story of violence and horror. hidden in the shadows, the dead have come back to life and they have a twisted appetite for flesh. so...\"> having just completed mother's day, word is starting to come in on what may be up next for repo! director darren lynn bousman, and if it's the absolutely ridiculous sounding 90, let's hope it happens soon. read on for more!\" > \"90\" kills in 90 minutes?! story details on bousman's next! julian gilbey's a lonely place to die is apparently all sorts of excellent and now, with nonstop love coming in, word has broke on his next film, offworld. them \"indoors\" , davis and shearsmith on agoraphobic serial killer short", "articleID": "2012070914_00012358_W", "names": {"Alan Ball": ["Q1752144", "Q21453405", "Q2830466"], "Keith Allan": ["Q18683957", "Q56855250", "Q6383969"]}}, {"date": "2012-07-09", "url": "http://al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/07/mountain_brooks_vino_restauran.html", "content": "al rabiee, owner of vino restaurant in mountain brook. mountain brook, alabama -
