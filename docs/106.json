in sanya negotiating how to improve cross-border ties, a 30-year-old chinese fan of prime minister <mark>manmohan singh</mark> described to me his travels in mumbai, delhi and agra. \"your country is

society movement stayed out of the state newspapers for obvious reasons, at a time when mass gatherings even of sections of churchgoers are being swiftly suppressed in beijing. the indication that the kashmir stapled visa dispute is being patched up was splashed only in india. china continues to maintain that its kashmir policy is unchanged and beijing insiders dismiss the visa issue as a technicality. \"it is wrong to play up the visa issue,\" beijing-based strategist rong ying told ht after the announcement in sanya. the big breakthroughs in bilateral relations are still decades away

delhi/chennai: high court verdict rejecting vodafone's plea opposing the merger of the two essar group companies, the indian conglomerate on thursday said its 33% stake in vodafone essar was worth more than the $5 billion that vodafone was offering it. essar's stance counters vodafone group plc chief executive vittorio colao's arguments on tuesday that its jv partner agreed to sell its 33% stake for $5 billion as it could not get a higher valuation. the madras high court on thursday approved the merger of india securities with essar telecommunications holdings pvt ltd that owns an indirect 11% stake in vodafone essar. vodafone had opposed the merger, saying this could be misinterpreted as a fair market value for unlisted vodafone essar, india's second largest telecoms company by customers. \"we have always believed that the fair market value of vodafone essar is higher than the underwritten value, and this is especially so in light of the recent stellar performance of the company,\" an essar spokesperson said, adding that the verdict vindicated the company's stand that \"vodafone did not have any locus standi in relation to this merger as it was neither a shareholder nor a creditor of the relevant companies\". uk-headquartered vodafone said it was \"disappointed\" that the madras high court did not feel it necessary to further investigate the merger. it said the verdict would not affect a separate deal to buy out essar from the joint venture and was confident that the process would be \"completed no later than november this year\". executives close to essar also said despite the high court order it was too late for public shareholders of isl to benefit from this decision as vodafone had already announced it was buying out the essar group's one-third stake in its indian jv. the high court also struck down the opposition of the income-tax department to the merger. rejecting vodafone's plea against the merger, justice <mark>vinod kumar</mark> sharma said the company had no locus standi to file an objection. the agreement between vodafone and essar was formed in two parts: one, a put, or sell, option for 22% held by the essar group overseas and, the other, a call, or buy, option for vodafone to buy 11% stake the essar group held in india. essar had the first right to exercise its option, but if it tendered its entire 22% stake, vodafone's option would become valid. on tuesday, colao had told et that it would not pay more than $5 billion for buying out the ruias' 33% stake. \"essar had two options: sell their entire stake for $5 billion as per the earlier agreement, or appoint an independent entity to arrive at a fair market valuation. that they choose the underwritten floor price proves they could not get a higher valuation (than $5 billion),\" he had said. he also added that ruias' seeking a higher price was a \"psychological\" tactic that all entrepreneurs employ during negotiations. while vodafone's announcement was aimed at ending months of bickering between the two partners and giving it complete ownership of the indian entity, et had recently reported the outbreak of peace was shortlived as both partners appeared to be headed for a new round of confrontation as the ruias' were seeking to extract a higher price for its stake. essar has also argued that its 11% stake held in india is being bought by vodafone is subject to the reserve bank regulations. the april 2010 rbi resolution, which sought to protect domestic companies from aggressive multinational buyers, mandates that indian shares in privately held firms should be valued under the discounted cash flow method. under this method, essar's 11% stake in vodafone essar is worth $1.7-1 .8 billion, compared with the purchase option that pegs it at $1.2 billion \"rbi is also examining whether it would permit vodafone to purchase these shares for $1.2 billion against the discounted cash flow valuation of $1.7 billion,\" one of the executives said. the executives also said that both partners had \"appointed standard chartered bank, goldman sachs and ubs to determine a fair market value of vodafone essar, in advance of the put options, but the valuation exercise by the banks never actually got completed and essar was forced to exercise the fixed price option as time was running out\". they also objected to the vodafone chief executive's announcement that the company was looking at its indian operations by the year-end following the exit of its jv partner. according to them, essar last year pushed for listing vodafone essar but was unsuccessful as \"vodafone refused to dilute its its shareholding\" .", "articleID": "2011042219_00065766_W", "names": {"Vinod Kumar": ["Q21066568", "Q21531067", "Q2527132", "Q27917266", "Q39500993",
