their mind. \"that's obviously different. just because. so says weiszer .\" i would say our recruiting class is a lot like our year this year. we didn't have the kind of year that i wanted to have,

friday following a successful heart procedure to open a blocked artery in his heart that had caused him chest discomfort. clinton, 63, had quadruple heart bypass surgery in 2004 to free up four blocked arteries, and the latest incident comes after he has travelled twice to haiti to help recovery efforts after a devastating earthquake there. \"president clinton was released from new york presbyterian/columbia this morning in excellent health,\" douglas band, counsellor to clinton, said in a statement. \"he looks forward in the days ahead to getting back to the work of his foundation, and to haiti relief and recovery efforts .\" television footage show clinton, who was president from 1993 until 2001, walking to his vehicle as he left the hospital and later arriving at home in the new york suburb of chappaqua. two stents were placed in one of clinton's coronary arteries after tests showed that one of the arteries operated on in 2004 needed to be reopened, dr. allan schwartz, head of cardiology at columbia, told reporters. he said there was no indication clinton had a heart attack or of any damage to his heart. schwartz said clinton could resume his \"very active lifestyle\" and return to work as soon as monday. allan gave the president an \"excellent\" prognosis. clinton's wife, secretary of state hillary clinton, arrived at the hospital on thursday evening, joining daughter chelsea. a senior administration official told reuters that secretary clinton's departure to qatar and saudi arabia, planned for friday, was delayed to saturday but that the delay would not affect her meetings in the two countries. the white house said clinton told president barack obama that he felt \"absolutely great\" after the procedure. having stents placed in heart arteries is a relatively quick and routine procedure among patients like clinton who have suffered from heart disease. stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of blockages via angioplasty. they are now often coated with drugs to help prevent reclogging. just before his 2004 surgery, clinton spoke on cnn's \"<mark>larry king</mark> live,\" about his heart blockage: \"some of this is genetic and i may have done some damage in those years when i was too careless about what i ate...i've got a problem and i've got a chance to deal with it,\" clinton

green bridge that gives insect pests a path to move from winter hosts to cotton plants may reduce in-season insecticide sprayings significantly and could protect seedling cotton from early damage, says an arkansas state university extension entomologist. <mark>scott stewart</mark> told a group of cotton consultants during the recent beltwide cotton conferences in new orleans that timing preplant burndown weed control is critical to minimize early season insect problems .\" controlling weeds in areas around the field and along ditch banks is also critical, \"he said during the annual cotton consultant's conference segment of the beltwide .\" such pests as the tarnished plant bug have a huge host range, \"<mark>stewart</mark> said .\" hosts include henbit and just about every cotton field has henbit. spider mites also like henbit and that weed can be a part of the green bridge. \"<mark>stewart</mark> said the green bridge is vegetation that harbors insect pests that move into cotton .\" we've seen a lot of changes in cotton insect control over the past few years, \"he said .\" bt cotton, the boll weevil eradication program and crop rotation have changed the way we manage pests. \"he said rotation to other crops, such as corn, may provide alternative hosts for sucking bugs and other insect pests. no-till and reduced-till systems also affect pest survival .\" a lot of areas have to use reduced-till to improve conservation, improve production and boost the bottom line, but farmers need to be aware of the effect on insects. \"he said some pests thrive in reduced-till systems. cutworms, slugs, false chinch bugs and aphids, among others, may find favorable conditions in reduced-till fields .\" a good burndown herbicide helps remove the green bridge that allows cutworms to move from one host to another, \"he said. slug problems\" may be exclusive to no-till. false chinch bugs can also cause problems. late weed control is a factor \"in pest survival. <mark>stewart</mark> said thrips numbers may be reduced in no-till systems because of the cooler soil temperatures. but under the right conditions he said farmers can\" get a double whammy with thrips and diseases. \"he said aphids can be more numerous in no-till situations, along with fire ants. plant bugs and spider mites also may be present in higher numbers in no-till or reduced-till systems. <mark>stewart</mark> said control measures in the mid-south may include\" area-wide plant bug management. if we treat ditch banks early enough, along with in-field burndown applications, we can reduce in-season plant bug treatments. this approach will not fit all farms, especially those with small fields scattered over several miles. \"concentrations of crp acreage also make this approach more difficult. he said the economic effect of a timely burndown herbicide application may include one or two fewer in-season plant bug treatments .\" farmers could save almost $6 per acre. we're trying to make growers aware of the need for timely burndown herbicide applications. \"he said controlling all broadleaf weeds at least 21 days before planting is the goal .\" to do that, we need to apply a burndown herbicide four to six weeks earlier. also, pests are mobile so we have to do outside-the-field management and be aware of pest movements. this course covers a wide range of options to effectively control weeds in cotton and reduce the risk of weed resistance management. it is accredited for hours/units for licensed/accredited applicators in 7 u.s. cotton belt states (florida,
