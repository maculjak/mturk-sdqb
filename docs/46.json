and the empire with a supply of sturdy white workers. forty years after the programme stopped, britain and australia are saying sorry to the child migrants, who were promised a better life only to suffer abuse and neglect thousands of miles from home. the british government said on sunday that prime minister <mark>gordon brown</mark> would apologise for child migrant programmes that sent boys and girls as young as three to new zealand, australia, canada and other former colonies. many ended up in institutions where they were physically and sexually abused, or were sent to work as farm labourers. australian prime minister kevin rudd will offer his own apology on monday to the child migrants, as well as to the \"forgotten australians,\" children who suffered in state care during the last century. sandra anker, who was six when she was sent to australia in 1950, said the british government has \"a lot to answer for .\" \"we've suffered all our lives,\" she told the bbc. \"for the government of england to say sorry to us, it makes it right - even if it's late, it's better than not at all .\" the british government has estimated that a total of 150,000 british children may have been shipped abroad between 1618 - when a group was sent to the virginia colony - and 1967, most of them from the late 19th century onwards. most sent to australia after 1920, most of the children went to australia through programmes run by the government, religious groups and children's charities. a 2001 australian report said that between 6000 and 30,000 children from britain and malta, often taken from unmarried mothers or impoverished families, were sent alone to australia as migrants during the 20th century. many of the children were told that they were orphans, though most had either been abandoned or taken from their families by the state. siblings were commonly split up once they arrived in australia. authorities believed they were acting in the children's best interests, but the migration also was intended to stop them from being a burden on the british state while supplying the receiving countries with potential workers. a 1998 british parliamentary inquiry noted that \"a further motive was racist: the importation of\" good white stock' was seen as a desirable policy objective in the developing british colonies. \"ad feedback british children's secretary ed balls said the child migrant policy was\" a stain on our society. \"\"the apology is symbolically very important,\" he told sky news television. \"i think it is important that we say to the children who are now adults and older people and to their offspring that this is something that we look back on in shame,\" he said. \"it would never happen today. but i think it is right that as a society, when we look back and see things which we now know were morally wrong, that we are willing to say we're sorry .\" making amends britain has been trying to make amends since the late 1990s by funding trips to reunite migrants with their families in britain. <mark>brown</mark>'s office said officials would consult with representatives of the surviving children before making a formal apology next year. official apologies for historical wrongs have proved controversial. former australian prime minister <mark>john howard</mark> initially resisted calls to apologise to institutionalised children and australian aborigines, arguing that contemporary australians should not take responsibility for mistakes made by past generations. rudd reversed the policy after he was elected in 2007 and apologised to aborigines for 200 years of injustice since european settlement. at a ceremony on monday in canberra that hundreds of former child migrants are expected to attend, rudd will apologise for his country's role in the migration and say sorry to the 7000 survivors of the programme who still live in australia.", "articleID": "2009111521_00000789_W", "names": {"John Howard": ["Q1467025", "Q51330", "Q5670833", "Q58363217", "Q6228200", "Q6236889", "Q6240028", "Q6240032", "Q6240035", "Q6240041", "Q6240047"]}}, {"date": "2009-11-17", "url": "http://carolinamtnwoman.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/key-oil-figures-were-distorted-by-us-pressure-says-whistleblower/", "content": "the pentagon's building boom in afghanistan indicates a long war ahead official us air force document reveals the true intentions behind the us-colombia military agreement november 16, 2009...2:57 am key oil figures were distorted by us pressure, says whistleblower key oil figures were distorted by us pressure, says whistleblower exclusive: watchdog's estimates of reserves inflated says top official terry macalister guardian.co.uk monday 9 november 2009 the world is much closer to running out of oil than official estimates admit, according to a whistleblower at the international energy agency who claims it has been deliberately underplaying a looming shortage for fear of triggering panic buying. the senior official claims the us has played an influential role in encouraging the watchdog to underplay the rate of decline from existing oil fields while overplaying the chances of finding new reserves. the allegations raise serious questions about the accuracy of the organisation's latest world energy outlook on oil demand and supply to be published tomorrow - which is used by the british and many other governments to help guide their wider energy and climate change policies. \"there's suspicion the iea has been influenced by the us' link to this audio in particular they question the prediction in the last world economic outlook, believed to be repeated again this year, that oil production can be raised from its current level of 83m barrels a day to 105m barrels. external critics have frequently argued that this cannot be substantiated by firm evidence and say the world has already passed its peak in oil production. now the\" peak oil \"theory is gaining support at the heart of the global energy establishment .\" the iea in 2005 was predicting oil supplies could rise as high as 120m barrels a day by 2030 although it was forced to reduce this gradually to 116m and then 105m last year, \"said the iea source, who was unwilling to be identified for fear of reprisals inside the industry .\" the 120m figure always was nonsense but even today's number is much higher than can be justified and the iea knows this. \"many inside the organisation believe that maintaining oil supplies at even 90m to 95m barrels a day would be impossible but there are fears that panic could spread on the financial markets if the figures were brought down further. and the americans fear the end of oil supremacy because it would threaten their power over access to oil resources,\" he added. a second senior iea source, who has now left but was also unwilling to give his name, said a key rule at the organisation was that it was \"imperative not to anger the americans\" but the fact was that there was not as much oil in the world as had been admitted. \"we have [already] entered the\" peak oil' zone. i think that the situation is really bad, \"he added. the iea acknowledges the importance of its own figures, boasting on its website:\" the iea governments and industry from all across the globe have come to rely on the world energy outlook to provide a consistent basis on which they can formulate policies and design business plans. \"the british government, among others, always uses the iea statistics rather than any of its own to argue that there is little threat to long-term oil supplies. the iea said tonight that peak oil critics had often wrongly questioned the accuracy of its figures. a spokesman said it was unable to comment ahead of the 2009 report being released tomorrow. <mark>john hemming</mark>, the mp who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on peak oil and gas, said the revelations confirmed his suspicions that the iea underplayed how quickly the world was running out and this had profound implications for british government energy policy. he said he had also been contacted by some iea officials unhappy with its lack of independent scepticism over predictions .\" reliance on iea reports has been used to justify claims that oil and gas supplies will not peak before 2030. it is clear now that this will not be the case and the iea figures cannot be relied on, \"said <mark>hemming</mark>.\" this all gives an importance to the copenhagen [climate change] talks and an urgent need for the uk to move faster towards a more sustainable [lower carbon] economy if it is to avoid severe economic dislocation, \"he added. the iea was established in 1974 after the oil crisis in an attempt to try to safeguard energy supplies to the west. the world energy outlook is produced annually under the control of the iea's chief economist, fatih birol, who has defended the projections from earlier outside attack. peak oil critics have often questioned the iea figures. but now iea sources who have contacted the guardian say that birol has increasingly been facing questions about the figures inside the organisation. matt simmons, a respected oil industry expert, has long questioned the decline rates and oil statistics provided by saudi arabia on its own fields. he has raised questions about whether peak oil is much closer than many have accepted. a report by the uk energy research centre (ukerc) last month said worldwide production of conventionally extracted oil could\" peak \"and go into terminal decline before 2020 - but that the government was not facing up to the risk. steve sorrell, chief author of the report, said forecasts suggesting oil production will not peak before 2030 were\" at best optimistic and at worst implausible \". but as far back as 2004 there have been people making similar warnings. <mark>colin campbell</mark>, a former executive with total of france told a conference:\" if the real [oil reserve] figures were to come out there would be panic on the stock markets...in the end that would suit no one. \"", "articleID": "2009111716_00063803_W", "names": {"Colin Campbell": ["Q1108386", "Q1108388", "Q1108411", "Q1108531", "Q19414277", "Q22323626", "Q27345368", "Q43911673", "Q5144955", "Q5144956", "Q5144961", "Q55469116", "Q5601509", "Q5601513", "Q56380383", "Q56524218"], "John Hemming": ["Q2354910", "Q673430"]}}, {"date": "2009-11-17", "url": "http://ca.entertainment.yahoo.com/s/cbc/091117/sports/sports_hockey_sp_nhl_avalanche_flames", "content": "saskatchewan (cbc) -

overhauling the $2.5 trillion healthcare system sparked what promises to be a long and bitter debate over president barack obama's top domestic priority. the senate will vote on saturday night on whether to move to debate on the legislation--the first key procedural hurdle for the senate plan and one that requires 60 votes from the 100-member body. \"the finish line is in sight,\" <mark>reid</mark> said. \"i'm confident we'll cross it soon .\" whether democrats succeed depends on <mark>reid</mark>'s ability to keep his party's caucus intact. there is no room for error--democrats control exactly 60 votes, and republicans so far are united in opposition. <mark>reid</mark> dodged questions about whether he had the votes to move forward, telling reporters, \"we'll find out .\" if the senate agrees to take up the bill, the debate would begin on november 30, after next week's us thanksgiving holiday. it would last at least three weeks, making it unlikely obama can sign a final bill by the end of the year. any differences between a senate bill and the house of representatives version passed on november 7 would have to be reconciled before a final bill can be voted on again in both houses and sent to obama to sign. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated <mark>reid</mark>'s bill would cost $849 billion over 10 years--below obama's $900 billion target--reduce the budget deficit by $130 billion in the same period and extend insurance coverage to 31 million more people. the rosy report card from budget analysts could ease doubts about the bill among wavering moderate democrats, but republicans were not impressed. \"we've been warning the american people of the democrats\" plans to raise premiums, raise taxes, and slash medicare in order to fund more government, \"republican leader mitch mcconnell said. cheaper than house the senate bill is less expensive than a more than $1 trillion healthcare measure passed in the house, which would have covered at least 5 million more uninsured. like the house bill, the senate measure would require all americans to buy insurance and would set up exchanges where they could choose among various options. it also would offer subsidies to help low-income workers pay for the coverage. the senate bill includes a government-run insurance option that lets states choose whether to participate, and would halt industry practices like denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. some business trade groups were unhappy about the proposal, including america's health insurance plans, which represents the insurance industry, and the national federation of independent business, which represents small businesses .\" the new healthcare taxes and fees will raise the cost of coverage for individuals, families, and employers, \"said karen ignagni, president of america's health insurance plans. healthcare investors were mostly unconcerned about the senate bill as most provisions were expected, but a surprise proposal for a 5% tax on cosmetic treatments hurt companies such as allergan inc and medicis pharmaceutical corp. republicans criticised tax increases in the bill to help pay for the expanded insurance coverage, including the new tax on elective cosmetic surgery they dubbed a\" botox tax. \"the bill would also raise the medicare payroll tax on high-income workers, which is used to finance the government health program for the elderly, and impose a tax on high-cost\" cadillac \"insurance plans. mcconnell noted some of the bill's deficit reduction was possible because many of its provisions would not kick in until 2014, a year later than in the house bill .\" that's a little bit like being asked to pay your mortgage four years before
