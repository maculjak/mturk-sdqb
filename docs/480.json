(AP Photo/Emre Tazegul) <mark>Trump</mark> expected to meet American pastor released by Turkey October 13 2018 1:28 AM Updated: October 13 2018 1:27 AM Photo Credit: AP Photo/Emre Tazegul WASHINGTON - An American pastor freed after nearly two years of detention in Turkey is expected to meet President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> at the White House on Saturday. The release of Andrew Brunson was a diplomatic triumph for <mark>Trump</mark>, who is counting on the support of evangelical Christians for Republican candidates in the November election. Thousands of <mark>Trump</mark>'s supporters cheered Friday night when he informed them that Brunson was once again a free man. \"I'm really proud to report that earlier today we secured the release of pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey,\" <mark>Trump</mark> said at a campaign rally in Ohio. \"He is now free from jail and he is in the air heading to Germany, where he'll get offered a brief check and I think he's going to be in great shape. And then he's coming to Washington, D.C., tomorrow and we'll say hello to him .\" Brunson, a North Carolina native, was due to arrive at Joint Base Andrews near Washington around noon. \"He went through a lot but he's on his way back,\" added <mark>Trump</mark>, who had pressured the government of Turkey, a U.S. ally, to release Brunson. <mark>Trump</mark> also used the outcome to remind the audience of other detained Americans who regained their freedom under his leadership. They include three Americans released this year by North Korea before <mark>Trump</mark>'s historic meeting with North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark>, and an Egyptian-American charity worker freed by Egypt in 2017. \"We bring a lot of people back and that's good,\" <mark>Trump</mark> said. A Turkish court on Friday convicted Brunson of having links to terrorism and sentenced him to just over three years in prison, but released the 50-year-old evangelical pastor because he had already spent nearly two years in detention. An earlier charge of espionage was dropped. Hours later, Brunson was flown out of Turkey, his home for more than two decades. He was being taken to a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, for a medical check-up before the trip to Washington and Saturday's meeting with <mark>Trump</mark>. \"I love Jesus. I love Turkey,\" an emotional Brunson, who had maintained his innocence, told the court at Friday's hearing. He tearfully hugged his wife, Norine Lyn. Burson's release could benefit Turkey by allowing the government to focus on an escalating diplomatic crisis over Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi contributor to The Washington Post who has been missing for more than a week and is feared dead after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, was killed in the consulate; Saudi officials deny it. Turkey may also hope the U.S. will now lift tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, a move that would inject confidence into an economy rattled by high inflation and foreign currency debt. But Brunson's release doesn't resolve disagreements over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, as well as a plan by Turkey to buy Russian missiles. Turkey is also frustrated by the refusal of the U.S. to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of engineering a 2016 coup attempt. Brunson was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Gulen and Kurdish militants who have been fighting the Turkish state for decades. He faced up to 35 years in jail if convicted of all the charges against him. The pastor, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, and led a small congregation in the Izmir Resurrection Church, was imprisoned for nearly two years after being detained in October 2016. He was formally arrested that December and placed under house arrest on July 25 for health reasons. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had resisted U.S. demands for Brunson's release, insisting that the courts are independent. But he had suggested a possible swap involving Brunson and Gulen, who has denied organizing the coup attempt. ___ Follow Darlene Supervile on Twitter: http: //www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Read More VIEW COMMENTS Melania Trump says she ignores rumors of <mark>Trump</mark>'s infidelity Melania Trump says she loves President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> and has \"much more important things to think about\" than allegations he cheated on her.

With deal on judges, Senate goes home for the elections Less than a week after ending a bruising partisan fight over the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Senate joined the House in heading home for the November mid-term elections, as Democrats and Republicans agreed to allow approval of a package of GOP nominations, freeing those Senators who are up for re-election to return home to campaign. The House left town two weeks ago; both chambers will return for their next votes on November 13, a week after Election Day. Democrats cut the deal despite a lot of grumbling from their own side, as many more liberal activists wanted the Senate to stay in session, and have Democrats force votes and debates over any judicial nominee by President <mark>Trump</mark>. 15 judges were approved in the deal, which included three nominees to federal appeals courts, and a dozen federal district judges. While Democrats have forced Republicans to use extra debate time repeatedly on nominations, GOP leaders have been relentless in using time on the Senate floor for judicial picks by President <mark>Trump</mark> in 2017 and 2018, confirming 84 judges to all levels of the judiciary. And with the rules changes in the Senate--spearheaded by Democrats back in 2012--which eliminated the use of the 60 vote filibuster against judicial nominees, there isn't much Democrats can do to stop those <mark>Trump</mark> nominations, unless Republicans refuse to support the choices. \"<mark>Trump</mark> and McConnell are confirming conservative judges at a breakneck pace in what's sure to be <mark>Trump</mark>'s most enduring legacy,\" said <mark>Brian Fallon</mark>, who worked for Hillary Clinton and the Obama Justice Department, and has tried to spur Democrats to fight harder to block President <mark>Trump</mark>'s nominees. \"Senate Must Stop Rubberstamping of <mark>Trump</mark>'s Takeover of Federal Courts,\" boomed a press release by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, as liberal groups denounced the deal. But without any votes from Republicans--Democrats are powerless to stop the GOP from confirming judges. Their best weapon is to simply win a majority in the Senate in the upcoming election. The Senate has confirmed President <mark>Trump</mark>'s judicial nominees at a historic pace--84 total, including Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, 29 circuit judges, and 53 district court judges .--Leader McConnell (@ senatemajldr) October 11, 2018 A number of other nominations by the President were also approved late Thursday, including a series of ambassadors. As GOP Senators crowed about their record number of judicial confirmations, they also took aim at Democrats on the way out of town. \"Senate Democrats must want to get out of Washington to campaign,\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX). One note--while the House and Senate will not conduct any legislative business until after the elections, but Congress is not officially in \"recess'--so, President <mark>Trump</mark> will not be able to make any recess appointments.

After sealing World Cup qualification against Slovenia this time last year, the 48-year-old moved to a three-man defence that had its kinks but provided the platform for a summer to remember. Southgate ended a run of 16 matches using that defensive structure on Friday as England reverted to a four-man backline against the side that halted their progress at the semi-final stage in Russia, where Croatia's midfield ran amok as they came back to secure a 2-1 extra-time win.

I thought our three midfield players did an excellent job .\" We used the ball well against a very good team, so very pleased with it. The players adapted quickly and well. \"The three at the back, the 3-5-2, allowed some players to bed into international football. People like (<mark>Harry</mark>) Maguire .\" Going into the World Cup, I felt we needed a little bit more protection for the defence and the opportunity to get two forwards in the game. \"Now, I think some of those players are a bit more established. They look very comfortable as a back four .\" So, I think that gives us good opportunities because some of the players that we've got coming through--we've got some very strong No. 8s and wingers coming through the system--so it's good that we have got the opportunity to play different systems. \"Jordan Henderson (left) and John Stones are suspended for the clash with Spain (Adam Davy/PA) Southgate now has to decide whether to stick or twist against a Spain side that mauled Croatia 6-0 after winning the Nations League opener 2-1 at Wembley last month.

Initiative 1634--taxation of food and beverages This initiative would prohibit new local taxes on food or beverages. It would not overturn Seattle's sugary-drink tax, but would block any rate increase. Supporters: Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper, Red Bull North America Opponents: Foundation for Healthy Generations, the American Cancer Society, El Centro De La Raza Initiative 1634, backed to the tune of $13 million by a soda-pop industry that sees a threat to its profits in a growing wave of regulation, would ban local taxes on any food or beverage or ingredient intended for human consumption. The campaign echoes a similarly well-funded effort that took out a smaller statewide soda tax eight years ago. The I-1634 campaign is blanketing the airwaves with advertisements that raise the specter of looming local grocery taxes, while making little or no mention of the sweetened beverages produced by the companies funding the campaign. The public-health advocates opposing I-1634--on a shoestring budget--say the rhetoric about grocery taxes is an attempt to disguise the real purpose of the initiative and its funders. Seattle's sweetened-beverage tax, which raised $10.5 million in its first six months, is designed to discourage consumption and fund health and education programs. It has rankled Seattle retailers who say it is costing them business as consumers go outside the city limits to buy their beverages.

While I-1634 would not repeal the Seattle tax, which took effect Jan. 1, it would ensure that no other Washington cities can follow suit, and would stop any increases in Seattle beyond the current rate of 1.75 cents per ounce. When Seattle's sugary-drink tax is mentioned in I-1634 campaign ads, it's often abbreviated and paired with images that overstate the scope of the tax. In one spot, a mom in the grocery store looks at a container of milk while a narrator talks about Seattle's \"huge new beverage tax .\" In fact, milk-based beverages are explicitly exempted. Proponents originally sought a ballot title that included the word \"groceries,\" but a judge changed it to \"certain items intended for human consumption .\" The focus on local taxes, say opponents of I-1634, hews closely to a strategy employed by the tobacco and gun industries to limit the powers of local government, over which they have less political influence, to regulate them. \"This is an existential battle for the soda-pop industry,\" said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, who opposes the initiative. \"They know that they are now in the same light as tobacco, fossil fuels and other products that have negative externalities and affect public health .\" Earlier this year, lawmakers in Michigan and Arizona enacted bans on local food and beverage taxes. In California, where a handful of cities have enacted sweetened-beverage taxes, the soda industry threatened to bring a statewide initiative to the ballot that would have required a two-thirds majority to raise local taxes of any kind unless the Legislature put a moratorium on local food and beverage taxes, which it did. Oregon voters will decide in November on an initiative backed by a soda industry trade group and grocery chains with similar goals. The campaign backing I-1634 says it will close a \"loophole\" in Washington law that allows local jurisdictions to tax groceries--though not through sales taxes. Sales taxes on groceries were eliminated by a 1977 initiative, but local jurisdictions can still tax food items through other means. Seattle's sweetened-beverage tax, for instance, is structured as an excise tax on businesses distributing the drinks. The campaign's ads suggest that other Washington cities are considering sugary-drink taxes and that taxes on beef, dairy or other groceries could be next. There are few if any examples, however. \"We aren't aware of anybody else who has a tax that would be impacted by this initiative or who had been contemplating one,\" said Sheila Gall, general counsel of the Association of Washington Cities, which does not take a position on political campaigns. But the grocery industry is an easy target for new taxes, said Paul Kapioski, owner of the West Seattle Thriftway and chairman of the Washington Food Industry Association, which gave $20,000 to the I-1634 campaign, the only contributor besides the soda industry. Grocery taxes would exacerbate an already regressive tax code in Washington, hitting low-income people hardest, he said, and soda taxes could be just the beginning as policymakers try to change consumer behavior. \"It only takes one city or one group of people to say here's another area that we can target,\" he said. Kapioski argues that taxes like this, if they happen at all, should be implemented on a state level, both for efficiency in administering the tax collection and so that grocers in one jurisdiction don't lose business to competitors in nearby non-taxed jurisdictions. That's already happening with soda-pop sales for Seattle businesses, particularly those near the edge of the city. \"We've definitely seen a drop in sales in that category,\" said Kapioski, whose store is about a mile and a half from White Center, which has no tax. \"There is some crossover there where people will drive outside of the city limits and buy it substantially cheaper .\" If I-1634 passes, Seattle businesses would continue to have a price disadvantage compared to competitors in adjacent cities. That was news to some of the 1,300 people and businesses listed as endorsers on the yes campaign's website, including Aychu Aweke, at a 7-Eleven at the city limits in northeast Seattle. \"Across from [my] store, McDonald's, no tax. Taco Bell, no tax. Mine, soda tax. I have to increase my price and people don't come to my store,\" Aweke said. \"That hurts my business .\" Aweke said he thought I-1634 would repeal the Seattle tax. When told it wouldn't, he said, \"You called the wrong person .\" He wasn't clear on how his name had been added to the list of I-1634 endorsers--which includes small businesses and restaurants, farm groups and the Teamsters Union, which has many members in the soda industry--but other people on the list said representatives from their soda distributor asked them to sign-on, and that they knew the initiative would leave Seattle's tax in place. Henry Kim at Rotary Grocery in Pike Place Market said he didn't want to see other businesses hurt by the soda tax. \"No other victims for Washington state,\" he said. While some individual businesses report lost sales due to Seattle's tax, it's unclear yet whether the tax is discouraging sweetened beverage consumption or just shifting purchases to other cities. The soda companies funding the I-1634 campaign--The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr. Pepper and Red Bull North America--either did not respond to questions about how the Seattle tax has impacted overall Washington sales, or declined to comment. The companies have for years been concerned about taxes on their products or ingredients, calling that out among their \"risk factors\" in securities filings. Coca-Cola's latest annual report states, \"Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products .\" It goes on to note that taxes on sweetened beverages aiming \"to reduce consumption or to raise revenue...could adversely affect our profitability .\" Voters will have more than anecdotal data about the impact of Seattle's soda taxes before they vote Nov. 6. Researchers at the University of Washington and Public Health Seattle & King County are studying several impacts of Seattle's soda tax, including the extent to which the cost is passed on to consumers. Results on that question for the first half of the year are due Oct. 22, said Jesse Jones-Smith, a UW obesity epidemiologist, co-leader of the research team tasked by the city to evaluate the tax. Additional research will focus on whether the tax has changed attitudes about and reduced consumption of sugary beverages, whether small food stores in Seattle have lost sales and whether people change buying patterns at supermarkets based on the tax, Jones-Smith said. Their research will join a small but growing body of analyses that have followed a wave of new soda taxes around the country and abroad. These new taxes differ from state-level soda taxes that have been around for decades in that they are mostly imposed by cities and are explicitly designed to raise the price for consumers in order to reduce consumption. In one study, researchers found that sweetened-beverage sales had fallen 9.6 percent a year after Berkeley implemented the first large soda tax in the U.S.--1 cent per ounce--in November 2014. The study found overall beverage sales did not decrease, leading researchers to conclude that sweetened beverage taxes \"may be effective in shifting consumers to purchase healthier beverages without causing undue economic hardship and while raising revenue for social objectives .\" In Philadelphia, which began taxing sweetened beverages at a rate of 1.5 cents per ounce in 2017, residents reported lower consumption compared to nearby cities, according to phone surveys conducted for Drexel University researchers. \"Taxation is probably our most powerful policy lever that we could pull in terms of really trying to shift use patterns with these risky products,\" said Vic Coleman of the Washington Healthy Kids Coalition, which opposes I-1634. The opposition campaign has raised $7,650, mainly from the Foundation for Healthy Generations, a Seattle nonprofit, and the American Cancer Society. Coleman hopes people will weigh the potential public health benefits before voting to restrict cities' taxing authority. The link between sweetened beverages and obesity, diabetes and other major health concerns was only just coming into focus the last time a beverage tax came before Washington voters. In 2010, the Legislature passed a carbonated-beverage tax amounting to 2 cents per 12-ounce container--a fraction of the Seattle rate--part of a three-year package of temporary tax increases that were also levied on candy and bottled water to help fill a state budget deficit. That year, the soda industry poured a then-record $16 million into a successful initiative campaign to repeal the tax.", "articleID": "2018101314_00258290_W", "names": {"Dino Rossi": ["Q3707956", "Q5278544"]}}, {"date": "2018-10-14", "url": "http://www.ijpr.org/post/oscar-romero-pope-paul-vi-elevated-sainthood", "content": "<mark>Oscar Romero</mark>, Pope <mark>Paul</mark> VI Elevated To Sainthood By Camila Domonoske \u2022 32 minutes ago Tweet Share Google + Email View Slideshow 1 of 3 A mass for a canonization ceremony of Pope <mark>Paul</mark> VI and the martyred Salvadoran Archbishop <mark>Oscar Romero</mark>, as well as five other people, was in St Peter's Square at the Vatican, on Sunday.

The ceremony featured seven new saints all told, including, as the Vatican put it, \"five other lesser-known blessed .\" <mark>Romero</mark>, who stood up to a violent regime, was killed by a right-wing death squad on a church altar in 1980. He was a strong influence on Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports. \"<mark>Romero</mark>'s dedication to the poor and marginalized greatly influenced the first Latin American pope,\" Poggioli says. \"As soon as he became pope, Francis authorized <mark>Romero</mark>'s canonization--a rebuke to his predecessors, <mark>John Paul</mark> II and Benedict XVI, who believed <mark>Romero</mark> was too far to the left .\" In the ceremony at the Vatican on Sunday, Francis said, <mark>Romero</mark> \"left the security of the world, even his own safety, in order to give his life according to the gospel--close to the poor and to his people .\" During the ceremony, Francis wore \"the blood-stained rope belt that <mark>Romero</mark> wore when he was gunned down,\" The Associated Press reports. Thousands of Salvadoran pilgrims traveled to Rome to watch <mark>Romero</mark>'s canonization, the AP notes. Back in El Salvador, many more stayed up late in the night to watch live video of the canonization of the martyred archbishop. Photos show people weeping in the Gerardo Barrios square in San Salvador, and mothers holding sleepy, blanket-wrapped children in Romeros' hometown of Ciudad Barrios. <mark>Romero</mark>, whose supporters called him by the honorific Monse\u00f1or, was a hero to many, particular El Salvador's poor. But others--including some bishops within the church--accused him of being a communist subversive, driven by politics instead of faith. As NPR's Danny Hajek reports, crowds packed into the cathedral in San Salvador to hear his homilies, and across the country, even more people listened to live radio broadcasts. <mark>Romero</mark> called out bloodshed and defended human rights, becoming known as the \"voice for the voiceless .\" He also named the victims of both murders and disappearances, during a time of widespread silence and denial on the topic, making him a source of news as well as comfort and religious guidance. He exhorted members of El Salvador's military to disobey orders to kill civilians, well aware that he was risking his life by speaking up. Hajek reports: \"<mark>Romero</mark> was a champion of human rights at a time when El Salvador was on the brink of civil war. His tireless fight for civil rights ranks him among figures like Martin Luther King Jr....<mark>Romero</mark>'s voice echoed above the violence that engulfed his country .\" \"At a time of so much confusion and anguish,' <mark>Romero</mark> said in his homily on Feb. 10, 1980,' I want to be a messenger of hope. In the midst of tragedy and bloodshed, there is hope .'\" The next month, <mark>Romero</mark> was assassinated. Pope <mark>Paul</mark> VI, who was also elevated to sainthood on Sunday, oversaw the closing of the Church's pivotal Second Vatican Council, and issued the landmark encyclical that cemented the church's opposition to birth control. NPR's Tom Gjelten revisited that encyclical this summer, 50 years after it was released: \"On July 25, 1968, Pope <mark>Paul</mark> VI stunned Catholics around the world with his announcement of Humanae Vitae,\" Of Human Life, \"a document in which he forcefully reaffirmed the church's previously stated position on the use of artificial birth control, calling it\" intrinsically wrong. \"\"\"We are obliged once more to declare that [methods for] the direct interruption of the generative process,' the pope wrote,'...are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children .'\" Humane Vitae came as a surprise to many Vatican observers. Though an encyclical issued in 1930 already prohibited birth control, a papal commission had been assembled to revisit that ban, and a majority of the commission members suggested that it be dropped. \"The Vatican calls <mark>Paul</mark> VI the\" pope of modernity \"for his influence on changes in\" liturgy, seminary formation, theological study, and many other areas of ecclesiastical life. \"The five other saints canonized on Sunday were all born in Europe during the 18th or 19th century: <mark>Francesco Spinelli</mark>, born in Milan in 1853, founded a community of nuns.

Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"On the global stage, the UK is driving forward action on climate change through our work at the UN and with our Commonwealth partners .\" To ensure that we continue to lead from the front, we are asking the experts to advise on targets for net zero emissions. \"Are we on the #RoadtoZero road transport emissions? The 2050 target requires it. DfT's strategy wasn't out in time for our 2018 report--yesterday we wrote to @ transportgovuk & @ beisgovuk Lots to welcome (esp charging infra) but it won't meet cost effective path to the targets. https: //t.co/vK76ppbqcJ--Chris Stark (@ ChiefExecCCC) October 12, 2018 The request to the CCC comes after a major UN report said countries must take\" unprecedented \"action to slash carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Limiting warming to 1.5 C is possible but will require fast and far-reaching changes to power generation, industry, transport, buildings and potential shifts in lifestyle such as eating less meat. It will also require action to take excess carbon emissions out of the atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. The letter to CCC chairman Lord Deben invites his committee to consider what emissions reductions would be needed to make an appropriate contribution to the Paris target of a\" well below 2C \"rise or the 1.5 C limit urged in the new report. Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said the CCC would give\" advice on a roadmap to a net zero economy, including how emissions might be reduced and the expected costs and benefits of doing so \". The move comes at the start of the Green GB Week initiative, and the Government claimed that jobs in green industries could reach two million by 2030, generating up to \u00a3 170 billion in exports. Ministers will also set out proposals for new laws for\" smart energy \"appliances like washing machines and electric heating, with the ambition of making all new buildings smart by 2030. Environmental campaigners welcomed the Government's net-zero move, but called for a commitment to the 1.5 C goal. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate at WWF said:\" Scientists from around the world said we had 12 years to tackle climate change. \"Governments can no longer shirk their responsibilities .\" It's time to act and, crucially, embrace the opportunities a green economy presents. \"Done right, this could be the biggest economic opportunity in history, driving innovation, job creation and better living standards .\" By limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 \u00b0 C, we could reduce air pollution and save the lives of 153M children, neighbours, and people around the world.

The Scottish First Minister used a speech in London on Monday to urge Westminster politicians to vote down any compromise deal the Prime Minister can strike with Brussels. She accused the UK Government of \"threatening us with fire, to make us choose the frying pan\" , and argued that any deal that is presented to the Commons was likely to be deliberately vague about the future relationship and damaging to the UK's interests. Ms Sturgeon told an audience at the Royal Society of Arts that voting down the Prime Minister's proposal would allow a deal keeping the UK in the customs union and single market--which the SNP wants--to be presented instead. Voting against \"a bad or blindfold Brexit\" was not a vote for no-deal, she argued, but \"the only chance the House of Commons will have to reset these negotiations and think again before it is too late\". She said: \"As the crucial vote looms closer, it is also time for individual members of the House of Commons to consider what compromises they see as justified--and which are not--if they are to serve their constituents, and the wider public interest .\" If they do that, I believe that a commonsense outcome could yet be found. \"Ms Sturgeon has said the SNP's strong preference is to remain in the EU (Jane Barlow/PA) She added:\" For MPs to support a bad or blindfold Brexit--a cobbled-together withdrawal agreement and a vague statement about our future relationship--would, in my view, be a dereliction of duty. \"In the June 2016 referendum, Scotland voted by 62% to 38% in favour of remaining in the EU. As part of her speech, the First Minister presented a new paper from the Scottish Government--Scotland's Place in Europe: Our Way Forward. It noted that the\" core \"of the proposal was the same as it set out in December 2016. Writing in her foreword to the paper, Ms Sturgeon said:\" The Scottish Government, in line with the overwhelming vote for Remain in Scotland, supports continued EU Membership. Remaining in the EU continues to be our strong preference. \"Nevertheless in December 2016 we set out a compromise plan to keep Scotland and the UK in the European Single Market and Customs Union to limit the damage of Brexit as much as possible .\" It is therefore simply incorrect for the Prime Minister to say that there is no alternative to Chequers. \"In fact, the UK Government's position is increasingly absurd--insisting on pursuing proposals they have been told will not work while rejecting a plan that will .\" She adds: \"With crucial decisions coming up over the next few weeks and months at EU level--and in the House of Commons, where the UK Government must seek the approval of the UK Parliament--it is vital to break the deadlock .\" For the Prime Minister and the UK Government it is time to face reality. For MPs at Westminster it is time to come together in a commonsense coalition to minimise the Brexit damage. \"A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union (Dexeu) said:\" We will have an ambitious course outside of the EU that enhances our prosperity and security and that genuinely works for everyone across the UK. \"We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU and look forward to continuing to engage with the EU Commission on our proposals .\" 0 comments", "articleID": "2018101512_00316813_W", "names": {"Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"]}}, {"date": "2018-10-17", "url": "https://www.scout.com/Article/Torrey-Smith-Panthers-vs-Eagles-123447096/", "content": "Torrey Smith looking forward to playing against former team Slot to Scout.com Newsletter Players going up against their former teams can be a complicated affair. For some players, it's a welcome opportunity to see some old friends, reminisce about good memories, and try to beat them. But for others, it's a personal grudge match - An opportunity to stick it to an organization that let you go. Fortunately, Carolina Panthers wide receiver falls into the former category. Now in Carolina after a one-year stint with the Philadelphia Eagles, Smith is a welcome face in what is usually a hostile environment for opposing teams to play in - That'll happen when you're a member of the Eagles' first-ever Super Bowl-winning team. Torrey Smith \"\"said Smith of returning to Philadelphia in a report by Jelani Scott of the Panthers .\" I'm the only one who hasn't been able to see it yet. \"I can't wait to see the (Super Bowl LII Champions) banner, Although the Eagles opted during the offseason not to make Smith a part of their plans moving forward, trading him to the Panthers instead, Smith continues to speak highly of his former team. And, in return, Eagles head coach spoke highly of him. Doug Pederson\" \"said Pederson .\" I think that's the same thing he's doing in Carolina ....He's a great leader - A great man, first of all. Good person ....He is explosive and he can make plays on the ball and down the field. That's what helped us a year ago win a championship. \"I'm so grateful for what Torrey did and what he brought to this football team with his leadership ability, Although Smith had a quiet first month as a Panther, he is coming off of his best performance of the season against the Washington Redskins. While he didn't get the ball until the fourth quarter, Smith ended up catching all five of his targets for 43 yards and a touchdown, as well as a two-point conversion. Smith acting when called upon, in addition to his veteran leadership and the way he conducts himself, factors in to why quarterback referred to Smith as a\" pro \". <mark>Cam Newton</mark>\" \"said <mark>Newton</mark>.\" This is a production-based league, this is a production-based society. When those opportunities came to him, he made the most of them. And we wouldn't have expected anything else from him because of his whole approach. No one cares that he didn't get any passes thrown to him (until) the fourth quarter, Bring well-traveled in the course of his NFL career, Smith brings a wealth of perspective to the Panthers' Week Seven match: He's played in Philadelphia as a member of the Eagles, and as a member of the visiting team. He's very familiar with quarterback (Who Smith called a \"magician\" ), and how talented and well-coached the Eagles' defense is. Carson Wentz But being a pro entails not allowing sentimentality to get in the way of your job.

Now our furniture looks much better, and our customers are enjoying their shopping experience .\" <mark>Chen</mark> had been paying steep energy bills just to keep the lights on in his 10,000-square-foot store, and the ancient lights were dim and dreary. It was his friend--a fellow small business owner--who suggested he reach out to Efficiency Nova Scotia and inquire about their Small Business Program. \"When I heard I could switch to energy-efficient LED lighting and Efficiency Nova Scotia would cover up to 60 per cent of the cost, I couldn't believe it,\" says <mark>Chen</mark>. His business saw a savings of more than 13,000 kWh, which equates to an estimated savings of just over $1,200 per year--cutting the power bill nearly in half. <mark>Chen</mark>'s employees love the new lighting, too, since it makes for a more comfortable environment and allows them to work more safely. \"They thought I'd spent a lot of money to make everything so nice and bright,\" says <mark>Chen</mark>. \"They were so surprised to hear the new lights were actually saving us money, because the store has never looked better .\" He's so happy with Efficiency Nova Scotia that he's talking them up whenever he meets another small business owner. \"I went to a convenience store the other day and the owner and I got to talking about power bills,\" says <mark>Chen</mark>. \"He was paying what I used to pay, and his store is maybe 1,000 square feet and mine is 10,000 square feet.
