(AP Photo/Jessica Hill) Published December 01. 2019 5:36 PM Hartford--UConn spends the first hour of every practice working on defense. Nothing else but defense. \"And then we lead to more defense,\" redshirt junior Alterique Gilbert said. \"It's really something that (coach <mark>Dan Hurley</mark>) is emphasizing this year .\" The Huskies are starting to get the desired results from their hard work. An aggressive defense helped turn a tight non-conference game into a runaway, as UConn forced Maine into 28 turnovers on the way to a 64-40 victory before 7,129 fans at the XL Center. It's been 19 years since the Huskies forced that many turnovers, accomplishing the feat against Fairfield. They scored 28 points off the turnovers and also had a season-high 13 steals. \"That's probably the most important thing for us this year is defensive pressure,\" sophomore Brendan Adams said. \"We've got a lot depth so we can run guards and bigs in and out and just keep pressuring the ball .\" Adams and freshman James Bouknight provided a spark off the bench, scoring 11 and a team-best 15 points, respectively. Gilbert (13 points) and junior Tyler Polley (12 points) also hit double figures for the Huskies (5-2). The Huskies entered Sunday's game looking to build on the success that they experienced in the Charleston Classic in South Carolina. Their performance wasn't a thing of beauty, but did the job. They never trailed and led by as many as 24. <mark>Hurley</mark> felt the Huskies didn't take full advantage of their athleticism and edge in talent and depth. They showed signs of immaturity and struggled to finish at the rim, he added. \"I was thrilled with the first two minutes and happier with the last 20...,\" <mark>Hurley</mark> said. \"Coming out of this, we've got to get better offensively. We're not going to be able to out-tough and out-heart the better teams because all the better teams play really hard .\" ...We're not there yet. We've got a lot of work to do. \"Up until UConn's pressure defense changed the game early in the second half, Maine (2-5) controlled the tempo, slowing the action down to a crawl. The Huskies, who shot just 38 percent from the field, needed something to lift them out of an offensive funk. The defense provided the necessary jolt, forcing nine turnovers during a four and a half minute stretch to help ignite a 17-2 spurt that pushed a five-point lead to 20. The Huskies extended their pressure defense and Maine, which was playing without its starting point guard, crumbled. Adams was in the middle of the action. He stole the ball and took off for fast break layup. Then after making a steal, senior Christian Vital fed Adams who rose up a monster dunk over a Maine player for a 42-30 lead .\" That felt great, \"Adams said with a smile. The Huskies kept attacking, building a 52-32 lead with 11:28 left on Jalen Gaffney's steal and transition basket. They cruised to the finish line from there .\" Coach was emphasizing all week that we need to pressure them and pressure them for 40 minutes, \"Vital said .\" If you didn't do that, you were coming out of the game. It's fun as hell to play like that. \"Maine coach <mark>Richard Barron</mark> called UConn's defense elite. The Black Bears shot an icy 35 percent from the field .\" UConn really came out and got in our shorts and made it tough on us, \"<mark>Barron</mark> said. Expect defense to continue to be the backbone for the Huskies this season. They're embracing <mark>Hurley</mark>'s defensive mindset .\" We practiced hard at it and that's what we're definitely going to keep doing all season, \"said Adams who finished with a career-best four steals. <mark>Hurley</mark> has seen improvement in his team's defense since the beginning of the season. But he's far from satisfied .\" We made a big jump just in terms of numbers, \"<mark>Hurley</mark> said .\" Akok (Akok) has helped us so much at that end of the court. Guys are a year more experienced and we emphasize it every day. \"Your only chance to play in any type of significant way in March is if you're a top 50 defensive team. And we're right around that number right now in terms of efficiency. I didn't think we were great today. I thought we had some breakdowns and we'll look at it and get it fixed .\" News and notes The Huskies played without reserve Sidney Wilson, who's sidelined with a knee injury. He may be ready to return for Wednesday's game against Iona in Storrs. \"We got best case scenario news,\" <mark>Hurley</mark> said. \"We're hopeful that he'll be able to do more (Monday).\" ...GIlbert, who entered the game shooting 22 percent, made his first two shots--both three-pointers--and finished 5 for 8 from the field. \"It was just good to see the ball go in,\" said GIlbert, who had 11 points in the first half. g.keefe @ theday.com", "articleID": "2019120122_00114267_W", "names": {"Dan Hurley": ["Q16729984", "Q5213719"], "Richard Barron": ["Q21289724", "Q27925010", "Q7323978"]}}, {"date": "2019-12-02", "url": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/notable-6", "content": "Notable By Josh Marshall | December 2, 2019 1:33 p.m. JOIN TPM FOR JUST $1 From Nathan Gonzales in Roll Call...\"With a combination of Republicans' self-inflicted wounds, slow recruiting, or suburbs continuing to shift against the president, Democratic chances of winning improved in a dozen House races in recent weeks.

Only five managers clocked in on Monday, those involved in fixtures on Tuesday, and <mark>Brendan Rodgers</mark> less than 24 hours after his sides last gasp win over Everton. Make sure you're following throughout the build-up for all the latest Premier League updates. Our Player News page contains breaking headlines while last-minute injury updates are added to the Injury Report. Good luck! Follow the entire Rotoworld Premier League team on Twitter: Neal | Steve | <mark>Andrew</mark> | Sean | Stag | <mark>Ben</mark> | Nik Crystal Palace--vs--AFC Bournemouth Mamadou Sakho is set for a possible recall to the starting XI as the Eagles defensive options become stretched. <mark>Scott Dann</mark> was sent for a scan on Monday after picking up an ankle injury at Turf Moor. \"We hope it's not a ligament issue. We hope it's a kick, but of course, it's far too soon, too close to the game for him to recover so he'll miss tomorrow's game .\" <mark>Gary Cahill</mark> (knee) is also sidelined. \"We hope to recover the pair of them for the game at the weekend [Watford].\" No fresh injury concerns from Saturday, the squad came through the defeat to Tottenham relatively unscathed. <mark>Simon Francis</mark> and Philip Billing are back in contention after serving a ban in week fourteen. Lloyd Kelly (thigh) is edging closer while Junior Stanislas (knee) is back on the training pitches, although after several months out, it may be next year before Eddie Howe considers the winger. <mark>Andrew Surman</mark> is working with the group, but <mark>Charlie Daniels</mark> and <mark>David Brooks</mark> remain sidelined. <mark>Adam Smith</mark> missed out on Saturday due to illness, and a decision on his availability could be made closer to kick-off. It's still a little too soon for <mark>Joshua King</mark> (hamstring). Burnley--vs--Manchester City <mark>Charlie Taylor</mark> continues to be assessed, but the early indications are that he did not suffer a serious hamstring injury against Crystal Palace. However, with the quick turnaround, Sean Dyche will look to make a late call. Erik Pieters is a ready-made replacement, and despite picking up a knock, he is expected to start at left-back. <mark>Ashley Westwood</mark> is available after suspension, although the midfielder is struggling with a slight groin problem and faces a late test. Tuesday will come too soon for Johann Berg Gudmundsson who is back on the grass and working with the physios. \"He is building up his power and sharpness, and that is the final bit to come .\" Danny Drinkwater is \"as close as you can get\" in terms of his fitness, and Matej Vydra is fit after recovering from a hip injury. Pep Guardiola reveals Sergio Ag\u00fcero will miss the Manchester derby (GW16) after failing to recover from a muscular issue. Ilkay Gundogan is suspended for Tuesday, so expect a return for Rodri who was left out of the draw on Tyneside until the 84th minute. No other injury concerns - Aymeric Laporte and Leroy San\u00e9 remain out until early 2020 - while <mark>Oleksandr Zinchenko</mark> is back on the training pitches. Fernandinho will continue at centre-back as Pep prefers the Brazilian to be in his backline, which is why Stones/Otamendi have not been paired together. Leicester City--vs--Watford Demarai Gray is the only fitness concern for Wednesday; the winger has been ill over the weekend. \"Everyone else is fine,\" apart from long-term absentee Matty James (Achilles). Three months (or just 85 days). That was all the time afforded to Quique Sanchez Flores in his second spell at the club before results ultimately dictated the board's decision to sack the 54-year-old. Hayden Mullins will take temporary charge of the Hornets with an extensive injury list...Up to eight players are at risk of missing out, and with a press conference still to come, I'll focus on the definites, the maybes, and those almost there. Danny Welbeck is out until the new year, and it's difficult to see Sebastian Prodl or Tom Cleverley returning for this one given the game time they've missed. Daryl Janmaat and Christian Kabasele - knee and hamstring respectively--can't be ruled out entirely as the severity of their injuries remains unclear. Craig Dawson is best placed to return despite stitches in a head wound. Kiko Femen\u00eda suffered a knock at St Mary's and QSF had suggested that one of his substitutes was injured during the warm-up, and that was the reason Andre Gray came on to replace Gerard Deulofeu. That suggests Troy Deeney, Domingos Quina or <mark>Roberto Pereyra</mark> won't be ready. Manchester United--vs--Tottenham Hotspur Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful of having Scott McTominay or Paul Pogba back for the game on Wednesday as the pair step up their recovery. The former seems best placed as he had been touted for a return in week 14, but Pogba won't be too far away following a stint in the US to build fitness. Anthony Martial is one to watch; his withdrawal may have been enforced, although there was no mention of a problem post-match. Assessments will continue throughout the build-up to the game, and last-minute decisions are not uncommon with such a quick turnaround. Luke Shaw returned to the matchday squad but looks way off the pace after more than three months out, so <mark>Brandon Williams</mark> should keep his place. Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, <mark>Marcos Rojo</mark>, Nemanja Matic and Diogo Dalot remain sidelined. Jose returns to his former stomping ground and Spurs will be looking to make it four straight wins, although they will need to be a bit more Mourinho-like after conceding twice in each of the last three. Jan Vertonghen and Tanguy Ndombele were back in the XI on Saturday, but unless Christian Eriksen commits his future to the club, then his game time looks to be very limited. No fresh concerns--Hugo Lloris, Michel Vorm, <mark>Ben Davies</mark> and Erik Lamela are out--although the Argentine is in the last phase of his conditioning before re-joining the group. Wolverhampton Wanderers--vs--West Ham United Romain Saiss comes back into contention with Max Kilman, who made his full Premier League debut on Sunday, being the player most likely to miss out. The status of <mark>Ryan Bennett</mark> (groin) and Morgan Gibbs-White is unknown, but both have been managing issues for a while now, and I wouldn't expect a great deal of change within 48-72 hrs. Willy Boly is progressing and is on schedule to return in January. Saturdays' coupon buster--a win at Stamford Bridge--ended a run of eight games (all comps) without victory and Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping for more of the same. Michail Antonio will need to be checked after his first start in over three months, and with Issa Diop back in the frame, Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena could make way. <mark>David Martin</mark>, 33, and son of former West Ham legend Alvin kept a clean sheet on his debut and looks set to continue with <mark>Roberto</mark> missing out. Jack Wilshere is training, alongside <mark>Winston Reid</mark>, but it's too soon, and neither will be considered. Chelsea--vs--Aston Villa <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> will give Tammy Abraham every chance to prove his fitness ahead of the game. \"We will find out more today and tomorrow. He needs to get outside and move a little bit over the next two days .\" If he fails to recover, then the Blues boss suggested that Christian Pulisic is an option. \"He does have an ability to run behind the line, and to be sharp in central areas which will naturally get him more goals .\" He also went onto add that the decision to play Olivier Giroud over Michy Batshuayi was just a \"choice for this game .\" No sign of Ross Barkley and Antonio R\u00fcdiger needs to get \"properly fit\" following knee and muscle injuries which have kept him sidelined for the best part of seven months. El Mohamady could start his first league game since August after Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert collected his fifth caution of the season at Old Trafford. And <mark>Dean Smith</mark> may be forced into a second change with El Ghazi a major doubt due to a knee injury, the Dutchman was replaced by Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet after just 18 minutes, and the winger is expected to keep his place. Bjorn Engels has recovered from a hip issue, but the defender will struggle to displace Ezri Konsa who has grasped his opportunity with both hands. Jed Steer (Achilles) is out for around three months, and Jota is training after groin surgery, but he lacks conditioning and will build fitness behind-closed-doors. Southampton--vs--Norwich City The Saints staged a remarkable comeback to take an unlikely three-points in the late kick-off on Saturday, a victory which ultimately cost Sanchez Flores his job. Danny Ings started the ball rolling in the 78 th minute--his seventh of the campaign--before James Ward-Prowse capped his man-of-the-match performance with a stunning free-kick. The pair are responsible for the Saints' last ten league goals. Stuart Armstrong (hamstring) is the only confirmed injury doubt, and the Scot is pencilled in for a return in week seventeen. The Canaries almost made it back-to-back wins, but Arsenal came from behind for a share of the spoils. Pukki got the party underway, and Todd Cantwell followed up his goal at Goodison Park with his fourth of the season. The return of <mark>Christoph Zimmermann</mark> cannot be underestimated, and the big German has offered some solidity to the Norwich backline, something which they missed in his absence. There was no Alex Tettey on Sunday due to personal reasons, and the midfielder is the only one of those who were unavailable in week 14 who stands a realistic chance of returning. Liverpool--vs--Everton Adri\u00e1n will start in the Merseyside derby following Alisson's dismissal against Brighton. Jurgen Klopp said the \"frozen\" goalkeeper was his man-of-the-match on Saturday after two \"really good saves .\" Ballon d\u2019Or runner-up Virgil Van Dijk was the pundit's choice with two headed first-half goals which helped the Reds to another three-points. Fabinho (ankle) will probably not feature again this year, while there is no timeline for Joel Matip (knee) who was scheduled for a follow-up scan last Friday. <mark>Marco Silva</mark> is hanging on in there, but another defeat here could see the Portuguese boss relieved of his duties with Everton sitting in 17 th just two points above the drop zone. Theo Walcott and Fabian Delph will be checked, but even though Morgan Schneiderlin made the bench on Saturday, the midfielder was not 100 per cent. Jean-Philippe Gbamin, <mark>Andr\u00e9 Gomes</mark> and Seamus Coleman are already confirmed as out. Sheffield United--vs--Newcastle United Chris Wilder is expected to confirm that his squad have a clean bill of health following the return of <mark>John Egan</mark> (calf) on Sunday. Lys Mousset continued his rich vein of form at Molineux, and his 5-goals have helped the newly-promoted side climb to seventh in the table. Allan Saint-Maximin probably offers Newcastle's biggest attacking threat, so Steve Bruce will be hoping the Frenchman can shake off a minor knock. The additional recovery time for the Thursday night kick-off will undoubtedly help...Andy Carroll should be close after missing out on Saturday with a rib injury, and a decision on DeAndre Yedlin (groin) will be left until late - Javier Manquillo could deputise once again. Jamaal Lascelles (knee) is out while Fabian Sch\u00e4r must be patient after losing his place; the <mark>Federico Fernandez</mark> and Ciaran Clark partnership has worked well with Paul Dummett making up the central trio. Florian Lejeune can be called upon if required. Arsenal--vs--Brighton and Hove Albion Freddie Ljungberg suggested that the performances of Pepe in training meant that the big-money summer signing would not be considered for a starting berth. Indeed, the Ivorian was an unused substitute during the draw at Carrow Road. Shkodran Mustafi was back for the first time on Sunday, but it was the same old Arsenal who were lucky to leave Norwich with a point. There has been very little mention of Rob Holding--not listed on the site as injured--although he has been carrying a knee problem. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn's hamstring will be tested after missing the last two. No Dani Ceballos until mid-December following his injury in the Europa League. Brighton were very unfortunate to leave Anfield with nothing, after a slow start the Seagulls steadily grew into the game, and following Alisson's sending off, Graham Potter's men took the game to the league leaders. However, the result means that they have now lost 4 of their last six away matches and the Emirates will be another tough test. Aaron Connolly was handed an immediate recall, but with Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay both champing at the bit to be involved, Brighton have lots of attacking options. It may or may not include Solly March who is managing a slight groin problem. Bernardo returned for the U23s last week, and it remains to be seen whether the full-back is deemed fit enough for the first team after close to three months on the sidelines. <mark>Ben</mark> Dinnery", "articleID": "2019120300_00005437_W", "names": {"Adam Smith": ["Q14950467", "Q16255210", "Q20023132", "Q22121229", "Q33035156", "Q350916", "Q350920", "Q42763651", "Q4679545", "Q4679802", "Q4679803", "Q4679807", "Q4679808", "Q48976986", "Q52116879", "Q5539790", "Q56997269", "Q57451408", "Q58051258", "Q58219052", "Q59065"], "Andrew Surman": ["Q27906035", "Q507852"], "Andr\u00e9 Gomes": ["Q16490302", "Q519008", "Q9614301"], "Ashley Westwood": ["Q10857014", "Q59428"], "Ben Davies": ["Q41251646", "Q4885504", "Q4885507", "Q4885508", "Q4885509", "Q4885510", "Q4885511", "Q4888471", "Q53951851", "Q723161", "Q93555"], "Brandon Williams": ["Q16232032", "Q24007026", "Q2923793", "Q4957141", "Q4957142", "Q4957143", "Q4957144", "Q4957145"], "Brendan Rodgers": ["Q19973684", "Q310623"]}}]
