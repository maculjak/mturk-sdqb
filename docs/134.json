joe paterno is a disgrace fifteen frustrating years could come to an end for the pasadena high school football team if it stops the run while developing a potent ground game that moves the chains. sweet victory no. 13 in a row could come muir's way if it plays with discipline and utilizes its team speed and versatility on offense. those are the variables the bulldogs and mustangs hope to execute when they meet in the 57th turkey tussle at 7 tonight at the rose bowl. the intense rivalry has been anything but, with muir (5-4, 3-3) winning 14 of the last 15 meetings. the teams tied in 1998 and pasadena has not won since 1995. and with a cif-southern section southeast division playoff berth on the line last season, it was the mustangs who got up for the game and put on a clinic with a 63-6 win. playoff implications once again are on the line, especially for muir. a win by the mustangs all but secures them a spot in the playoffs. a loss puts an abrupt ending to muir's season that was surrounded by hype early after a strong start and a high ranking in the southeast division. pasadena (5-4, 4-2) is all but assured a playoff spot, but the scenario could become hazy depending on what happens in the pacific league between burroughs (5-4, 5-1) and burbank (5-4, 3-3) on friday, as well as the matchup between arcadia (7-2, 5-1) and crescenta valley (6-3, 4-2), also on friday. the bulldogs, however, can't take solace in a likely playoff berth despite a loss. pasadena for too long has been dominated in a rivalry that has dissipated with every lopsided loss through the course of over a decade. school officials said this week the game could draw 13,000 fans, and announced that for the first time parking fees will be charged. but that will do little, if at all, to hold back the large fan bases of each school from attending. pasadena's randy horton has taken giant strides in just two seasons as head coach, elevating the program and turning it into a playoff contender. that the bulldogs were routed in last year's tussle may be perplexing to some given a playoff berth was on the line, but pasadena still was a young team gaining a new perspective from a coach who wanted to change a seemingly losing culture. pasadena has made considerable improvement through the season, particularly on defense. it's there where horton feels the bulldogs need to make the biggest impact if they are to break the muir streak. \"we have to tackle on defense and run to the ball,\" horton said. \"if we play the way we did against cathedral (when pasadena nearly pulled off its biggest upset) and like we did in the second half against crescenta valley, we'll be ok. we have to seize the moment .\" quarterback brandon cox is the focal point on offense for the bulldogs. \"he'll definitely be a concern for our defense,\" muir interim coach dave mitchell said. \"we have to be disciplined in our assignments. our defensive linemen can't push so far up the field that he steps up to the pocket and then bounces out underneath them. it's a matter of staying disciplined and containing him when he rolls out of the pocket .\" marcus green and riian simpson have benefited from cox's rise as one of the premier quarterbacks in the san gabriel valley. cox can sit in the pocket and read defenses, usually running when the pocket collapses or when the defense gives him open lanes. running back cleo bates has the ability, size and speed to go the distance, and he will be instrumental in helping the bulldogs establish the run if pasadena is to have a balanced attack. an offensive line that's a year older and stronger has improved considerably, led by freddy barnes, oscar rojas and <mark>alejandro contreras</mark>. \"we have to sustain blocks and open holes,\" horton said. \"we can't just sit back and throw the ball. you have to be able to run .\" muir's offensive weapons range from josh washington at quarterback to kevon seymour lining up out of the wildcat or freshman darick holmes jr. entering as a backup to bring a different dynamic at quarterback. washington-bound tairen owens is dangerous in the backfield and at wide receiver, and the mustangs will have to find a way to exploit their team speed. \"we realize we have a few options,\" mitchell said. \"offensively we have to get the ball in the hands of our playmakers .\" both teams paid a visit to the rose bowl this week. it seemed routine for muir, but pasadena's horton had one last message for the bulldogs before leaving the stadium.", "articleID": "2011111014_00078121_W", "names": {"Alejandro Contreras":

carter</mark>, president of sprint wholesale solutions and new ventures, said the company is accelerating its push into the wholesale business and is providing more services to its wholesale customers. sprint currently has around more than 100 wholesale customers, representing 6.3 million subscribers. sprint's total customer base is 53 million. the focus on wholesale, in addition to sprint's emphasis on its prepaid brands such as assurance wireless, indicate that the carrier increases is looking beyond postpaid subscribers to grow its business. <mark>carter</mark> said sprint is offering its wholesale customers services such as billing, marketing support and competitive analysis, rather than just selling them capacity. \"we are kind of a factory that produces these capabilities,\" he said. some of sprint's most high-profile wholesale customers include leap wireless (nasdaq: leap) and best buy, as well as smaller players such as credo mobile, liberty wireless and platinumtel. wholesale has become an increasingly critical part of sprint's business. sprint added a net of 835,000 wholesale and affiliate subscribers in the third quarter, nearly double the 441,000 retail subscribers it added. that was a stark reversal from the third quarter last year when wholesale additions trailed sprint's branded customers. sprint said in august it would start wholesaling

purchase of the astros unless he agreed to move the team to the american league, the associated press has learned. crane was forced to agree to move the sale along, a person familiar with the negotiations said today, on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made by mlb nor the astros. approval of the sale could be announced as early as thursday, at a meeting of baseball executives in milwaukee. crane reportedly agreed to the move in exchange for a drop in the sales price valued earlier this year at $680 million. the person who spoke to the ap could not confirm the sales price. the mlb players association believes two 15-team leagues would create a more proportionate schedule and has urged baseball to make the switch. with schedules for next season already completed, the earliest such a move could take place is 2013. time is running out for approval of the deal: crane has said that his offer, which was announced on may 16 expires nov. 30. an mlb spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment, though commissioner bud selig addressed an astros move during a twitter chat monday. \"for 15/15 realignment, houston would be the team moving to al west. would create more fairness in baseball,\" selig tweeted via the colorado rockies' twitter feed. he also added that \"15 teams in each league would necessitate interleague play every day but it will be better schedule overall .\" the astros currently play in the six-team nl central. the al west is the only league in the majors with four teams (rangers, angels, athletics and mariners). the astros would be in a division with in-state rival texas. but fans are unhappy that the other three teams are all on the west coast, meaning many road games would routinely end past midnight central time. drayton mclane (michigan state) bought the team in november 1992 for about $117 million and put the franchise up for sale in november. he turned down an offer from crane to buy the team in 2008. the $680-million sale price is the second-highest in major league history, trailing the $845-million purchase of the chicago cubs by the ricketts family two years ago. the $660-million sale of the boston red sox in 2002 currently is second. like the astros deal, the cubs and red sox transactions included related entities. a major selling point in houston was the astros' share in a new deal with the nba's houston rockets to create a regional sports network that will begin airing rockets games in 2012 and the astros in 2013. crane has said the team's 30-year lease at minute maid park, which is owned by the harris county houston sports authority, will remain intact under his ownership. crane, who founded a houston-based logistics company in 2008, is also the chairman and chief executive of crane capital, a private equity fund company. in 2009, he was in the running to buy the cubs and last summer teamed with dallas mavericks owner mark cuban in an
