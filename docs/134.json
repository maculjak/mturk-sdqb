i say,\" yes, it is contrary to rome's teachings .' but it is not contrary to my own conscience, \"she said. kicanas said the bishops are being invited to pay for the study, but it is not required. he doesn't know if they will help with the cost. the diocese of tucson filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004. the nun study was announced last january and written portions were due last week. next, there will be on-site visitations to some congregations. a vatican-approved web site on the study (www.apostolic visitation.org) includes information from cardinal <mark>franc rode</mark> on the reasons for the study.\" like other vocations in the church, religious life has passed through challenging times, \"<mark>rode</mark> wrote.\" apostolic works have also changed significantly because of societal changes. these and other areas need to be better understood and assessed in order to safeguard and promote consecrated life in the united states. \"kicanas said people often react to inquiries like this with fear.\" there's always a level of trepidation that comes with a review and yet it has always been extremely beneficial, \"he said.\" i think our religious communities will have an opportunity, through this study, to identify the significant contributions they have made to the mission of the church. \"laurie olson, a local member of call to action, a national catholic reform movement, said other vatican studies have been conducted following a crisis or scandal, which is not the case this time.\" one can only conclude it's an attack on the sisters, that they are trying to rein them in in some fashion, \"she said.\" it seems to be the pattern of the hierarchy, to attack and further diminish the role of women in the church. \"sister rina cappellazzo, the tucson diocese's vicar for religious, said the study is a chance to look at all the contributions nuns are making, and how things can be done better in the future.\" it's another review of who we are, what we do and why we do it, \"she said.\" after any kind of study, there is a new direction, a clarified vision and sometimes you take a new direction. \"she hopes the study will help attract more women to religious life. there are 194 sisters in the diocese of tucson.\" one of the things that we're hoping is that women will look at this and say, \"this is what i want to join. i want to be a part of this,'\" she said."}, {"articleID": "2019030420_00016431_W", "names": {"Andy Mcdonald": ["Q23011622", "Q4761018", "Q526689"], "Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2019-03-04", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/chris-grayling-accused-running-scared-14086903", "content": "Get the biggest politics stories by email Subscribe See our privacy notice More newsletters Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Chris Grayling was accused by Labour of running scared after the government sent the Health Secretary Matt Hancock to answer an urgent question on the pay out to Eurotunnel.

His disregard for taxpayers in this House is clear. \"He added:\" Even in this golden age of ministerial incompetence, the Transport Secretary stands out from the crowd. He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, causing chaos and wasting billions of pounds yet he shows no contrition, no acknowledgement of his mistakes nor any resolve to learn and improve. \"He's now ridiculed in the New York Times, the mayor of Calais has banned him from his town - the Transport Secretary has become an international embarrassment.\" Mr <mark>McDonald</mark> went on: \"The Prime Minister is the only person in the country who retains confidence in this failing Transport Secretary and only does so because of her own political weakness.\" The public deserve to know how many more calamities is the Prime Minister prepared to tolerate and how many more billions of pounds will she allow him to waste before saying enough is enough.

After sealing World Cup qualification against Slovenia this time last year, the 48-year-old moved to a three-man defence that had its kinks but provided the platform for a summer to remember. Southgate ended a run of 16 matches using that defensive structure on Friday as England reverted to a four-man backline against the side that halted their progress at the semi-final stage in Russia, where Croatia's midfield ran amok as they came back to secure a 2-1 extra-time win. Thanks to everyone supporting us from afar. See you in Seville .?? #threelions pic.twitter.com/EOgBKHeDcO--England (@ England) October 12, 2018 But, just 93 days on, England managed to nullify that threat, with their re-shaped defence working well as the side began to threaten from open play in a Nations League encounter that should have been an away win rather than a 0-0 draw. \"In the last few matches, we have been pinned back in different ways,\" Southgate said after a match played behind closed doors. \"With three opponents pinning our five back--against Spain that was the two wingers and centre forward, against Switzerland that was the wing-backs--so we were then getting outnumbered without the ball.\" We'd also had some problems building up against the pressure, so tonight I was really pleased that we did both things very well. \"We were able to get more pressure higher up the pitch, we were able to get tighter to their midfielder. I thought our three midfield players did an excellent job.\" We used the ball well against a very good team, so very pleased with it. The players adapted quickly and well. \"The three at the back, the 3-5-2, allowed some players to bed into international football. People like (<mark>Harry</mark>) Maguire.\" Going into the World Cup, I felt we needed a little bit more protection for the defence and the opportunity to get two forwards in the game. \"Now, I think some of those players are a bit more established. They look very comfortable as a back four.\" So, I think that gives us good opportunities because some of the players that we've got coming through--we've got some very strong No. 8s and wingers coming through the system--so it's good that we have got the opportunity to play different systems. \"Jordan Henderson (left) and John Stones are suspended for the clash with Spain (Adam Davy/PA) Southgate now has to decide whether to stick or twist against a Spain side that mauled Croatia 6-0 after winning the Nations League opener 2-1 at Wembley last month. Luke Shaw, Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli all started that game but miss the Group A4 rematch through injury, while John Stones and Jordan Henderson are suspended in Seville after picking up bookings on Friday.\" Well, it doesn't make life any easier! \"Southgate said with a smile.\" But there's opportunities for other players. \"It's going to be a really good test for us in Seville. We'll have thousands of fans there, so we want to give another good performance.\" These players give absolutely everything. I could never, ever question their commitment or the intensity of their game. The youngest player in 63 years to make a competitive debut for @ England.

He shoos them with the pistol he holds in his right hand, and flicks out his left hand as he approaches the prisoner standing before him. His men guess what's coming, and scatter. The general raises the shiny snub-nose .38, points it at the prisoner's right temple and pulls the trigger. At that instant on the sunny Thursday of Feb. 1, 1968, in what was then called Saigon, Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams' camera shutter clicked once and one of the most powerful pictures of the Vietnam War, or any war, was taken. In 1/500th of a second, Adams caught the moment the bullet crashed through the Viet Cong prisoner's skull at about 600 mph, distorting his face, tousling his hair and shoving his head off center. Some people say you can see the bullet coming out the other side. Adams thought it was still inside. It's hard to tell. In the picture, Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan, the head of South Vietnam's National Police, stares coldly at his victim. Loan, who had a reputation as a government enforcer, is a thin man with a receding hairline who seems to be wearing a bulky flak vest. His shirt sleeves are rolled up, showing the sinews in his forearm. The gun looks like it has recoiled slightly upward. Off to the left in the frame, another soldier winces. The prisoner, whose hands are bound behind him, already has a fat lip, likely acquired when he was captured after leading a brutal commando raid. He wears dark shorts, a plaid shirt and no shoes. On film footage of the incident, the shooting scene unfolds in about 10 seconds. (Adams can be seen for an instant in an earlier part of the footage .) The prisoner, Viet Cong officer Nguyen Van Lem, tumbles to the pavement, blood spouting from his head. Loan calmly holsters his pistol, saying to Adams, \"they killed many of my men and many of your people,\" and walks away. Adams waits until the blood stops gushing. \"It was gross,\" he would say later. He takes a few more pictures of the body then returns to the Associated Press office to drop off his film. No big deal. \"I thought absolutely nothing of it,\" he said in an interview that later became part of a Newseum podcast. \"I said' I think I got some guy shooting somebody .' And, uh, I went to lunch.\" Just another day on the bloody streets of Saigon in the midst of the enemy's famous Tet offensive - sweeping guerrilla attacks across South Vietnam - during the endless Vietnam War. \"So what?\" Adams, a former U.S. Marine from a small town north of Pittsburgh, said later. \"It was a war. I'm serious. That's how I felt. I had seen so many people die at that point in my life.\" Adams did not realize he had taken one of history's great pictures. He did not know it was a shot that would summarize in a millisecond the savage, seemingly mindless, violence of the war. He had no idea that his photograph, snapped 50 years ago Thursday, would help change history, and echo throughout his life and that of his surviving subject. \"He wasn't allowed to forget that photograph,\" Loan's son, August, said in a 2008 documentary. \"It stuck with him everywhere he went.\" The picture ran on the front pages of many U.S. newspapers and the footage ran on TV. But it was the photograph, and its frozen portrait of agony, that fueled the antiwar movement and helped end U.S. involvement. \"It just kind of summed up the whole war,\" former CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer said in the short film \"Eddie Adams: Saigon' 68\" by <mark>Douglas Sloan</mark>. \"The horrificness of it stops you,\" the late Life Magazine photographer Bill Eppridge said in the 20128 documentary. \"I think his picture was the moment that changed the war.\" David Hume Kennerly, a fellow Vietnam War photographer, who was the former chief White House photographer and a friend of Adams's, compared the picture with that of <mark>Joe Rosenthal</mark>'s famous shot of U.S. Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima in World War II. \"Where <mark>Joe Rosenthal</mark>'s picture represented the heroism...and courage in war and patriotism...Eddie's picture was exactly the opposite,\" Kennerly said in a telephone interview. \"Eddie's picture was the real underbelly of violence and summary execution...It's what war is really like.\" \"I don't know that it ended the Vietnam War, but it sure as hell didn't help the cause for the government,\" he said. \"One thing I know for sure, anybody who's ever seen that photo has never forgotten it.\" In 1969, Adams was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for the shot. But he felt terrible about the photo, which he didn't think was that good, and bitter about the prize, according to interviews he gave over the years. He believed he had taken far more worthy pictures, and that the execution photo was viewed out of context by most people: The slain Viet Cong prisoner was suspected in the murder of a South Vietnamese officer, his wife and children. Adams believed he had destroyed Gen. Loan's life. \"Two people died in that photograph,\" Adams wrote in Time magazine years later. \"The recipient of the bullet and General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera.\" \"General Loan was...a real warrior,\" Adams wrote in a Time eulogy for Loan. \"I'm not saying what he did was right, but you have to put yourself in his position...He never blamed me. He told me if I hadn't taken the picture, someone else would have, but I've felt bad for him and his family for a long time.\" Loan, who later lost a leg in combat, was treated for the injury at Washington's old Walter Reed Army Hospital in 1969, which outraged some people. The late Sen. <mark>Stephen Young</mark>, D-Ohio, called Loan a \"brutal murderer,\" and his treatment in the U.S. \"a disgraceful end to a...disgraceful episode.\" Loan was university-educated and had become a jet pilot before he was named national police chief. He was married and had five children. After the war, he made his way with his family to the United States and ran a restaurant in northern Virginia. But the photograph stalked him. In the restaurant men's room, someone scrawled on the wall: \"We know who you are, you f--\"In 1976, he told a Washington Post reporter he was trying\" to think about the present and the future of my children. I have no time to think back or regrets. \"In 1978, the government moved to deport him.\" Gen Loan cold-bloodedly shot and killed another human being, \"former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y., wrote at the time.\" By any standard what he did was immoral. \"But Loan had local support and was never deported. Twenty years later, on July 14, 1998, he died at home in Burke, Virginia, at the age of 67. Adams, a rough-edged, cantankerous figure who had great fame after the war, also was haunted by the photo, among other things. In the documentary, he said that when he died he wanted to be buried in his Marine Corps\" dress blues \"uniform. He wanted a 35mm camera with a wide-angle lens, and he wanted some slow speed color film.\" Because where I go there's going to be a lot of light, \"he said.\" And it (won't be) from up above either. Fire, you can photograph really well with a slow speed film. \"Adams died of Lou Gehrig's disease on Sept. 18, 2004, in New York City. He was 71. He was laid to rest beside his father just outside his home town of New Kensington, Pa.. He didn't fit into his old uniform, his widow, Alyssa, said. But she did bury him with a camera. --"}, {"articleID": "2010111411_00033750_W", "names": {"Ryan Jackson": ["Q43084035", "Q493427", "Q7384176", "Q7384177", "Q7384178"]}, "date": "2010-11-14", "url": "http://callofduty.wikia.com/index.php?title=Grigori_Weaver&diff=657139&oldid=prev", "content": "** according to <mark>ryan jackson</mark>'s emails, weaver approached <mark>jackson</mark> shortly after x tipped him, to ask his help to dig up what info can be found for kristina; but <mark>jackson</mark>'s superior, richard kain, told <mark>jackson</mark> to feed weaver whatever \"to get him off his back\" . ** according to <mark>ryan jackson</mark>'s emails, weaver approached <mark>jackson</mark> shortly after x tipped him, to ask his help to dig up what info can be found for kristina; but <mark>jackson</mark>'s superior, richard kain, told <mark>jackson</mark> to feed weaver whatever \"to get him off his back\" . ** the arctic black ops multiplayer character is similar to weaver. ** the arctic black ops multiplayer character is similar to weaver. + ** even though weaver lost his eye earlier, in the \"safe\" house at the start of wmd he subdues a guard and then shoots another guard in the head without looking. ** his signature weapon appears to be an aug. be advised, you will not be at a safe distance in the event that spoiler goes off, do you understand? warning! this article contains spoilers and/or leaked info studies and observation group and is a part of a squad (with the playable character) infiltrating a soviet base during the mission \"hudson, as they torture dr. clarke. he loses one of his eyes during the mission alex mason. according to weaver's cia dossier, weaver was born in russia in 11/10/1936, his father was a local political figure who was executed during stalin's great purge, he and his mother defected to the us during ww2. after the baikonur mission, weaver developed a comradeship bond with woods and mason, for saving his life. however, mason's deteriorating mental condition has caused rift in the friendship, from worry to mistrust, and by february 1968, weaver was convinced that mason is burnt during the latter's days in vorkuta, and advised to hudson once they got the info they need, they should deal with mason as in\" two in the chest, one in the head \". throwing knife on an enemy. this is the first confirmed npc to use (and kill with) the throwing knife. it is also the only time a throwing knife is actually seen in call of duty: black ops, as it has been replaced by the tomahawk. it should be noted that after weaver's eye is cut out, there is no effect on his aim. he should have had a problem with depth perception, going back to the fact that he had lost his eye. gamescom demonstration (including the gamestop commercial), weaver is seen wearing an eye patch.
