The Wall Street Journal said the White House had informed officials in Beijing that it would go ahead with a summit meeting in Buenos Aires. It cited unnamed sources from both sides. There was no immediate word from Chinese officials in Beijing. The aim was to find a way out of the impasse over trade that has led both countries to impose penalty tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's exports. Strong Chinese export data also helped breathe life into share benchmarks that had languished in recent days. Defying tariffs, China's trade surplus with the United States grew to a record $34.1 billion in September, customs data showed. This marked a jump of 13 percent over a year earlier. Its exports to the United States rose to $46.7 billion although growth was slower than in August. Imports of U.S. goods grew too, but at a slower pace than before. On the overall, China's global exports picked up and its imports steadily increased. Asia's rebound followed another rout Thursday on Wall Street, where indexes tumbled for a second straight day on worries that rising interest rates and trade tensions could hurt global growth. \"It seems Asia has had a reassessment, and calmer heads have prevailed as we close out the week,\" <mark>Chris Weston</mark> of Pepperstone Group Limited said in a commentary. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.5 percent Friday to 22,694.66 after sinking early in the day following a nearly 4 percent loss on Thursday. Australia's S & P ASX 200 rose 0.2 percent to 5,895.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 1.8 percent to 25,726.78. The Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.9 percent to 2,606.91. Shares rallied in Taiwan and rose throughout Southeast Asia. A decline in the yield on 10-year Treasury yields hit bank stocks, while technology and retail companies stumbled. The benchmark S & P 500 index started the day with gains, but ended losing 2.1 percent to 2,728.37, its lowest close in three months and sixth straight loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1 percent to 25,052.83 and the Nasdaq composite gave up 1.3 percent to 7,329.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 1.9 percent to 1,545.38. The U.S. Treasury will soon release a currency report that some analysts suggest might change the official stance on China's exchange rate policy. Reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was advised against labeling China as a currency manipulator--a status that could trigger penalties--have eased tensions, Stephen Innes of OANDA said. Despite \"a semblance of sanity returning,\" the markets are ultimately \"not out of the weeds,\" he added. Officials at the IMF-World Bank annual meeting, held on the Indonesian island of Bali this week, have called on the U.S. and China to work out their dispute over technology while abiding by world trade rules. On Friday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo alluded the tensions to popular TV series \"Game of Thrones\". He said fighting among the \"great houses\" was distracting them from the threat of an \"evil winter .\" \"Victory or defeat in wars always brings the same result--destruction,\" Widodo said. In other trading, U.S. crude oil added 84 cents to $71.81. The contract dropped 3 percent to close at $70.97 in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, was $1 higher at $81.26. It dropped 3.4 percent to $80.26 in London. The dollar strengthened to 112.40 yen from 112.13 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1598 from $1.1586. Wall Street was set for an optimistic open. S & P 500 futures rebounded 1.3 percent to 2,781.50. Dow futures was 1.2 percent higher at 25,494.00. \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

The projects being supported include those involving renewable energy, rainforest protection and reforestation. British Airways's parent company IAG has also committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

EFE/File London, Jan 5 (EFE). - Buckingham Palace, the British Royal Family's official residence, asserted Monday that Queen Elizabeth II never had any acquaintance or contact with the woman that filed a lawsuit accusing her son, Prince Andrew, of sexually abusing her while she was still a minor. Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is at the center of controversy after the press revealed that his name appears in a U.S. lawsuit against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, which includes accusations by a woman claiming she was forced to have sex with the queen's third son when she was just 17 years old. U.K. media identified the woman as Virginia Roberts, whose father, Sky Roberts, told the tabloid \"Daily Mail\" that his daughter mentioned her acquaintance with Prince Andrew a few years ago, when she was living in London. She also told him that she had met the Queen during her stay in the British capital. However, a Buckingham Palace spokesman insisted that there is no evidence suggesting that these statements are true, especially since the Royal Palace does not have any record of the alleged meetings. Buckingham Palace recently denied that Prince Andrew was involved in any kind of relationship with Roberts while insisting that her allegations \"are false and without foundation .\" The name of Prince Andrew, 54, was mentioned in documents filed in a Florida court during the Jeffrey Epstein trial, in which Virginia Roberts accused him of forcing her to have sex with the Duke of York three times (in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein) between 1999 and 2002, according to U.K. media. Roberts claimed that Epstein, Prince Andrew's personal friend who was sentenced in 2008 to a year and a half in prison for sex with minors, loaned her to \"rich and powerful friends\" as a \"sex slave .\" The Metropolitan Police Service noted that it has not received any notification regarding this case until now, but assured it will start an investigation once an official report is filed. Prince Andrew, one of the Royal Family's most controversial members, stepped down in 2011 from his position as special representative tasked with attracting foreign investment to Britain after his friendship with Epstein was revealed.

Hillier crushed a drive and stuck a 4-iron to 6 feet on the 575-yard 18th hole, which runs alongside Lake Louise. He made the putt for an eagle. And shot 81. \"Kind of like making a 3 at the buzzer when you're down four, isn't it?\" sixth-year Kansas coach Jamie Bermel said. \"Didn't really matter. That's about the way our day went too .\" Precisely. When the Jayhawks walked off the course, they were in dead last, 21 over par, in the field of 30 schools with a chance of moving up because some schools were just getting started. Friday's rain delay forced KU to play one-and-a-half rounds Saturday. The players started teeing off at 7 a.m. after finishing past 8:30 p.m. Friday. The difficulty of the course, the short turnaround, the searing heat and the enormity of the stage combined to make this not just another Saturday on the golf course for the Jayhawks. So far, KU's two seniors have handled it the best. Daniel Sutton, the team's straightest driver, has shot 71-73 to enter Sunday's round at even par. Daniel Hudson shot 76-72 and is 4 over, battling back from a triple-bogey 7 on his first hole of the tournament, No. 10 on Friday. Sophomore Andy Spencer (72-78) is 6 over. Harry Hillier (76-81) is 13 over, junior Charlie Hillier 82-79) 17 over. After Sunday's round, the field will be trimmed to 15 schools and the eight best of those after Monday will advance to match play. Do you believe in miracles? KU has so much ground left to make up, which in many instances would mean taking more chances is the way to go, but Karsten Creek counterpunches so viciously that might not be wise. \"I just don't know if you can be real aggressive out here because you're going to get punched in the nose if you get overly aggressive,\" Kansas coach Jamie Bermel said. \"The holes where we made big numbers on, a lot of the guys hit 3-woods and couldn't keep it in play. That part of it we just have to get better at. A lot of courses we play you can hit a driver and if it goes wayward you can still find it. Not out here .\" Sutton, who came to KU from Birmingham, England, wants to go out in style. \"For me and Hud, potentially it can be our last round of college golf,\" Sutton said. \"We're going to give it our all .\" Sutton has no ambivalence about the approach with the team so far behind. \"Same as always,\" he said. \"We're going to keep it in the fairway. If the putts start to fall and and a bunch of us start making birdies, you never know what can happen. We just need to stick to the game plan of hitting it in the fairway, post a respectable score and see where that leaves us .\" Kansas is one of seven Big 12 schools competing. Texas Tech (-5), Oklahoma State (-4), Oklahoma (+2), Texas (+4) need to hold their positions in the field to make the first cut. Baylor (+21) is just two strokes ahead of Kansas, and Iowa State, which teed off later than the rest of the Big 12 schools, hovered right around the cut line in the early going of its second round. Hudson did a nice job of capturing what makes Karsten Creek such a difficult challenge to negotiate. \"You can hit good shots off the tee and you have to aim to where the wind's going to push the ball to the fat part of the fairway,\" Hudson said. \"And that's if you're comfortable over the shot. But if you don't feel like you have a consistent flight off the tee, you're standing up there on a hole that's 40 yards wide and if you don't hit it in that 40-yard gap, you're re-teeing .\" KU's second round was marred by four triple-bogeys and two doubles.
