cup slivered almonds? cup chopped dried apricots 1 tsp. salt? tsp. cayenne pepper? cup whipping cream 4 bay leaves steps: pre-heat oven to 350. lightly oil a 9x13 baking dish. in a large bowl stir together the breadcrumbs, milk and 1 egg. set the bowl aside. in a medium saut? pan or skillet melt the butter over medium heat. add the ground beef, onion and pear and cook 10 minutes. stir in the garlic, curry powder, lemon zest, lemon juice, almonds, apricots, salt and cayenne pepper and cook 5 minutes. remove the pan from the heat. spoon the meat mixture into the breadcrumbs and combine. spoon the beef into the prepared baking dish and lay the bay leaves atop. in a medium bowl whisk together the remaining eggs and cream until smooth. pour this mixture over the meat. place in oven and bake 50 minutes before serving. ** inside google calls chef <mark>larry edwards</mark> \"quite possibly the most popular chef in the world\" and now you can find out what chef <mark>larry edwards</mark> has coming up in the kitchen, on the road, in the restaurants and in the media by joining him on facebook where the chef's snarky personality and often controversial comments are always sure to cause a stir!", "articleID": "2011123017_00011822_W", "names": {"Larry Edwards": ["Q27830862", "Q6490247"]}}, {"date": "2011-12-31", "url": "http://registerguard.com/web/sports/27393145-41/ppg-washington-game-rpg-huskies.html.csp", "content": "contain tony wroten and duck men's basketball just might ruin dawgs' day <mark>bob clark</mark> the register-guard (friday, dec 30, 2011 11:18 pm) today seattle - all oregon needs to worry about tonight is avoiding turnovers, keeping washington at bay on the boards, dealing with the usual frenetic pace of the huskies and, oh, yeah, defending the pac-12's best freshman. in other words, it's a lot of the usual problems when going against washington, with the presence of tony wroten added in. \"he's an awfully good player,\" uo coach dana altman said of the uw freshman. \"he's very athletic and has good instincts .? he scores a lot of baskets .\" the 6-foot-5 wroten scored 26 points, led the huskies with nine rebounds and had four assists in washington's 95-80 win over oregon state on thursday. after entering the game with the most turnovers in the pac-12, he committed only two in 32 minutes as his game settled down. though he has started only the past four games, wroten has scored at least 23 points in three of them, raising his season average to 16.8 points. that ranks him atop the pac-12 among all players, and fifth in the nation among freshmen. certainly there are other issues for the ducks (10-3, 1-0) as they attempt to open the pac-12 schedule with a sweep after thursday's 92-75 win over washington state. there is, for instance, the fact the huskies (7-5, 1-0) lead the pac-12 in offensive rebounds, with 14.2 per game. who wants to give this team that many extra chances at scoring? the huskies do that anyway by forcing about 14 turnovers by opponents. oregon had a solid rebounding game against wsu with a positive margin of 12 in rebounds, but even there, the ducks had 17 turnovers. and the cougars aren't the match for the huskies in putting pressure on ballhandlers. \"we don't want to give up easy baskets because they're going to score enough as it is,\" altman said. \"we've got to handle the ball and not turn it over? (and) stay with them on the boards .\" oregon isn't about to suddenly turn into a team that runs a slowdown offense, but altman would prefer the game not be played at the huskies' pace. too many teams can get drawn into playing out of control by washington, and then find themselves playing catch-up. \"i don't think it'll be a low-scoring game but i don't think we want it in the 90s,\" altman said. washington's task will be to force its favored tempo on oregon. as he previewed the game friday afternoon, uw coach lorenzo romar spoke of the \"efficiency\" with which the ducks ran their offense in the win over wsu, leading to oregon's shooting a season-high .694 percentage from the field. \"they've got a lot of experience on that team and they played like that on the road,\" romar said. \"you can't fall asleep (defensively)? when you make a mistake, mark it in your book, they're going to score .\" uo sophomore guard johnathan loyd has a sore thigh after taking a knee to that area in thursday's game. \"he's hobbling around a little bit, but i think he's ok,\" altman said. back to form use the below form to e-mail this story to your friends. notice: you must have javascript enabled to use this form. attention: * indicates a required field. contain tony wroten and duck men's basketball just might ruin dawgs' day | a lucky survivor | a eugene man feels fortunate for his timely heart treatment every time 61-year-old charles mestrich jr. hears about another young athlete who suddenly collapsed and died, and the autopsy reveals hypertrophic cardio? myopathy, he has two? from pigskin to picasso | if you go for football, take in some more refined pursuits, too pasadena, calif. - there's more to pasadena than the annual tournament of roses, with its spectacular new year's parade and rose bowl game. this city? some like it hot | an abundance of nearby hot springs heat up winter's chill blue river - soaking in a hot spring of volcanically heated mineral water in the midst of a northwest rainforest is one of life's finest? dreams of snow | even under dry skies, the right meals can be winter wonders rose bowl: bcs moment to call his own still dogging lamichael james rose bowl: lamichael james healthy, unafraid (maybe) going into game guest viewpoint: sexual harassment is an epidemic in the school system with <mark>bob clark</mark> last activity: 5 hours ago with rob moseley last activity: 6 hours ago with reidun craig last activity: 1 day ago with rob moseley last activity: 1 day ago get the print version of the register-guard on your computer, ipad or e-reader. it's convenient get 24-hour access to the register-guard anywhere you have a computer and internet access. available by 6 a.m. every morning. easy to use enlarge photos and stories. save, print and email articles or advertisements. searchable search and access past issues. 2011 oregon football app: just $3.99 for the 2011 season!
