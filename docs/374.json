He was hurt in the second period when Pittsburgh Penguins' Phil Kessel shot the puck. Coach John Tortorella told reporters Monday that Werenski is done for the season. That's the way it happens after a loss. After a lackluster performance in a 3-1 loss in Game 3, the Rangers came out aggressive early in Game 4. \"I said to him,\" I'm proud to be your teammate \". The Blue Jackets have benefitted greatly from his services this year, and losing him is arguably one of the biggest blows they could suffer in the postseason. Nutivaara, a rookie, was making his playoff debut. It helped. They were able to maintain pressure pretty much all evening, and while the Penguins had their moments, they never seized momentum in the second and third periods the way they did in the first three games of the series .\" No matter what period we're in, we have to have the puck more \", Tortorella said .\" We just got to keep doing it \". He'll walk away from his rookie campaign with 11 goals and 47 points in 78 regular season games, good for sixth in scoring on the team and first among blue liners. BOSTON (AP) - <mark>Bobby Ryan</mark> scored on a tip-in on a power play 5:43 into overtime, and the Ottawa Senators recovered after giving up a three-goal lead to beat the Boston Bruins to take a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. Veteran goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, replacing injured starter <mark>Matt Murray</mark>, has been sharp for the Penguins and made a critical mask save of a potential game-winning Brandon Dubinsky shot in overtime Sunday. Corey Perry scored 1:30 into overtime and Anaheim rallied from three goals down to take a 3-0 series lead in the first-round series .\" When they get closer, we end up with a shift and score a goal \". They lost that series in seven games to Vancouver. The Blue Jackets will be seeing some changes in their lineup. There was less luck involved when Anderson made it 2-0 with a little over minute left in the period. He was waiting to the right of the net to collect a rebound on a shot by Jenner and beat Fleury to the glove side. But Kuhnhackl found the back of the net on a rebound less than two minutes later to make it 4-3 before Jenner put Columbus back up by two. The Pittsburgh Penguins will be looking to go with what worked, keeping most of their lines in tact for game four. Even when they would win series, they would too often leave the door open for opponents or let series go an extra game or two.

Not since John F.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) More WASHINGTON (AP)--Not since John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Bobby to be attorney general and his brother-in-law as director of the Peace Corps has a president leaned so heavily on his family. Even <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s 5-year-old granddaughter Arabella has pitched in. As the administration nears its 100-day mark, Trump has established a White House operation with such an unusual commingling of blood, business and government that it has surprised even his own family. Ivanka Trump, who once said she'd stick to the role of daughter, now has a West Wing office and the title of assistant to the president after she discovered that \"having one foot in and one foot out wouldn't work .\" Her effort to walk a fine line has not always been easy. During an appearance Tuesday at a women's empowerment conference in Germany, she drew hisses and groans as she defended her father's track record. Her husband Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to the president with a bulging and growing portfolio that includes everything from brokering Mideast peace to restructuring the federal government. And there was the president's son Eric, in the unofficial role of spokesman, declaring his father would stand up to North Korea's provocations. In an interview, at the White House Easter egg roll no less, saying on behalf of the president: \"You don't want there to be death and destruction and turmoil around the world but, again, you have to have massive backbone when it comes to dealing with awful, awful dictators .\" Another Trump son, Don Jr., enhanced his profile during the campaign and early months of his father's presidency to such an extent that there is speculation he'll make his own run for office. And he's leaving that door open, saying the New York governor's seat could be a tempting destination at some point. The president's wife, Melania, meanwhile, has been a largely distant presence so far, remaining in New York for the most part while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes out the school year. But she is gradually spending more time in Washington and did give her husband a gentle nudge to put his hand on his heart during the playing of the national anthem at the Easter egg roll. Little Arabella chimed in to the Trump team effort by charming Chinese President Xi Jinping by singing a tune in Mandarin during the leaders' recent meeting at Mar-a-Lago. There are both pros and cons in staffing up from within one's own family, as Trump is learning. The family dynamic has added extra intrigue to the jockeying between rival power centers that is typical in the early days of any White House. The more moderate contingent led by Kushner and Ivanka Trump appears to be ascendant in recent days over those allied with senior strategist Steve Bannon, the former media executive and radio host who's a favorite of conservatives. Princeton historian Julian Zelizer says family members may be able to give a president a tough assessment that other staff members would shrink from providing, but they also can become \"so enmeshed in the identity of their family and protecting their father that they can't give honest advice or can't even see problems as they emerge .\" Ivanka Trump has been criticized for not speaking out more forcefully when she disagrees with her father. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's not making her views heard. \"I would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,\" she said earlier this month. During her appearance this week in Berlin, she said she's still \"rather unfamiliar\" with her new role as first daughter and presidential adviser but hopes to bring advice and feedback \"back to both my father and the president--and hopefully that will bring about incremental, positive change .\" Her husband, meanwhile, has traveled to Iraq with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and has been advising the president on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. The extent of Ivanka Trump's sway with her father is suggested by Eric Trump's recent comment that she likely weighed in before the president decided to bomb Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. Eric Trump told London's Daily Telegraph: \"She has influence. I'm sure she said,\" Listen, this is horrible stuff .' \"The blurry line between the Trump family's business interests and its government connections is another unusual complication of this presidency. Even with sons Don Jr. and Eric tasked with running the Trump businesses while Kushner and Ivanka Trump tend to government affairs, the continuing public-private overlap has generated lots of questions about conflicts of interest. Read More The separation between business and government is\" totally artificial, \"says Zelizer. Eric Trump's admission to Forbes magazine in February that\" nepotism is kind of a factor of life \"in the Trump family didn't help dispel the impression of an insider's clan, although he stressed that\" if we didn't do a good job, if we weren't competent, believe me, we wouldn't be in this spot. \"For all the questions about Trump's reliance on family, some see it as a net positive. The value of having a son or daughter on the inside\" is honesty and love, \"says former George H.W. Bush administration staffer Doug Wead, author of books on presidential children and the 2016 campaign .\" They care if your shirt-tail is hanging out. If your hair is messed up, they'll tell you. When everybody else is trying to hide from you, they're going to let you know. \"The power--and peril--of Kushner's place in Trump World is hinted at by Washington graybeard Henry Kissinger in a write-up for Time's list of 100 most influential people. Kissinger said Kushner's broad education and business background\" should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun. \"___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http: //twitter.com/nbenac", "articleID": "2017042615_00037130_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}}, {"date": "2017-04-26", "url": "http://fmqb.com/article.asp?id=3027413", "content": "Cox Enterprises Names Alexander <mark>C.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, file) President Donald Trump's order for the government to review national monuments created by several of his predecessors sets up a legal showdown over whether one chief executive has the power to undo another's decisions. At stake are federal lands revered for their natural beauty and historical significance. The review goes well beyond a few declarations made in the waning months of Barack Obama's term. It covers 24 monuments established by three former presidents over more than two decades. A closer look at the issues: ___ WHAT IS A NATIONAL MONUMENT? The 1908 Antiquities Act, enacted under President Theodore Roosevelt, empowers the president to declare as national monuments any landmarks, structures and other \"objects of historic or scientific interest\" on land owned or controlled by the federal government. Roosevelt established 18 monuments, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona and Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Most presidents since then have designated additional monuments. Congress has created others. Most monuments are overseen by the National Park Service. Some are cared for by the federal Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service or the Forest Service. Each agency has policies for protecting the land while also allowing some public use. For instance, some policies include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles. ___ A CONTENTIOUS HISTORY Many national monument proclamations have enjoyed broad support. Others have been fiercely contested in Congress and the courts, including designations by Franklin D. Roosevelt (Jackson Hole National Monument, now Grand Teton National Park); <mark>Jimmy Carter</mark> (vast lands in Alaska); and George W. Bush (Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument northwest of Hawaii). Trump's choice of Jan. 1, 1996, as the starting date for his review was prompted by lingering resentment among Utah conservatives of Bill Clinton's designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that year. Critics say presidents increasingly are protecting areas that are too large and do not fit the law's original purpose of shielding particular historical or archaeological sites. Designating millions of acres for scientific observation or sheltering rare species, they contend, is a \"federal land grab\" that ignores the wishes of local residents, although the lands already belonged to the government or were under federal control. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says the pendulum has swung too far toward protecting public lands and away from the \"multiple-use\" concept advanced by Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the Forest Service and an early leader in the conservation movement. Supporters say the designations are essential to protect sensitive areas from looting and damage. Complaints about people getting kicked off the land are exaggerated, they say, and opposition fades as nearby communities benefit from tourism the monuments attract. A 2014 study by the nonprofit research group Headwaters Economics found that indicators such as employment, population and per-capita income held steady or improved in sections of the West where monuments larger than 10,000 acres had been established since 1981. ___ LEGAL PRINCIPLES Some monuments have been reduced in size over the years, either by presidential order or by Congress, while others have been enlarged. But no president has tried to eliminate a predecessor's monument. If Trump does so, his move will almost certainly be challenged in court. The Antiquities Act does not explicitly say whether a president can nullify a monument proclamation. A legal analysis commissioned by the National Parks Conservation Association says no, pointing to a 1938 opinion by then-Attorney General Homer Cummings that a monument designation has the force of law and can be reversed only by Congress. A House report accompanying the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 agrees. But a study for the conservative American Enterprise Institute released in March argues that when Congress authorizes the executive branch to write regulations, the power to repeal them generally can be assumed. That's especially so, it says, when a president is correcting a predecessor's act that exceeded what a law intended--such as creating vast monuments when the Antiquities Act says they should consist of \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected .\" ___ WHAT'S NEXT? Trump's order directs Zinke to review monument designations involving 100,000 acres or more. The interior secretary will submit an interim report within 45 days focusing on the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which Obama established last year. A final report is due in 120 days. Zinke says the report will recommend whether any monuments should be abolished or resized. He promises an open-minded approach and says he remains opposed to selling any federal land or transferring it to state or local control. Congress might weigh in as well. Numerous bills on the issue were introduced in the previous session, including measures to prevent the president from establishing or expanding monuments in particular states and to require consent of Congress or state legislatures.
