coming to nbc this fall, spent much of their time at television's summer press tour trying to shoot down what they say are false assumptions about the show. no, it's not a \"mad men\" clone, even if it does have a dapper don draper look-alike (eddie cibrian) at the center of its cast. also, it's not too raunchy for prime time, even though a conservative watchdog group has unleashed its wrath upon it. and, no, a show full of scantily clad \"bunnies\" being ogled by wolfish men is not demeaning to women. in fact, it's empowering. at least that's what they say. really. \"the show is all about empowerment and who these women can be, and how they can use the club to be anyone they want,\" producer chad hodge told critics. cast member naturi naughton echoed that sentiment. \"(the female characters) are smart, they're going to school, they're buying property--things they couldn't do at the time. they're using their resources,\" she said. as for racy material, producer ian biederman says the show is \"mild compared to a lot of things that are on television .\" those comments aren't likely to assuage the parents television council, which insists the show \"glorifies and glamorizes (an) insidious industry .\" nor will they change minds at nbc's salt lake city affiliate, which has chosen not to air it. chicago, follows a high-powered lawyer (cibrian) who frequents hugh hefner's glitzy club and becomes involved with a new playboy bunny (amber heard). in addition to all the cotton tails and cleavage, they've tossed in an outlandish crime plot to spice things up. based on an early look at the pilot, \"the playboy club\" isn't excessively edgy. and it's not nearly as compelling as abc's \"pan am,\" the season's other retro drama. still, it's clearly the kind of show ghat gets people talking--the kind of show that struggling nbc needs, according to the network's new entertainment boss <mark>robert greenblatt</mark>. \"what it has going for it is a recognizable brand that's automatically going to draw attention to it, good or bad,\" he said. \"...it's the right kind of thing for us to try .\" as for those comparisons to \"mad men,\" <mark>greenblatt</mark> simply waves them off. \"i have great respect for\" mad men,' but apart from the setting and period being similar, i think (it's) much more of an energized soap opera. \"not running dry: come this fall, millions of pbs viewers will want to raise a glass to filmmaker <mark>ken burns</mark>' latest project: a three-part documentary,\" prohibition. \"it arrives oct. 2--just a week after the season 2

on their hands in the mode of \"the sopranos,'\" he said. \"...americans always love to watch people who get to kill the people who (tick) them off and women who take their clothes off at the drop of a hat .\" as for his own work, <mark>burns</mark> said he has laid out a 10-year plan with films that include the history of the dust bowl; a look back at the infamous 1989 central park jogger assault and rape case; a 14-hour examination of the lives and legacies of theodore, franklin and eleanor roosevelt; a biography of <mark>jackie robinson</mark>; an extensive series on vietnam; the history of

week. their grand opening is set for noon wednesday. louis lee broke away from a meeting with the portland table tennis club to talk about red robe, a new tea shop that will hold its grand opening wednesday in an old town/chinatown neighborhood building owned by lee. the shop features about two dozen types of tea along with a short \"east-meets-west\" menu of items from bbq pork to eggs boiled in tea. \"a lot of unique thought has been put into this place,\" lee says. \"we're trying to find the formula for success in chinatown .\" the building, at the corner of northwest third avenue and the so-called davis festival street, is the former home of the oregon jewish museum. the small space was bisected into two smaller spaces last year. one became a travel agency. the corner unit was redesigned for the tea shop with new windows and limited outdoor seating by dao architecture and funding from the portland development commission. the grand opening is scheduled for noon wednesday. today, lee was meeting with the table tennis club, along with shop owners pearl zhang and raymond liu, to iron out details for a ping pong tournament planned to coincide with a neighborhood festival aug. 20. zhang and liu owned a chinese restaurant at northwest broadway and everett street until the mid 2000s (it's currently home to the gilt club). lee, a long time chinatown figure, was their accountant. after selling that restaurant, zhang and liu worked for panda express, helping pay their kids' way through college. view full size courtesy of dao architecture llc red robe before returning to chinatown, zhang and liu went to the tea shop in the lan su chinese garden, seeking permission to open their shop nearby. the tea shop's name comes from a rare variety of tea known as da hong pao (\"large red robe\" ). according to legend and wikipedia, a chinese emperor whose mother was healed by the tea had large red robes draped over the tea bushes. the shop will serve red robe tea, along with coffee and muffins in the mornings. in addition to the table tennis tournament, lee says the shop will serve as a mini community center. on aug. 27, lee says, a lawyer from the bureau of labor and industries will teach a class on oregon wage law in cantonese. zhang and liu are from guang zhou, and like lee, who hails from hong kong, speak cantonese. the shop will be open from about 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. most days, perhaps later on weekends to attract the late-night crowd (though alcohol is not on the menu, lee says).--<mark>michael russell</mark>", "articleID":

"t retirement august 04, 2011, 5:12 pm edt fragile economy keeps older workers from retirement for those in their 50s and early 60s the doubts start after opening the quarterly 401 (k) statement. the numbers look small following a decade of measly stock market returns and bear market devastations, including a fresh jolt on aug. 4, when the s & p 500 index swooned, extending the tumble from its peak in late april to 12 percent. two-year treasury note yields hit a record low, while the yield on one-month t-bills slipped into negative territory. taken together, the economic data are sending an aging, insecure workforce a clear message: don't retire yet. \"things are too uncertain,\" says richard v. burkhauser, economist and professor of policy analysis at cornell university. \"there's no way to protect yourself from all unexpected risks except not to retire .\" in the first half of 2011, the u.s. economy grew at a meager 0.8 percent annualized rate; investors appear increasingly nervous that a so-called double-dip recession is becoming more likely. those worries were exacerbated this week by the debt-ceiling accord reached in congress, which will seek $1.5 trillion in deficit cuts by year's end-a particularly rocky period for the recovery. the long-term trend toward a declining average age of retirement has reversed itself. the decline started in the 1880s and accelerated in the post world war ii era, falling for men from an average age of 70 in 1950 to 62 in 1985. yet since the mid-1980s increasing numbers of older men and women have kept working. the labor force participation rate for men age 65 has risen 43 percent over the past quarter century. for women 65 and older, the participation rate has nearly doubled over the same period, to 13.4 percent in june 2011. on the positive side working into the traditional retirement years allows savings to compound longer. workers are healthier and better educated than earlier generations, and it's easier to toil away in an economy dominated by high-tech gear rather than the assembly line. the financial payoff from staying on the job also comes from higher social security benefits. waiting to file until the full retirement age of 66 increases the benefit by at least a third, compared with taking social security at age 62. wait until age 70 to claim your first benefit check, and it's at least 75 percent larger. \"the era of earlier and earlier retirement is over, and it isn't coming back,\" says <mark>joseph quinn</mark>, an economist at boston college. sounds good. the flaw in the new job-tirement message is that america's great job machine is sputtering. the u.s. economy hasn't done well at creating jobs for young and old workers alike, let alone jobs with decent pay and benefits. even before the labor market trauma of the great recession, private sector job growth was the weakest in half a century during the business cycle expansion of the 2000s. it increased at an annual 0.6 percent rate, according to the economic policy institute, a shadow of the 1.8 percent annual rate of the '90s and the 2 percent yearly pace of the '80s. jobs remain scarce 26 months after the recession was declared officially over; the u.s. unemployment rate is at 9.2 percent. much of the work that's available doesn't pay well, and unlike their younger workmates, older workers have little time left to climb the corporate ladder of success (or at least get a pay raise). it's striking how many older workers are staying on the job. the labor force participation rate-the percentage of the working age population in the labor force-for most middle-aged and younger workers is down since the recession started in december 2007. the same isn't true for older workers. for instance, among men 55 and older, the labor force participation rate was 46.2 percent in june 2011, up from 45.4 percent in december 2007. the comparable figures for women were 34.6 percent and 33.7 percent, respectively.

possibility of an 11th hour change when revealing that o'gara must still undergo a late fitness test. the same applies to two others returning from injury but not named in the team--midfielder michael
