The scenarios will draw on intelligence reports of the latest threats from hackers in the criminal world, terrorists and rogue states .\" The UK is leading the world on this - it is groundbreaking stuff, \"said one person familiar with the process. As online threats race up national security agendas and governments look at ways of protecting their national infrastructures a cyber arms race is causing concern to the developed world The move comes amid heightened attention to online security amid widespread damage from the so-called Heartbleed bug, which has made parts of the web vulnerable to cyber criminals. American Funds, a large mutual fund provider, warned this month that its customers might be at risk from the bug. The UK programme will involve cyber specialists from companies officially approved to do\" penetration testing \", drawing on an industry certification scheme called Crest. The exercise, known as cyber threat and vulnerability management, is being overseen by Andrew Gracie, the director of the UK's special resolution unit within the BoE.

UK garment makers face skills shortage Many businesses conduct internal penetration testing but this is the first time that the authorities will oversee such a broad process, with the goal of rooting out vulnerabilities in computer infrastructure including the payment system. The BoE has conducted a pilot of the scheme, according to two people familiar with the process. Royal Bank of Scotland, leading insurers and financial infrastructure providers such as the London Stock Exchange. The BoE's Financial Policy Committee made cyber threats a key focus last year, recommending that the Treasury, Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority put in place a\" programme of work \"to test the system's resilience. The BoE declined to comment .\" It will be interesting how US and EU regulatory authorities respond, especially as the US followed the Waking Shark market-wide exercise with their own Quantum Dawn, \"said <mark>Steve Holt</mark>, a partner at Ernst & Young, the professional services firm. Concern about a possible state-sponsored attack on the City of London was heightened after last year's hacking of computer systems at South Korean broadcasters and banks, which originated from a Chinese internet address and was blamed by Seoul on North Korea. Financial Conduct Authority in its risk outlook for this year said it would work with the BoE and Treasury to test the resilience of the UK's critical national infrastructure to cyber attack.

While the White House says Obama has not approved military action inside Syria, additional intelligence on the militants would likely be necessary before he could take that step. Pentagon officials have been drafting potential options for the president, including airstrikes. One official said the administration has a need for reliable intelligence from Syria and called the surveillance flights an important avenue for obtaining data. Two U.S. officials said Monday that Obama had approved the flights, while another U.S. official said early Tuesday that they had begun. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter by name, and spoke only on condition of anonymity. The U.S. began launching strikes against the Islamic State inside Iraq earlier this month, with Obama citing the threat to American personnel in the country and a humanitarian crisis in the north as his rationale. Top Pentagon officials have said the only way the threat from the militants can be fully eliminated is to go after the group inside neighboring Syria as well. Obama has long resisted taking military action in Syria, a step that would plunge the U.S. into a country ravaged by an intractable civil war. However, the president's calculus appears to have shifted since the Islamic State announced last week that it had murdered American journalist <mark>James Foley</mark>, who was held hostage in Syria. The group is also threatening to kill other U.S. citizens being held by the extremists in Syria. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama has demonstrated his willingness to order military action when necessary to protect American citizens. \"That is true without regard to international boundaries,\" he said. The White House would not comment on Obama's decision to authorize surveillance flights over Syria. \"We're not going to comment on intelligence or operational issues, but as we've been saying, we'll use all the tools at our disposal,\" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. The U.S. had already stepped up its air surveillance of the Islamic State inside Iraq earlier this year as Obama began considering the prospect of airstrikes there. And the administration has run some surveillance missions over Syria, including ahead of an attempted mission to rescue <mark>Foley</mark> and other U.S. hostages earlier this summer. The U.S. special forces who were sent into Syria to carry out the rescue mission did not find the hostages at the location where the military thought they were being held. Officials who confirmed the failed rescue last week said the U.S. was continuing to seek out intelligence on the other hostages' whereabouts. Administration officials have said a concern for Obama in seeking to take out the Islamic State inside Syria is the prospect that such a move could unintentionally help embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. A top Syrian official said Monday any U.S. airstrikes without consent from Syria would be considered an aggression. The Islamic State is among the groups seeking Assad's ouster, along with rebel forces aided by the U.S.. The White House on Monday tried to tamp down the notion that action against the Islamic State could bolster Assad, with Earnest saying, \"We're not interested in trying to help the Assad regime .\" However, he acknowledged that \"there are a lot of cross pressures here .\" ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Everybody was left hanging with Monday's episode, so they want detailed Bachelor in Paradise spoilers regarding episode 5 airing on Aug. 26. What can everybody expect? There will be drama and romance to be sure, but apparently there are some other crazy things ahead as well. Fans would expect nothing less at this point. According to ABC executive <mark>Robert Mills</mark>, there are definitely juicy things ahead. He tweeted a spoiler teasing, \"PSA: there is a NEW #BachelorInParadise TONIGHT at 8 and - SPOILER ALERT - there will be vomit and a 3some .\" Here's hoping those two things aren't part of the same event. As it happens, the vomit teaser has already been explained via Reality Steve's spoilers. He indicates that the vomit is related to both the ambulance and the chase through the woods teased in spoiler previews. Steve says that Lacy Faddoul gets sick, and she runs into the woods as she's throwing up to get away from the cameras. Eventually an ambulance is brought in to help her, as it seems she has food poisoning or is dehydrated or something. She won't have to leave the show, however. As for the supposed threesome, Reality Steve's spoilers haven't broken down the fun on that one yet. Chances are fairly good that <mark>Mills</mark>' tease is a bit exaggerated, as surely Steve would have heard and shared if this was anything truly juicy. In fact, host <mark>Chris Harrison</mark> didn't even tease anything of this nature in his chat with Entertainment Weekly. He did point out that it may well be very telling that How will that all play out? It is said that Graham left because he was feeling sick, but he does return and accept AshLee's rose. <mark>Harrison</mark> does also tease Bachelor in Paradise spoilers that someone does leave Tuesday's episode in an ambulance, clearly Lacy if Reality Steve's spoilers are accurate, and <mark>Chris</mark> promises that \"It only gets better from here .\" Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary: London Rapper Identified As ISIS Militant Who Beheaded <mark>James Foley</mark> Whoopi Goldberg Reportedly Leaving \"The View' Due To Ongoing Feud With Rosie O'Donnell Royal Move: Take A Peek At Kate And William's Gorgeous New Residence [Photos] WWE News: The Original Plans For <mark>Brock Lesnar</mark> Heading Into SummerSlam Revealed WWE News: WWE Legend Superstar Billy Graham Says He Has Only 2 Years To Live", "articleID": "2014082700_00040908_W", "names": {"Brock Lesnar": ["Q220556", "Q25421397"], "Chris Harrison": ["Q19873951", "Q30602676", "Q3675503", "Q5106802", "Q5106804", "Q55362792"], "James Foley": ["Q1680393", "Q17562199", "Q721389"], "Mark Sanchez": ["Q15991558", "Q15991574", "Q6769581", "Q946184"], "Robert Mills": ["Q28180932", "Q7347693"]}}, {"date": "2014-08-27", "url": "http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2014/08/ethan_abbott_gmo_political_prisoner_harassment.php", "content": "Photo by Ambrose Cruz courtesy of March Against Monsanto Facebook/Occupy Denver Facebook A 2013 March Against Monsanto that Ethan Abbott helped to organize. Even his supporters admit that Ethan Abbott, the embattled natural farming activist who's been feuding with county authorities on several fronts, has a bit of a temper. But Abbott, 38, who was sentenced yesterday to ninety days in jail and eighteen months of probation in Weld County Court over a 2012 altercation with a neighbor, says that there's more to the case than his orneriness--that, in effect, he's the one being harassed and set up by influential people with ties to factory farming and fracking. It's an attitude that the judge who sentenced him finds disturbing. \"Mr. Abbott doesn't deal with conflict well,\" Judge <mark>John Briggs</mark> told the assembled at Abbott's tense sentencing hearing. \"The way that Mr. Abbott perceives things and reacts is not always consistent with reality .\" Denver's March Against Monsanto One of Ten Largest Worldwide, Organizer Says \"Abbott disagrees .\" I believe there's a lot more to this whole story than people are allowing me to bring out, \"he says. Some people who have worked with Abbott consider him to be a gifted and passionate, albeit volatile, proponent of natural farming. He's been heavily involved in the nonprofit Get To Know Your Farmer, which provides consultation and volunteer labor to help small, family-operated farms. He was an organizer of last fall's March Against Monsanto in Denver, hires the homeless to work on his farm projects, has been vocal in the fight against GMOs, and volunteered for the Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition and similar causes. But Abbott has also had some pungent disputes with other activists as well as landlords. A master plumber, his work as a handyman has been blasted on one website by dissatisfied customers. And he's been involved in a series of disconcerting confrontations with vendors, law enforcement, animal welfare inspectors, and others over his farming operations during the past few years, particularly in Weld County. Prosecutors say Abbott has been involved in thirty court cases over the past 23 years, facing charges ranging from making\" terrorist threats \"to obstruction, menacing, and harassment. His public defender says thirteen of those cases were traffic offenses and that eight others ended in his acquittal or dismissal of the charges--including a recent acquittal on animal cruelty charges. That still leaves three assault convictions as an adult and a pile of civil litigation across five counties. Yesterday's hearing was the result of events that unfolded nearly two years ago, when a woman named Ellen Kerbs, who lived a mile from Abbott's farm, stopped by to tell him that one of his calves was loose in the road. According to Krebs, Abbott bellowed at her, cursed her and punched out the back window of her vehicle, spraying glass and terrifying her five-year-old grandson, who was in the back seat .\" I went through the most horrifying, scary event of my lifetime, \"Kerbs told the court .\" I saw somebody who was totally unhinged, disturbed. \"Abbott admits yelling at Kerbs for ignoring his\" no trespassing \"signs and entering his house uninvited, but he denies punching out her window. He says she reversed her van into him while he was in the driveway trying to spot the calf, and that it was his head, not his arm, that went through the back window. He says he suffered injuries to his knee, back and head--and no marks on his hands--but sheriff's deputies declined to conduct an accident investigation and charged him instead. At trial his own attorney didn't produce any of his medical records, and the jury found him guilty of criminal mischief, harassment and reckless endangerment--all misdemeanors. Abbott's statement at sentencing seethed with his frustration at the way the case had been handled. He produced a small pill bottle containing glass fragments that he says were removed from his head .\" I've never gone looking for trouble, \"he told Judge <mark>Briggs</mark>.\" I just want to farm. I do feel that if I go to jail, I am a political prisoner. I believe I would be murdered. \"But <mark>Briggs</mark> wasn't moved by Abbott's claims that he'd been targeted for threats and persecution by the Weld County Sheriff's Office, calling it part of the defendant's\" break from reality. \"In addition to the jail time, he ordered a mental health assessment and anger management classes as conditions of Abbott's probation.", "articleID": "2014082801_00028072_W", "names": {"John Briggs": ["Q15497030", "Q4096455", "Q6223182"]}}, {"date": "2014-08-28", "url": "http://www.business2community.com/brandviews/getapp/seven-apps-help-profitably-extend-automate-sales-process-0990205", "content": "5 Reasons Mark Cuban's Cyber Dust App Is The Future Of Mobile Marketing Why You Shouldn't Give Your Social Media Audience the Content They Want Google's New Pigeon Algorithm: What Local Businesses Need to Know Discover The Power Within You: Storytelling and Content Marketing Seven Apps to Help You Profitably Extend and Automate Your Sales Process Your sales process calls for more steps than you might think.
