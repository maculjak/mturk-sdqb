weekend after 10 years of construction as the world's largest metropolis tackles traffic jams that slow vehicles to half of japan's average highway speed. the 2,618-meter (1.6-mile) bridge, whose nickname derives from its shape, will bring 19 billion yen ($246 million) in economic benefits a year as it almost halves journey times to container terminals in tokyo bay, the government estimates. built at an estimated cost of 113 billion yen, it's forecast to carry about 32,000 vehicles a day between eastern tokyo and a man-made island, where a new container terminal is being built. the four-lane bridge will be followed by a ring road and two larger loop lines around japan's capital. the improvements, spurred by the city's unsuccessful bid to host the 2016 olympics, are intended to cut traffic jams in and around the metropolis of more than 35 million people. \"the new bridge will ease congestion in the whole waterfront area,\" said shinichi ishii, a senior consultant for public management and strategy at nomura research institute inc. \"there is a premium on the value of time in the area, and the economic impact could be two or three times more than government estimates .\" population growth as migration from the countryside and smaller cities boosts tokyo's population, the city is increasing use of its waterfront by reclaiming land and building islands in tokyo bay. the three fastest-growing prefectures in japan from 2005 to 2010 were all in the greater tokyo region, led by tokyo prefecture, which increased its population 4.7 percent to 13.2 million, according to japan's statistics bureau. haneda airport, also built on reclaimed land in the bay, opened a fourth runway and started 24-hour operations in 2010. to expand container trade, japan has selected the port of tokyo, the nation's busiest cargo handler, along with nearby kawasaki and yokohama as the main focus for port investment in the region. the new container terminal being built on the man-made island will be able to handle ships capable of carrying 10,000 boxes, according to the port office, which is part of the national government's transport ministry. the tokyo gate bridge, as it is officially known, will shorten the travel time to the island from the city's shin-kiba district to 10 minutes from 19 minutes, according to the tokyo port office. it will also give truckers a choice of routes to the city's main aomi and oi container terminals. below cost the bridge, which weighs about 36,000 tons, was built for less than the original estimate of about 140 billion yen, thanks to new techniques and materials, said koki hosaka, a civil engineer at tokyo ports. it is built to withstand an earthquake directly under tokyo, he said. the height of the bridge was limited since it is on the approach to haneda airport, meaning that a suspension bridge wasn't an option, hosaka said. the construction also needed to be wide and high enough underneath for ships to pass, he said, leading to the final design that resembles two dinosaurs facing off. tokyo-based kawada industries inc. spent two years building the dinosaur-shaped trusses for the bridge, according to yoshifumi kodama, a manager for the project. the company used three cranes on boats to lay the bridge on the support columns, he said. \"nerve wracking'\" it hadn't been done for a bridge of this type in japan for 16 years, \"said kodama .\" it was very nerve wracking as we had to do it in one shot. \"it will be followed by a new tokyo ring road, set to be completed by march 2014, and two new larger loop lines that are under construction. while roads and bridges can help cut travel time for truckers, the government could do more to help by extending operating hours at container terminals, said toshio araki, head of container operations at the tokyo trucking association .\" the problem is with processing at the terminal rather than the roads, \"araki said .\" it's extremely crowded. the gates are only open during the day and so trucks have to line up and wait. it can take anything from a couple of hours to more than 16 hours. \"the bridge, which has a walkway for pedestrians, is already helping to spur tourism in the area. sightseeing boat operator zeal cruise division has almost sold all its seats this month for its 80-minute tours of the bridge .\" the tours have become popular for families with kids, \"hirano takumi, zeal's president, said in an interview .\" we're almost completely booked for the opening month and next month. we want overseas tourists to come and see japan's new mammoth bridge. \"--editors: terje langeland, teo chian wei to contact the reporters on this story: <mark>chris cooper</mark> in tokyo at ccooper1 @ bloomberg.net; kiyotaka matsuda in tokyo at

better days, but we're still a long way from a genuine boom. indeed, some folks remain skeptical generally and warn that the economy is more likely to contract than grow in the foreseeable future. a higher level of confidence that we'll sidestep macro trouble is in order. but how? job growth seems to be perking up, but it could use some help. maybe we'll catch a break with residential real estate in the months ahead too. yes, real estate. granted, that's a tall order, or so the last several years suggest. it's been a long time since housing was a positive contributor to economic momentum. meantime, predictions of recovery have come and gone for, well, years. but while it's easy to remain gloomy about residential real estate, there has been progress, albeit primarily as a sector that's no longer contracting. unfortunately, it's not necessarily growing either. but after three years of treading water in housing starts and newly issued building permits, for instance (see chart below), are we finally at the stage for something approximating an authentic expansion? even if--a big if--we're at a turning point, any expansion is likely to be mild at best. but if you're willing to entertain an optimist outlook, the numbers suggest that there could be some light trickling into this tunnel. housing starts and new building permits are inching higher. meantime, housing inventories have fallen to 2005 levels, notes bill mcbride at calculated risk. the drop inspires slate's matthew yglesias to think on the bright side and write: lower inventory \"obviously doesn't mean that we're primed for a return to full boom levels of residential investment and construction employment, but it does mean that we should be primed for a return to something like long-term average levels of residential investment and construction employment .\" perhaps it's no surprise to find that a housing industry economist is expecting better times, but <mark>david crowe</mark> of the national association of home builders argues that 2012 will be an improvement over last year. \"i'm looking at 2012 as sort of a ramping event to get a much more solid recovery in 2013,\" he tells ap. if so, maybe we'll see some supporting evidence in next week's scheduled updates for housing starts and building permits for january. estimated to be as high as 18%, and so even modest growth for this sector could be just the thing that's needed to keep the expansion going. says <mark>crowe</mark>, \"but it is not going to be great. we are so far down we almost have to see some improvement .\" residential property investment is poised to increase at more than twice the rate of gdp this year, predicts bank of america merrill lynch, reports housingwire. according to the analysts, even a modest revival \"will help reduce the stubbornly high bucket of long-term unemployment and underpin confidence. a virtuous cycle can start to develop, but it will be gradual .\" if so, we may see some clues in next week's housing reports. hope springs eternal for this sector? again. new deal to help sort out the foreclosure mess. perhaps it's no surprise that homebuilder shares have popped recently. \"anything

are messing with husband <mark>tom brady</mark>, you are also messing with her - and that won't be pleasant. throughout my life, i have been constantly lectured by friends and foes alike about my cluelessness regarding two subjects in particular. one, i don't understand football. two, i don't understand women. rarely have these two blind sports come into confluence as they did last week, when gisele bundchen launched her campaign to be hired as receivers coach for the new england patriots. heckled by new york giants fans after a crushing super bowl defeat, mrs. <mark>tom brady</mark> responded by pointing out that her husband cannot throw and catch the ball at the same time. i do not defend heckler, ever. still, bundchen's expletive-laced indictment of the receivers, whose dropped passes sabotaged the patriots' last-minute drive, made life harder and not easier for her <mark>tom</mark>. like all good quarterbacks, <mark>brady</mark> nurtures his relationship with the men who catch his bullet-like throws. here's a guy who said defended <mark>randy moss</mark> and said nice things about chad ochocinco, for cryin' out loud. it gets no easier when the wife starts cryin' out loud or assigning blame. or so i thought. \"i feel sorry for gisele,\" a woman in the bank told me. after i had picked myself off the floor and stopped laughing, i asked why. she's being criticized for defending her husband. what's wrong with that? \"point taken, i said. i left for the office, wondering if that opinion represented a minority of one. not hardly, as the kids say .\" i don't care what anyone says. i'm defending gisele, \"said a woman who knows her football better than i do, and almost as well as gisele thinks she does. i have conferred with a few other women how they felt about bundchen's outburst. it's not unanimous, but evidently, a percentage of american femininity is standing by gisele for standing by her man. they all refer to her by her first name, suggesting a bond that should not be challenged. a common response begins with,\" i don't care what anyone says. \"i interpreted\" anyone, \"to mean\" me, \"or anyone unfortunate enough to share my gender. this has caused me to reassess the entire bundchen controversy. having lived through the women's liberation movement and changing attitudes of american culture, i realized bundchen represents something to all of us. to the modern woman, she is far from your everyday trophy wife. she is a bright, involved and feisty marriage partner, and very much her own person. to the more old-fashioned crowd, she is tammy wynette, crooning\" stand by your man, \"while the gloria steinems of the world cringe. american men, i would guess, are fairly united in their belief that bundchen should have kept her mouth shut. that i what many american men think all women, especially wives, should do. american women are tired of that. they probably figure if <mark>terry bradshaw</mark> can bray into the microphone and be passed off as a football analyst, anybody can do it. i think bundchen was a little harsh with the receivers. wes welker in particular has received too much blame for failing to haul in a pretty difficult catch. even so, i am willing to re-examine my initial reaction that bundchen was out of bounds by trashing her husband's own receivers. this could usher in an entirely new form of nfl analysis. instead of sending it back to the studio at halftime, we could send it up to the luxury boxes. there, the wives could break down the game with a candor we don't get from the clowns in the booth. until that day comes, i have to admire <mark>tom brady</mark>. sure, his wife is gorgeous, but she is also incredibly loyal. she is certainly no mrs. fritz peterson or mrs. mike kekick of 1972. those were the wives of new york yankees pitcher who were swapped by their husbands, at a time society still thought that was strange. not gisele. had the patriots done protected <mark>brady</mark>
