wing pairings that trip off the tongue for older wolves fans. throw in norman deeley, alan hinton and kenny hibbitt, and from the late 1940s to the early '80s, wolves were blessed with some terrific talent down the flanks. johnny hancocks, <mark>jimmy mullen</mark> and deeley could dazzle and all three were heavy scorers in their trophy-laden careers during the club's halcyon days, while hinton's replacement <mark>dave wagstaffe</mark> was arguably the finest crosser in wolves' history. decades on, could an age-old wolves tradition about to be revived in earnest? in 2008-09, michael kightly and <mark>matt jarvis</mark> dazzled on opposite flanks, providing the ammuntion for chris iwelumo and sylvan ebank-blake to fire wolves to the championship title. and now the tradition could be about to take off again in the shape of <mark>jarvis</mark> and adam hammill. the pair were irresistible in sunday's 3-3 draw against tottenham, with <mark>jarvis</mark> back to his best in a classy performance culminating in the cross for <mark>steven fletcher</mark>'s late equaliser. during their glory years under stan cullis, wolves regularly outscored the opposition and their record of four successive seasons of scoring more than 100 league goals a season from 1957-61 still stands to this day. the class of 2011 have scored seven goals in two home games to give wolves the eighth best home record in the premier league, while only seven teams have scored more in front of their own fans. hammill sees the traditional wing-play being a key factor in their survival prospects. he said: \"you go back to old fashioned wingers and it was always their job to get to the byeline and get crosses in\" i think both \"jarvo' and myself are old-fashioned in the way we take players on and get to the byeline .\" it can be exciting to watch and hopefully we'll carry on doing it and creating plenty of chances between now and the end of the season. \"even after we equalised against spurs we were still attacking. it shows we weren't happy with just a point .\" manager <mark>mick mccarthy</mark> maintains the exciting wing play is no accident. he said: \"we work hard at it and i believe we've got two terrific wingers .\" the spurs game was a bit of a throwback to a more carefree era, as both teams went hell for leather trying to outscore the other. clearly the players enjoyed it as much as the fans, who were left on the edge of their seats. hammill said: \"it was one of the best games i've played in. it was end-to-end and one of those games fans want to see .\" it would have been easy after their second goal to go into our shells but we didn't. \"we had a few minutes where we stayed compact, got our two banks of four and then went on to create chances again .\" <mark>mccarthy</mark> believes punters should expect more thrills and spills watching his side this season. he said: \"it was an exciting game, it's never anything but here. i'm only 35 - it's the game that's doing this to me!\" we shouldn't have to score four goals to win a game but tottenham are a terrific team. \"i was happy with a point, especially after losing a goal straight after half-time which was down to our gross stupidity .\" recalled midfielder nenad milijas, who heavily involved in the game's key moments,, is convinced wolves will win their survival battle. he said: \"it was a crazy game but it was fantastic for the fans .\" i was happy with a point, but when we score three goals at home, we need to take three points. i thought we were really unlucky in the match. \"they scored three magnificent goals - probably the best goals of the weekend. but we gave everything we had just to take one point. we're playing well and if we carry on playing like we are, we'll stay up .\" we don't have someone like lionel messi where we can give one player the ball and they will win matches for us. \"we must play as a team to win games .\" latest blog -

will provide the music for the april 29 wedding of prince william and <mark>kate middleton</mark>. william's office at st. <mark>james</mark>'s palace said the ceremony will feature the choir of westminster abbey, the chapel royal choir, the london chamber orchestra and a fanfare team from the royal air force band. the palace said that william and his fiancee \"have taken a great deal of interest and care in choosing the music for their service,\" which will include well-known hymns and choral works as well as pieces commissioned especially for the occasion. the couple and william's father, prince charles, recently made an unannounced evening visit to westminster abbey to hear live musical performances as part of the preparation process. guests at a buckingham palace reception to be hosted by queen elizabeth ii after the wedding will be soothed by the strains of <mark>claire jones</mark>, prince charles' official harpist, the palace said. the choirs will be directed by <mark>james o'donnell</mark>, organist and master of the choir at westminster abbey. the westminster abbey choir consists of 20 boys and 12 professional adult singers, known as lay vicars. the choir sings the daily choral services in the abbey and often sings at major national events at the abbey. officials said robert quinney will play the organ. the chapel royal choir dates back at least to the era of the norman conquest, officials said. its primary roles are to sing the weekly service in the chapel royal at st. <mark>james</mark>' palace and to perform for the royal family on special occasions. the schedule calls for the london chamber orchestra to be conducted by christopher warren-green, its music director. it will consist of 39 musicians placed in the organ loft of the abbey. the orchestra was founded in 1921 by anthony bernard. no announcement has been made yet about the live entertainment at an evening reception at the palace to be hosted by prince charles for close friends of william and his bride .? copyright 2011 associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. tweet yahoo! buzz sharethis",

said. \"we decided to come to fresno state together ....i just told her that we had the best time; we made the right choice .\" ross and arnold, joined by taja edwards, hayley munro and emma andrews, were the nucleus of fresno state teams that made four consecutive ncaa appearances. the last one ended like the first three, with a loss, 82-68 to north carolina at the pit. the bulldogs also won three western athletic conference regular-season and tournament championships, more firsts for the program. \"i'm proud of our senior class,\" ross said. \"we made great leaps for the program .\" ross finished with a school-record 2,002 points. her 389 3-pointers was a record, falling three short of tying the ncaa division i mark, and she leaves with a steals record of 247. munro, with her team-high 15 points saturday, finished with 1,410--sixth on the school list. she also had 764 rebounds to move into third place in the program. big blow <mark>taylor thompson</mark>, welcome to the

day in the ncaa tournament, but said she never felt frustrated trying to shoot over north carolina's taller defenders. the tar heels tried not to let her out of their sight and she made just 5 of 21 shots, including 4 of 20 from 3-point range. in the second half, with fresno state trailing by four points, ross took 13 shots--all 3s--and made only one. \"i took a couple rushed shots i shouldn't have,\" she said. \"but i didn't focus on being frustrated. they weren't going in, but the more we worked it, the more my other teammates got shots .\" that's a lot of 3s fresno state's school-record 50 3-pointers attempted was 10 more than north carolina had allowed in sylvia hatchell's 25 years as coach. the 50 also were the most in a regulation ncaa tournament game. hatchell put 5-10 tierra
