Yet no one among the sellout crowd of 9,472 Thursday at JetBlue Park for the first Red Sox-Astros encounter of the spring seemed to mind. When the Red Sox clubhouse opened at 8 a.m., the lineup cards for both teams were posted just inside the door. Familiar names filled out the Red Sox' side--Xander Bogaerts (at shortstop for the first time this spring), J.D. Martinez, Rafael Devers. It was not far from the lineup they'll wield on Opening Day March 26 in Toronto. The Astros' side was a different matter. Manager Dusty Baker's batting order included relative obscurities with the last names Dawson (Ronnie, not Andre), Stubbs (Garrett, not Franklin or Drew), and Mayfield (Jack, definitely not Baker). Advertisement Alex Bregman did not make the two-plus-hour trip from the Astros' camp in Kissimmee. Neither did Jose Altuve, <mark>Carlos Correa</mark>, or <mark>George Springer</mark>. There was not a single Astro that baseball-reference. com considered a starter from last year's team. Aledmys Diaz, who had 247 plate appearances last year as <mark>Correa</mark>'s understudy, was the most experienced Astro in the lineup. The entire lineup combined for 640 plate appearances in the majors last season, or 50 fewer than Bregman alone. The most notable member of the champion 2017 Astros to put in an appearance at JetBlue Thursday was pitcher Collin McHugh, who stopped in to sign a one-year contract with the Red Sox. The absence of any Astro with legitimate name recognition was naturally a cause of suspicion given the events of the offseason. The Astros were busted in a sign-stealing scandal that cost general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch their jobs and has led many fans to put a mental asterisk on their 2017 World Series title. The collateral damage reached Boston, too, with former Astros bench coach Alex Cora losing his managerial job with the Red Sox for his role as a mastermind of the Astros' cheating. The Red Sox, accused of a sign-stealing scheme of their own during Cora's tenure, are still waiting to learn the consequences. Advertisement For now, the Astros are the sole wearers of the black hats, baseball's bad guys, the sport's most collectively disliked franchise in recent memory. They've been booed lustily in opposing territory this spring, and seven Houston batters were hit by pitches through the first week of spring training games. Perhaps it's wise for preservation purposes to keep theelite players away from road crowds for a while. But manager Dusty Baker, Hinch's replacement and a calming presence who each day must face questions about a scandal he had nothing to do with, said he left his stars home for case-by-case reasons. \"You've got Altuve who is sick,\" said Baker, holding court in the Astros' dugout two hours before the game. \"You've got [Yordan] Alvarez who is dealing with his knee. Bregman and Altuve went to Lakeland [to play the Tigers Wednesday]. I try to play them every other day. So no, it's not out of the ordinary at all .\" Baker did acknowledge that his roster was a little short of recognizable major league talent. Teams are supposed to bring a minimum of four regulars to each road game. \"The hardest part is having four regulars that can go, because we don't have a utility-type team,\" said Baker. \"We were told Diaz didn't count, and he has four years in the big leagues .\" Advertisement Baker was asked who actually does count. \"Bregman,\" he deadpanned. \"Altuve...\"So this starless sky of a lineup he brought with him had nothing to do with avoiding a potentially loud and aggravated reception from Boston fans?\" Hell, no, \"said Baker .\" That was the furthest thing from my mind. \"Perhaps it was because all of the familiar names and suspected trash-can bangers were not in attendance, but it turned out that there was no obvious negative response to the Astros anyway. There were no boo birds among the snowbirds. No hoots or verbal jabs were aimed at leadoff hitter Myles Straw when he dug in. A foul pole to foul pole walk through the concourse in the first inning revealed not a single anti-Astros sign in the crowd. Signs are not technically prohibited in JetBlue's ballpark rules (don't try to bring in beach balls, flag poles, lawn chairs, firearms, or knives of any size, however). Three ticket takers working Gate B told me that they hadn't seen a single sign all day. Of course, maybe Red Sox fans should be hesitant to let the Astros have it quite yet since any punishment for their own team's alleged sign-stealing scheme is pending, and has been pending for a somewhat alarming amount of time. To totally hate on the Astros before knowing your own team's consequences would be akin to playing baseball in a glass house, something Baker subtly noted before the game.

Tentatively, it looks like Eala and her fellow water protectors may have won. Today the US Army Corps of Engineers announced in a press release that it is denying a permit builders of the Dakota Access pipeline need in order go forward with their plans to drill under the Missouri River. In response to the decision, Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II has issued this statement: \"This is something that will go down in history and I know that it's a blessing,\" Archambault said. Activists who have been camping out in the cold for months are ecstatic. Benalex Dupris, a film producer I met at camp and a member of the Colville Confederated Tribes from Washington State, described the scene to me like this: The scene at camp is electric, with eagle feathers on top hats, army jackets that don't camouflage from the snow, and wild ass Indians war hooping at each other non stop. Everyone is singing or crying, and in the distance it's either cries of \"Mni Wiconi\" or \"black snake killa .\" Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and president of the National Congress of American Indians, put out a statement thanking the Obama administration for the Army Corps' decision. US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell also released a statement saying that there would be \"an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts .\" The Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, announced that alternative routes would be considered through an Environmental Impact Statement, a process that takes months and will incorporate public and tribal input. \"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do,\" Darcy said. Even though the Army Corps of Engineers has denied the Dakota Access pipeline project the permit to drill under Lake Oahe, a man-made reservoir on the Missouri River, much of the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline has already been completed. Dupris, the filmmaker I quoted above, says people are celebrating a \"cautious victory .\" <mark>Donald Trump</mark> has expressed his support for the pipeline project, and it remains to be seen whether a <mark>Trump</mark> administration might just re-issue a permit for a pipeline that impacts tribal rights and access to clean drinking water. \"We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming <mark>Trump</mark> administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point,\" Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement. Update: Here's the full statement from Archambault: Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will not be granting the easement to cross Lake Oahe for the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision. We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. Throughout this effort I have stressed the importance of acting at all times in a peaceful and prayerful manner--and that is how we will respond to this decision. With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones, many of whom have sacrificed as well. We look forward to celebrating in wopila, in thanks, in the coming days. We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming <mark>Trump</mark> administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point. When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. To our local law enforcement, I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people. I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect. Again, we are deeply appreciative that the Obama Administration took the time and effort to genuinely consider the broad spectrum of tribal concerns. In a system that has continuously been stacked against us from every angle, it took tremendous courage to take a new approach to our nation-to-nation relationship, and we will be forever grateful."}, {"articleID": "2012032602_00064032_W", "names": {"Michael Mann": ["Q1425193", "Q1827335", "Q1928511", "Q270097", "Q30276452", "Q633081", "Q6832490"], "Walter White": ["Q59196219", "Q7966404"]}, "date": "2012-03-26", "url": "http://hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-luck-creator-david-milch-on-the-series-premature-end", "content": "interview: \"luck' creator david milch on the series' premature end\" luck \"suggesting creator david milch had a premonition that the series would be abruptly canceled due to the third horse death during production, milch told me in an interview on friday that he never had it in his mind that this would be a series finale.

angry incredulity. who was it who ultimately made that call? was it you and <mark>michael</mark>? was it hbo? it was hbo, definitively. there was back and forth about it, but their feeling was so clearly that the situation was untenable, that there was really no protracted dispute. we were presented with an accomplished fact. and i don't say that with any resentment. they made the decision they felt they had to make. but had it been up to you, would that have been the decision? no, i guess i would have continued. in no way was there any irresponsibility or failure of care in the treatment of those horses. i satisfied myself with that repeatedly. i don't know if you're familiar with the details of how this horse died - i read the interview you and <mark>michael</mark> did with matt seitz, so i know a little. this was an incident equivalent to you walking down the street, being frightened by something, taking a misstep and falling. the horse was not being asked to do anything remotely dangerous or that would put him in jeopardy. in any case, this was something that generated its own momentum and fed off itself. corporately, i absolutely understand what hbo felt were the necessities of its position. but substantively, there was no dereliction at all on our part. one of the questions i've heard asked in the wake of the cancellation was whether you could have continued the show without filming new racing scenes, whether using cgi horses or some kind of stock footage. that was a possibility that was examined. the horses are of the essence of the piece. we really weren't doing anything - you need the horses around. it's like asking an actor to act in company with a cartoon. long-term, it would've been an erosion of the credibility of the material. given your passion for this world and how long it took you to get this on the air, how does it feel to have it go away this quickly? it's a sick feeling. you realize, what swearengen used to say,\" if you want to hear god laugh, tell him your plans. \"we're creatures of forces so other than and more powerful than we are, that it's an illustion to believe anything else, and it's an occasion for gratitude wen you're able to sustain your endeavor and fate and experience accommodates it. i say that with no bitterness at all towards hbo. as i say, i think they were in an untenable position. how do you mean? just the bad publicity? yeah. anytime something happened, as it would inevitably have happened, they were going to get lambasted again. corporately, they just can't withstand that. i watched the finale again yesterday, and there are a number of moments and lines that feel prophetic - like marcus saying,\" today's the day they take it all away from us, \"or ace's speech at the end - like they were designed to be in a series finale. and that's always how i've viewed the last\" deadwood \"episode; like it was a series finale without being intended as one. were you ever thinking as you wrote this that there would be a chance you wouldn't get to do more? no, there was no sense of that on my part. by way of contrast, i absolutely knew when i was writing the last\" deadwood \"that it would be the last, and i wrote it intending it as the finale. interesting. i had never heard that before. that's the case. i was trying - the last images of swearengen scrubbing the bloodstain and saying\" wants me to tell him something pretty, \"that was as close as i felt i could come to a concluding speech. so you knew even at that point in production that hbo was not going to go forward? yes, i did know that. how did the episode hold up for you? yeah. (pause) we would have found our stride. i don't think that we had conclusively, but the materials were moving in that direction. it was too bad. it was too bad. what do you think were some of the things that needed to be improved? or what were the parts of the show where you felt you were close to that direction? the extent to which the character of bernstein was living in self-deception was in the process of being revealed. as he encountered that fact and lived into the necessities of his situation, i think he was going to become a more transitive character. and that was very much in the process of being realized. but i try not to think about it too much. i interviewed milch and <mark>mann</mark> at press tour in january, i asked milch whether ace and <mark>walter</mark> never sharing any scenes together in the first season was by design, or if - like much of his work - things just turned out that way. he responded,\" it wasn't planned, but these are characters who have not discovered themselves as yet such as to make their intersection fruitful. they come together right at the beginning of the second season and it is every bit as provisional and tentative a coming together as you would expect, but these are both you know. you know dickens used the expression \"mind - forged manacles .\" these are isolates of one kind and another and they have a civil exchange with each other, but to expect more from them would be unrealistic. they have to find more of themselves first. \"which leads us to this ...) at the end of the interview in january, you and i spoke about how ace and <mark>walter</mark> would come together at the start of the second season. looking back, ace's story is largely separate from everyone else's. was that something that you realized as you were going on that maybe he was too far apart from the rest of the world? yes. i agree with that. it assumed a little bit too much of the viewer, i think. since we're not going to see it play out, what exactly was ace's plan in regards to mike? the best explanation i've seen was from one of my commenters, who suggests that ace wants mike to steal the casino deal out from under him, and that mike will go to prison as a result because it's crooked. is that it? yeah, that's pretty close. when you compress it, invariably you distort it. you obviously have to do what you think is appropriate, but my own preference is not to linger too much on the would have beens of this show. okay, then let's look back on what was instead. in these nine episodes that you were able to make, what do you feel were the strengths of it? what are some scenes you would point to as the show you had in your head all these years? that's a good question. everything that demonstrates the human capacity for perseverance and self-deception simultaneously. those are the scenes that i like. i recall with affection so many of the scenes with the degenerates and that connection. and i enjoyed very much writing the scenes between gus and bernstein. in some ways, i felt that those two sets of relationships mirrored each other. watching the show, it really did feel like your heart was particularly in the scenes with the four degenerates. that's right. if i were to point to a favorite scene, i guess it would be the niagara falls scene, where they were doing the exegesis of niagara fall as opposed to niagara falls, and what the might possibly mean. now that this is done, are you moving full-force onto the william faulkner project? yes. we were just working on the concluding section of\" light in august \"when you called. i had the privilege of working on that with my daughter, olivia. so it's a compounded pleasure. i'm hopeful that hbo will be receptive. i have no reason to think they won't be. this is the third time now you've done a show for them and the third time it's ended before you were intending it to end. are you still okay with the relationship? absolutely. each set of circumstances was unique. you'll have to ask them whether they are (option 1 comment instantly as a guest it's not a cliffhanger. there were places the story could have gone in a fourth season, but no one's fate was hanging in the balance, and most of the stories of the third season came to a close. even though i never watched it myself - horse racing is not my thing - it's a real shame such a talented writer lost his series under such circumstances, because of distortions from a typically hypocritical peta, who put to death about 85% of the animals arriving at their shelters, btw - whereas luck (darkly ironic name, given the series had none) was just the victim of a sad accident. hope milch's next project goes wonderfully for him .\" good wife': matthew perry on his \"strictly sexual' relationship with alicia florrick novak djokovic on '60 minutes':' [the war] made us tougher...more hungry for the success' weekend box office: the hunger games opens with $155 million--why it's good news for the industry and the moviegoer about this blog all through his childhood, alan sepinwall's relatives told his parents,\" all that boy does is watch television! how's he going to make a living doing that?

The first two books, published under the \"Shero Comics\" indie imprint, have quickly gained popularity amongst seasoned comic book fans.

Sun 24 Dec 2017 10:18 EST Expand | Collapse REUTERS/Kevin Coombs Hustle. Bustle. It's all too easy to look up at the end of December and--poof--like excess glitter in the floor that fell from some cheap ornament, the moment gets vacuumed up or packed away for next year like another decoration. So this Christmas, how can we truly be present and not just buy presents? The answer is surprisingly found in the most fundamental of places--in singing traditional carols together. Redemption drew a baby breath that first chilly Christmas night, offering eternal breath to a forlorn world dying to be rescued. And yet even before Jesus lay snuggled up in the manger, the miraculous story of rescue was already being sung about. Mary sang about Him in the Magnificat (Luke 1:46 -51). Zechariah sang about Him in the Benedictus (Luke 1:68 -79). And of course, on the night of His birth, the skies over Shepherds' Field became a vertical stage for hosts of choiring angels. We have literally been created, compelled and commanded to sing, thus it's no surprise that the oldest Christmas traditions are the masterpieces of the hymns: the carols. Our sixth annual Christmas event--Sing! An Irish Christmas Tour--features ten timeless hymns none of us should ever forget. 1. \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" is one of over 6,000 hymns penned by Charles Wesley, who included it in his 1739 Methodist hymnal. It was later set to music by Felix Mendelssohn, which added dashing majesty to the deeply theological truth of the words. This is among our richest hymns in terms of doctrine, but it got off to a bumpy start. Wesley's first line originally said, \"Hark, How All the Welkin Rings .\" The word \"welkin\" meant \"the vault of heaven .\" Evangelist George Whitefield did us all a favor by changing the words to \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing .\" We have finished the first half of every Irish Christmas concert with a celebratory arrangement of this song, including an Irish reel and cultural Irish dance, which I suspect would have pleased neither Wesley nor Mendelssohn! 2. \"Come Thou Long Expected Jesus\" is another carol by Charles Wesley, appearing in his book of 18 Christmas songs in 1745. If I had to name my three favorite carols, this would definitely be one of them. In its advent or its Old Testament context, imagine the centuries of waiting, longing and weeping coming to their fruition when people--and indeed all of us today in the chaos and emotion that is Christmas--can find our ultimate supernatural rest in Christ. Israel's strength and consolation, Hope of all the earth thou art; Dear desire of every nation, Joy of every longing heart. I can hardly get through this one without crying. 3. \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" is a Christmas call to worship, mostly likely written by <mark>John Francis</mark> Wade, a catholic artist who created beautiful manuscripts decorated with exquisite floral images. His hymn, Adeste Fidelis, remained a Latin masterpiece for a hundred years before being translated into English by Rev. Frederick Oakeley. For congregational singing, especially when trying to teach harmony or when singing acapella, this carol sings beautifully, which is why it is has often also been a selection to finish our Christmas concerts. 4. is among our most plaintive carols, partly because of the haunting melody by Gustav Holst. The words came from the pen of the English poet, Christina Rossetti, who was born in London in December, 1830. A gifted writer, she dictated her first story to her mother before she was old enough to read and write. She was also lauded as the most beloved poet of her generation. Her hymn, \"A Christmas Carol,\" appeared in the January issue of Scribner's Monthly in 1872, and was later set to music under the title, \"In the Bleak Midwinter .\" The last stanza has appeared on thousands of Christmas cards: \"What can I give Him, poor as I am? / If I were a Shepherd I would bring Him a lamb; / If I were a Wise Man I would do my part, / Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart .\" We have edited this carol and added Dvorak's New World Symphony melody to link it to Simeon's song, the benedictus, which has proved an effective moment of dedication in our Christmas events. \"In the Bleak Midwinter\" 5. with its triumph cadence and rousing spirit was written by the man who is frequently called the \"Father of the English Hymn,\" Isaac Watts. It was published a 1719 hymnal in which Watts translated, interpreted, and paraphrased the Old Testament book of Psalms, overlaying them with the truths of the Gospel. He called the hymnal, The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament. \"I have rather expressed myself as I may suppose David would have done if he lived in the days of Christianity,\" said Watts. His hymn, \"Joy to the World,\" wasn't originally a Christmas hymn, but history has embedded it into our holiday traditions. \"Joy to the World\" 6. \"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\" is a medieval Latin hymn dating from the 800s. It was one of a series of antiphons that were sung every December, and it isn't hard to imagine the mystic beauty of this hymn echoing off the walls of remote monasteries during the Middle Ages. This particular antiphon was discovered by an English minister and musician named <mark>John Mason</mark> Neale, who rendered it into English and published it in 1851. 7. \"Joy Has Dawned\" is a hymn Stuart Townend and I wrote back in 2004 as part of the Apostles Creed collection we put together following the introduction of In Christ Alone. It takes us through the Christmas story, explaining much of the symbolism, and has been a helpful hymn for both children and adults. Stuart wanted to draw out parts of the Christmas story, such as the gifts of the Magi, that aren't particularly present in other Christmas hymns and demonstrate how those elements are connected to the gospel story and present throughout. Melodically, we wanted to give this carol the same fit and feel you might expect from classic Christmas songs you sang growing up in church so there would be an element of familiarity the first time you sang it. If you are considering using this with your congregation, we often find it helpful to combine this with a familiar hymn such as angels \"We Have Heard On High .\" 8. \"Angels we have heard on High\" is one of the most joyful and well-written choruses ever composed. The lyrical journey, which sweeps from \"Angels we have heard on high sweetly singing o'er the plain\" to the ending lyric, \"Gloria, in excelsis Deo,\" shines a light on the reality of incarnation in a way that refreshes the soul each time you sing it. 9. \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" was inspired by a visit to Bethlehem by the American preacher, Phillips Brooks. For the 1867 Christmas worship services at Philadelphia's Holy Trinity Church, Brooks wanted to write a carol for his children's choir. Recalling his visit to the birthplace of Jesus, Brooks wrote the words for \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" and handed them to the church's worship leader, Lewis Redner, who composed the melody. It was first sung by a group of six Sunday School teachers and thirty-six children. 10. \"Once is Royal David's City\" might be the least known of these 10 carols, but we mustn't lose its message or music. Cecil Frances Alexander was a pastor's wife whose poetry was much better known than her husband's sermons. She published this carol in her hymnbook for children in 1848. She's also the author of the children's hymn, \"All Things Bright and Beautiful .\" How interesting it is, then, that many consider her works too deep to sing in adult congregations today. The famous festival of lessons and carols service at King's College in Cambridge opens every year with this carol, where a boy soprano (nominated that day!) opens the service that is televised around the world with verse one as a solo. If ever we needed empirical evidence that the Irish actually did save civilization, this may actually be it. How remarkable that every December the greatest themes of the Gospel are carried by the winds, through the malls, into hotels and restaurants and stores and churches as we hear, play, and most importantly, sing the carols of Christmas! They express our highest Christian worship, sharing joy with the world in the bleak midwinter. They remind us that hope has dawned in the little town of Bethlehem, in Royal David's city, and we should all join the triumph of the skies. O come, let us adore Him--Christ the Lord!
