Back when <mark>George Lucas</mark> was first creating the now iconic franchise, no one knew what it would become. But, the movie took the world by storm and introduced everyone to the galaxy far, far away. In doing so, Star Wars launched the acting careers of Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford. A New Hope Amid this cast of newcomers though was Alec Guinness as the wise old Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He helped bring some early legitimacy to the project thanks to his extensive and acclaimed filmography. By this point in Guinness' career, he had already won an Academy Award for his performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, was nominated for his work in The Lavender Hill Mob, and even received a nomination as a writer on The Horse's Mouth. He also was featured in a major role in Lawrence of Arabia. In many ways, his presence in the film helped bring a sense of believability to this new mythology <mark>Lucas</mark> created - but Guinness was not a fan. Related: Star Wars: Every Change <mark>George Lucas</mark> Made To Han Killing Greedo Guinness made for a great Obi-Wan in the original trilogy but did not enjoy his experience with A New Hope. He only took the role after his higher salary demands were met. But, his doubled pay did not keep him happy throughout the production process. As discussed in the latest Screen Rant video, Guinness hated working on the film and his chief complaint was <mark>Lucas</mark>' dialogue. He said in a since published letter that the writing was \"rubbish\" and was not pleased that \"none of it makes my character clear or even bearable .\" He is hardly the only actor to not like the movie he worked on though, so check out the video for more such examples. Although Guinness' top complaint about A New Hope was the constantly rewritten dialogue, there were other issues he had with the production. He lamented the conditions of filming in another letter, saying that the shoot was \"tedious to a degree - hot, boring and indecisive .\" Guinness also struggled to connect with his much younger co-stars. Despite all of his dissatisfaction for A New Hope, Guinness did not let any of it stop him from putting his best foot forward. He was rewarded in 1978 with another Academy Award nomination, this time for playing Obi-Wan - rubbish dialogue and all. While Guinness may have helped make <mark>Lucas</mark>' dialogue work, his complaint about the quality of it has been shared by other actors in the franchise. It's also no secret that dialogue is not <mark>Lucas</mark>' strong suit. He's proven to be an exceptional storyteller with a vision for the big picture and pushing the limits of technology, but he's just not as great with the dialogue. While <mark>Lucas</mark> wrote all on his own, Lawrence Kasdan was brought aboard to help fine-tune the sequels with <mark>Lucas</mark> passing directing duties to others. So, hopefully Guinness was happier with the dialogue he received in his future appearances.

That figure includes 229 rapes across the company's 1.3 billion rides. The ride-hailing company noted that drivers and riders were both attacked, and that some assaults occurred between riders. The Thursday report, which the company hailed as the first of its kind, provides a rare look into the traffic deaths, murders and reported sexual assaults that took place during billions of annual rides arranged in the U.S. using Uber's service. It is part of the company's effort to be more transparent after years of criticism over its safety record. In 2017, the company counted 2,936 reported sexual assaults during 1 billion U.S. trips. Uber bases its numbers on reports from riders and drivers, meaning the actual numbers could be much higher. Sexual assaults commonly go unreported. \"I suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they're still too common,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted about the report. \"Some people will appreciate how much we've done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right .\" Uber's share price dropped more than 1% in after-hours trading. Uber and competitor Lyft have faced harsh criticism for not doing enough to protect the safety of their riders and drivers. Dozens of women are suing Lyft, claiming the company should have done more to protect them from driver assaults. A Connecticut woman sued Uber last month, claiming she was sexually assaulted by her driver. London refused to renew Uber's license to operate in the city in November after the company was plagued with safety issues including concerns about impostor drivers. Uber said it will appeal the decision. The companies have both formed partnerships with sexual assault prevention networks and other safety groups, and have touted their background check policies for drivers. But many say they haven't gone far enough to protect passengers and drivers, who are contract workers for the companies. \"Keeping this information in the dark doesn't make anyone safer,\" Uber said in a statement announcing the report. It plans to release its safety report every two years going forward. Lyft said last year it would also release a safety report. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that it \"remained committed\" to releasing a report, but did not say when. Mike Bomberger, a lawyer representing more than 100 victims of sexual assault in lawsuits against Uber and Lyft, applauded Uber for releasing the numbers. \"One of the problems with both of these companies is that they have hidden and have tried to conceal the number of sexual assaults that occur in their vehicles,\" he said. In response, an Uber spokesperson pointed to the just-released report. Lyft called Bomberger's charge \"baseless .\" Bomberger said he believes 80% to 90% of the assaults in the Uber report could have been prevented by measures such as cameras in the cars recording rides and the companies reporting every assault they learn of to the police. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said it appreciated Uber's transparency. \"This is an issue that affects every institution in America,\" RAINN press secretary <mark>Emily Robinson</mark> said in a statement. She added that organizations in every industry, including education, should \"make a similar effort to track and analyze sexual misconduct within their communities .\" The report stated that Uber rides were involved in 97 reported crashes in 2017 and 2018, resulting in 107 deaths. The company said the figure represents about half of the national rate for fatal crashes. Sexual assault in the report is defined broadly into categories including non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part, attempted non-consensual sexual penetration, non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, non-consensual kissing of a sexual body part and non-consensual sexual penetration. The company also said Uber rides were involved in nine murders during 2018, and 10 during 2017. Uber noted that the vast majority--99.9%--of its rides had no reported safety issues.

Kind of. Sort of. We didn't really see any parts that were especiallty private when Williams, as the character of Arya Stark, stripped down to engage in her first-ever sexual experience with a truly stunned Gendry. The character figured she only had hours left to live, due to the impending arrival of the Night King's army, and wanted to know what intercourse felt like before she was crossed off someone else's list. A pretty understandable reaction to near-certain death, right? And the way Arya went about seducing Gendry (basically ordering him to take his clothes off and just do her already) was true to the strong woman she has become...... and yet a debate has been raging on the Internet over this sex scene. Was it empowering? Or was it uncomfortable and sort of gross? Those who take the side of \"Yech, disgusting!\" are reacting that way because Williams started on Game of Thrones when she was 14. We met Arya when the character was 11. So Arya is 18 years old now (of consenting age, we presume, in Westeros) and Williams is 22. Neither age is really too young for sex, yet many social media users have been complaining all week that the scene was \"weird\" or \"uncalled for .\" (These same people have been oddly silent about all the incest on the series. But let's not digress too far here .) Clearly aware of the backlash online, the actress took to Twitter on Tuesday and put an end to it as follows. This is what she wrote: \"if u feel uncomfortable just know that my mother and my step dad and my 2 sisters and my 4 brothers have all probably watched this too ahahakillmeehehe .\" HA! We love it. Previously, Williams admitted in an interview that she thought the Arya sex scene was written as a \"prank\" when she first read it in the script. But it was obviously very real. Said the star to Entertainment Weekly after the episode aired: \"This is something she's stayed away from, an emotion we've never really seen her engage with. [The series creators] were like,\" It's the end of the world, what else would you have her do?' \"This may be is a moment where Arya accepts death tomorrow, which she never does...\"So, it was that moment where she says,\" We're probably going to die tomorrow, I want to know what this feels like before that happens .' \"It's interesting to see Arya be a bit more human, speak more normally about things people are scared of .\" As you can see below, meanwhile, Williams' best friend on the show, <mark>Sophie Turner</mark>, definitely saw no problem at all with the scene: <mark>Sophie Turner</mark> on Maisie Williams Sex Scene We repeat: HA! \"In honor of Easter, I guess Game of Thrones wanted the storyline to have a little Easter bunny hop-hop-hopping into that pussy. And that's the tea,\" <mark>Turner</mark> says in the above video, punctuating the line with a sip of wine. Truly amazing.

He said the mobile phone conversation could always be recorded and later misused. Mulayam Singh Yadav. PTI He went on to say that he was specifically telling this to girls and women, to beware of this gadget as \"a lot of indecent things\" happen due to this instrument. The book on orphaned children has been written by the daughter of Pradeep Shukla, who was accused and then jailed in the NRHM scam and is currently out on bail serving as a Principal Secretary to the government. Mulayam's statement gains significance in the backdrop of the allegation by an IPS officer Amitabh Thakur, currently under suspension, that the SP president had threatened him on phone in July. Mulayam alluded to this connection by saying that he himself had landed in a trouble due to the use of the mobile phone. \"Once I said something on the mobile phone and the conversation was recorded...It is good that the India is developing and technology like computer also growing. But mobile phone--it's a dangerous instrument,\" he said. He also added that he did not use mobile phone unless it was unavoidable. \"If somebody calls me on the mobile then I snub that person and ask him what prevents him from calling on the land line? One may call me on the mobile phone if I am away from home in a field in the village .\" The SP and its leaders have in the past too been particularly piqued at these gadgets. On 23 October senior minister Mohammad Azam <mark>Khan</mark> had blamed smart phones for the rise in crime against women. Referring to recent incidents in Delhi where two toddlers were raped and assaulted, <mark>Azam Khan</mark> had said pornographic material is easily accessible over smartphone to people even in villages which are ruining the growth of children and youth. Last year Mulayam had even laid the blame on computers and laptops for his party's defeat in the Lok Sabha election. He had said that he had cautioned his son Akhilesh not to distribute laptops to students, but these were distributed, \"and Modi had cleverly put his photos and speeches on the laptop,\" he had said. Although later he had also said at a function in the Press Club in Lucknow that the social media had its own uses and should be properly utilized. Later, reacting to Mulayam's statement, Amitabh Thakur said that the mobile phone was a \"wonderful\" instrument that had brought the people of the world closer to each other. \"Only those people need to be scared of it who use it for wrong or unlawful purposes. If we use it for the right purpose then why should we be scared?\" he asked. Amitabh Thakur and his wife Nutan have been alleging that the SP government has been hounding them ever since Nutan filed a complaint related to illegal mining against the mining minister Gayatri Prajapati. Amitabh has also filed a complaint that Mulayam had threatened Amitabh on telephone during a conversation on July 10. The police had initially failed to register even a complaint but later lodged it after Thakur moved court. Although the Hazratganj police in Lucknow has filed the final report in this case, the court has asked Thakur to present his arguments on November 19. The Uttar Pradesh government has introduced several mobile apps including those for police assistance and tourism information, and these are quite widely used as well.

(chris riley/times-herald) two years after losing her job as a clerk at travis air force base, <mark>karen taylor</mark> of vallejo is taking her case to the president of the united states. or at least to his front yard. taylor said her health has suffered, and that her retirement, medical benefits and job seniority are at stake. she wants her day in court, and said if that means going to washington next week and standing with protest signs all day for four days in front of the white house then that's what she'll do. \"i'm six feet tall,\" taylor said. \"do you think if i stand out there with these signs held up, i won't be noticed?\" since her story ran in the times-herald in february 2007, taylor, now 45, said she has lost one wrongful termination court case, which is under appeal. there are several other cases related to her racial discrimination and harassment claims pending in federal court, she said. \"i'm going to washington and i'm going to stage a one-woman protest,\" she said. \"i already contacted attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> to let him know i'm coming .\" no one from the obama administration has responded, she said. \"my job made me happy,\" she said of the employment she began on mare island at 16, before being transferred to travis when the shipyard closed. \"it allowed me to pursue my other interests--feeding the homeless in vallejo on thanksgiving, playing santa for the neighborhood kids at christmas .\" taylor said she has dozens of boxes filled with documentation on her case and wants to present her evidence to a jury. she said she is also fighting for other travis workers of color who may have given up. \"and this is not just for <mark>karen taylor</mark>,\" she said. \"this is for all the african americans on base, so they know they can stand up for what's right .\" no one from travis was immediately available to speak to the issue tuesday afternoon, but in 2007, a spokeswoman said that base officials take complaints of discrimination seriously. \"in 20 years, there have been two (equal employment opportunity) findings against the air force at travis, all revolving around the same case, around 2004,\" capt. vanessa hillman said at the time. \"our commander takes all eeo complaints seriously and, if received, thoroughly investigates .\" no further comment would be forthcoming for privacy reasons, she said. taylor says her problems began when she complained about her new supervisor's employment practices. she went on medical stress leave, and then, despite her doctor's letter assuring her supervisors she'd be well enough to return to work within a month or two, taylor was fired. the stated reason was her \"inability to maintain a regular work schedule,\" according to a termination letter she received. the letter says her firing was \"non-disciplinary in nature\" and that there \"has been no misconduct or delinquency\" on her part. the supervisor has since been promoted and transferred, something hillman said at the time was unrelated to any complaints from minority or female employees. taylor says she won some union grievances and that the previous newspaper article created some noise, but things have stalled. \"my life's on hold, and i don't want to wait until i'm 80 to get recognized,\" she said. \"i don't want them to wait until i'm dead to say,\" yes, we did miss taylor wrong .' \"taylor's former union vice president joel perry said that while it's been a long time, he recalls that she had suffered reprisals and that a settlement was reached for some back pay. he attributed her problems to a\" personality conflict \"and not race or gender, however, and his opinion hasn't changed. the union no longer represents taylor, he said .\" we haven't represented her in years, \"perry said .\" she left her employment and she didn't think we were doing enough for her, so she left us. \"vallejo trustees to get panel's list of schools suggested for ..."}]
