they came in the night, screaming as they attacked policemen and soldiers in a series of assaults that escalated into a bloodbath that left more than 700 people dead. victims described the july 26 onslaught to the associated press tuesday, detailing highly coordinated and ruthless attacks by the radical islamist sect, boko haram. from hospital beds with family members kneeling at their feet, survivors said attackers used guns, knives and machetes - the latter to avoid accidentally shooting each other - as they swept through military barracks, police stations, homes of law enforcement officials and at least 22 churches. they said nigerian security forces had been unprepared for the militant offensive that spread last week to four states in northern nigeria, even though moderate muslim clerics had sounded warnings about the group. \"we were instructed that funny things were about to happen and that someone was going to attack the police station,\" said <mark>hassan ibrahim</mark>, a 29-year-old policeman in maiduguri, the capital of borno, who was recovering from stab wounds. still, he was unprepared as he stood guard at his police station two days after the warning, and despite knowing that sect members had recently robbed policemen in a different area of weapons. abubakr mohammed, a 33-year-old policeman who was shot in the torso, was at a different police station in maiduguri when it was attacked about midnight by militants shouting \"allahu akbar,\" or \"god is great .\" \"we heard our colleagues had been attacked in bauchi (state), but we never expected them to come to our own place and attack us,\" he said from his hospital bed. the survivors' accounts raise questions about the ability of the government of africa's most populous nation to respond to threats, and about the nature of the training received by the sect. nigerian forces finally stormed boko haram's headquarters in maiduguri on july 29 after bombarding it with mortars and grenades, killing about 100 militants. the compound - which stretched some 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) - was reduced to a heap of smoking rubble. it was guarded this week by heavily armed soldiers and surrounded by barbed wire. human rights groups allege many civilians were also slain as the police and army hunted down militants. the police shot the sect's charismatic leader, mohammed yusuf, on july 30 after he was captured although they say it was in a shootout. extremist groups have emerged in recent years in africa, posing dangers beyond the continent. the threat was underscored tuesday when australian police thwarted an alleged terrorist plot in which extremists with ties to an al-qaida-linked somali group planned to attack an australian military base with automatic weapons. in nigeria, one of africa's top oil producers, theft of oil revenues by corrupt politicians has angered many nigerians living in abject poverty and has strengthened the appeal of groups like boko haram, whose name means \"western education is sacrilege .\" u.s. secretary of state hillary rodham clinton, who began an africa tour on tuesday, plans to address these issues with nigeria's leaders when she visits the country next week. boko haram sought to impose strict islamic law and abolish western education in the secular nation of 140 million, which is roughly divided between muslims in the north and christians in the south. the militants were well organized. in maiduguri, they attacked the homes of at least two senior police officers - one in charge of the training school, the other the second in command of the paramilitary mobile police unit - at the same time they hit the police stations and army barracks. another detachment attacked maiduguri's churches. the rev. ishaka dauda, pastor of one of the churches, said around 100 attackers scaled a 10-foot (3-meter) wall and hid in the church's primary school until the entire group was inside. they then burst out together, torching cars and buildings and throwing homemade bombs powerful enough to crack the church's concrete floor. \"you could hardly tell them from a nigerian soldier except their trousers were shorter,\" dauda said. trousers that stopped mid calf were part of the sect's uniform. the boko haram members methodically destroyed all six churches in maiduguri's wulari district. at elijah apostolic christ church, the attackers arrived with axes to chop through iron bars and wooden doors, said pastor olushola joseph. once inside, he said, they set the place ablaze. thomas peter, a religion scholar who was hacked with a machete as he tried to protect his father's church of christ, said he heard the fighters caution each other not to use their guns to prevent them from accidentally shooting each other. they burned down the church and came back two days later and burned down the house of his father. the violence also took a toll on family members of those who joined the sect. six-year-old umar mohamed wept monday as his brother recounted watching sect members prepare for battle with bombs, swords and knives. senate panel endorses obama nominees for ambassadors to china, japan among the biggest of oil speculators, us oil funds says it's not the boogie man former president bill clinton \"and party' depart pyongyang by plane: state media colombian president uribe on whirlwind trip through region to defend us bases pact federal grants give 1 more cop to some small towns, and police say it'll make a big difference ap interview: top us commander in iraq says american role is crucial as he disputes memo climate experts:\" cash for clunkers' won't do much to reduce greenhouse gas pollution arrest of us backpackers casts shadow over tourism boom in northern iraq's kurdish region federal grants give 1 more cop to some small towns, and police say it'll make a big difference va. appeals court overturns murder conviction of ex-navy seal trainee in ga. woman's death 3 men charged with murder, aiding al-qaida in american teacher's death in mauritania ohio bar owner charged with armed robbery after taking 11-year-old girl's skateboard ap interview: top us general in iraq disputes memo urging early pullout, says us still needed china says 83 formally arrested over rioting in xinjiang, to face charges including murder rights group accuses indian police of abuse, calls for national reforms druse leader seeks to calm storm after bolting from lebanon's western-backed alliance august 3rd, 2009 maiduguri, nigeria -

on doak walker award watch list ossaa rules jenks athlete ineligible; football program could forfeit games if the waiting is the hardest part, <mark>kevin williams</mark> and <mark>pat williams</mark> haven't shown it. the minnesota vikings and their stalwart defensive tackles are still seeking resolution to their fight against the nfl's attempt to issue them a four-game suspension for use of the now-infamous weight-loss supplement starcaps. more than eight months after news of their positive tests first broke, the williamses find themselves in continued limbo. \"i just keep on praying on it. that's all i'm going to do. whatever happens happens,\" <mark>pat williams</mark> said after tuesday's training camp practice, teasing <mark>adrian peterson</mark> on his way off the field about all the kids screaming for the running back's autograph. \"hopefully it will be over soon, and we can move on,\" said former oklahoma state <mark>kevin williams</mark>. \"i'm not going to even worry about it .\" the state judge involved in the case has said he'll decide this week whether to put the players' lawsuit on hold at the league's request, while a federal appeals court considers other issues including input from other major sports. the nfl wants the suspensions, originally handed out last season, to start with minnesota's opener on sept. 13, but the league would rather the federal appeals be resolved first before further proceedings at the state level to avoid conflicting rulings. the players' attorney is pushing for a trial before the regular season begins on sept. 13; if that's not possible, they want it delayed again until the season is over. the williamses have acknowledged taking starcaps, which contained an unlisted but illegal ingredient called bumetanide that can mask the presence of steroids; they're not accused of taking steroids, however. their original lawsuit was dismissed in federal court, but their claims that the suspensions would violate minnesota employment laws were sent back to state court. the nfl didn't tell players that starcaps contained the banned substance, but it claims that players are responsible for what they take and that the collective bargaining agreement that is in place should dictate the punishment. whew. no wonder their focus is on football: this is almost too complicated to think about anyway. \"we don't worry about that,\" teammate <mark>ray edwards</mark> said. \"it's just no issue for us. we know who they are, and that's what matters the most. they come out here and play every day. that's the <mark>pat</mark> and <mark>kevin</mark> i've been seeing for the last three years .\" fellow defensive end <mark>jared allen</mark> refuses to dwell on the what-if possibility, either. \"we're professionals. you're not supposed to get distracted. things are going to happen. this is the nfl. people are going to get replaced year in and year out. it's just part of the job,\" <mark>allen</mark> said. for as much attention brett favre's will-he-or-won \"t-he saga received over the last three months as the still-retired quarterback mulled the opportunity to come to minnesota, the uncertainty of the williamses' status has dragged on much longer. it's an equally important issue, too, central to the success of this year's team .\" we would like for it to come to an end and put it behind us, \"defensive coordinator leslie frazier said .\" i know for their sake they would like to put it behind them and not miss any time. hopefully it will come to a resolution pretty soon here. hopefully we aren't going into september not knowing if these guys will be suspended. \"if so, letroy guion, <mark>fred evans</mark> and <mark>jimmy kennedy</mark> would be next in line to fill the spots. frazier said he's confident in their abilities .\" it will be a bit of a drop off, \"frazier said .\" it will be hard to replace <mark>pat</mark> and <mark>kevin</mark>, because those are hall of fame defensive

facebook users panicked as the sites went down thursday several online social networks were the victims of cyber-attacks one twitter user says she felt \"naked\" without her micro-blog another says he felt \"jittery\" during the time twitter was down by john d. sutter cnn (cnn)--christina cimino was logging onto twitter on thursday morning when something happened that she found deeply unsettling. ireporter <mark>david seaman</mark> says twitter needs a competitor so users don't panic when it goes down. \"i got some weird error message, and i'm like,\" what's going on!? \"the 24-year-old said. that error message was the scourge of online social networkers worldwide on thursday as cyber-attacks shut down twitter and caused sustained glitches in other social-media sites like facebook and the blogging site livejournal. twitter co-founder biz stone wrote the sites were the victims of what\" appears to be a single, massively coordinated attack. \"and a pro-georgian blogger, whose accounts on facebook and twitter reportedly were the targets of the denial-of-service attack, told cnn the online strike was timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the russia-georgia conflict. what may prove more lasting about the day social networking suffered its first major blackout is the degree to which people cared. near-panic erupted in some corners of the internet as people lost cherished links to their online friends, family members and news feeds. watch cnn ireporters talk about the attack part of the panic relates to the sheer popularity of the sites. twitter saw a more than 1,300 percent jump in unique visitors between february 2008 and february 2009, according to nielsen netview. the site, which lets users post messages of 140 characters or less, had more than 44 million worldwide users in june, according to comscore. more than 120 million users log onto facebook at least one time each day, the site says. to be sure, not all facebook and twitter users freaked out because of the attacks. some people even reveled in the mayhem. don't miss pro-georgia blogger\" george' target of twitter attack twitter hit by denial-of-service attack but for people like cimino, who said she \"felt naked\" without access to twitter, the attacks were a serious reality check--a chance to evaluate just how dependent they'd become. \"you know how you pat your pockets for your cell phone and your keys? well it's that same kind of phantom [limb] with twitter,\" she said. \"it's like,' i can't update! i can't update!' it's just one of those bugs that gets in you .\" she added: \"i was pretty upset, actually. it feels like a lifeline for me...pretty much everyone knows almost every detail of my life by what i'm doing on twitter .\" it's not worth analyzing whether these online connections are good or bad because the reality is that twitter and facebook are now an important part of our lives, said marc cooper, a journalism professor at the university of southern california's annenberg school for communication. \"for many people, and not just young people, the web is not just media, it's actually a place where they conduct their lives or a portion of their lives,\" he said. \"so the panic [thursday] morning is only reflective of that. this is not just a hobby or an amusement or another accoutrement, it's actually deeply woven into their lives and is integral to their social interaction. so when it's cut off, it's a problem .\" others saw twitter's existence as the problem and relished the chance to make fun of a web site that has become so omnipresent in news cycles. \"horrors!!! people will have to communicate face to face!\" one user commented on cnn's scitech blog. another commenter said, \"turn off your computers and read a book or get outside and discover there is more to life than cyberspace. the internet has become nothing more than the new cocaine .\" now that twitter is back online, the no. 1 conversation thread on the site is called \"whentwitterwasdown,\" where users discuss what they did without their real-time twitter updates. some people are mocking the blackout. a user named paulwilks, for instance, wrote, \"i took up juggling .\" others seem concerned. \"i did absolutely nothing. it's like my heart was gone,\" wrote a user named harajukuxbarbie. \"i felt so empty inside,\" wrote another twitter user called freinhar. some business people on thursday realized just how much they depend on facebook and twitter to do their work. adam ostrow, editor-in-chief at mashable, a blog that covers social media, said the outage made it difficult for his organization to cover the news and to promote its stories. \"for someone like myself who spends all day on twitter, it's incredibly frustrating,\" he told cnn.com live. justin stauffer, a 31-year-old who works in web strategy at a marketing company near philadelphia, pennsylvania, said thursday's attack made him realize just how dependent on twitter he had become. \"when something that's so central to how you do your business or how you gather information goes down, yeah, you get a little jittery--like, when's it going to be back,\" he said. \"i didn't break out in hives or anything like that,\" he said, jokingly. <mark>david seaman</mark>, an ireporter in new york, said he thinks twitter needs a competitor so users will have an alternative if the site is down. watch <mark>seaman</mark>'s talk about the issue on cnn's ireport and amy gahran, who writes about social media on a blog called contentious, said all technologies can break down, so people need to make contingency plans. \"hell, when you get down to it, you can lose your voice or break your writing hand or have a stroke and be unable to communicate. we are fundamentally social creatures, and when we lack our usual communication channels it's scary,\" she writes. \"don't panic. have a backup plan, and be prepared .\" cooper, the usc professor, said the fuss surrounding thursday's attack is a sign that instant, online communication is here to stay. fighting the trend would be like trying to stop the ocean's tides, he said, but it's unclear where the technology will take our society. \"the bottom line is that we don't know. all of this is too new,\" he said. \"it's like sitting around in the year 1500 and trying to figure out where the printing press was going to take us .\" e-mail to a friend share this on: mixx facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon | mixx it | share", "articleID": "2009080716_00052034_W", "names": {"David Seaman":
