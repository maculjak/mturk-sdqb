(knee) and wide receiver <mark>anthony armstrong</mark> (hamstring) did not practice for the dolphins. thomas and mcdaniel are officially out for sunday's game and <mark>armstrong</mark> is listed as doubtful? linebacker (groin) both participated in a full practice and are being listed as probable? for the raiders, cornerback ron bartell (shoulder) and wide receiver jacoby ford (foot) did not practice and are out for the game .? running back <mark>taiwan jones</mark> (ribs), linebacker rolando mcclain (ankle) wide receiver juron criner (ankle), long snapper jon condo (concussion) and center <mark>alex parsons</mark> (shoulder) were limited and are questionable for sunday .? tight ends david ausberry (shoulder) and brandon myers (shoulder), safety <mark>michael mitchell</mark> (ribs), defensive tackle <mark>richard seymour</mark> (knee), wide receiver denarius moore (hamstring) and kicker sebastian janikowski (hamstring) all practiced in full and are listed as probable. coach speak \"i think he's got an excellent future in this league. he's progressing nicely. he's a good football player, moves well. we use the term\" he moves like a football player. \"the kid moves like a running back. he's got good balance and a little bit of base, keeps his feet in pretty close contact with the ground and he's got some speed and can catch the ball he's got some ability .\" \"you know the oakland raiders probably since the days i remember (with cliff branch), that's a big part of their game and they've got those guys on the outside, on the perimeter that can run, so obviously angles are going to be important. and again it's based on what coverage we're in. are we in a two-deep or are we in a one-high? is it man or is it zone? but it's safe to say those safeties are going to have to be active. if it's two-deep they're going to have to be able to get off the hash and provide help and get over there and make a play on the ball. if it's one-high they're obviously not going to be quite as close but still they should be factor on those balls downfield .\" - <mark>philbin</mark> how raiders quarterback carson palmer's ability to throw the deep ball will impact miami's safety \"i thought they played well the other day. we clearly won that phase; i'm convinced of that. they had a huge impact play with the touchdown return. we started the game off right, though we had a penalty on the first return, but our kickoff coverage team did a great job. there were a lot of positives in the film. the effort was exceptional, the play speed. i thought they got off to an excellent start. certainly we have room for improvement and things we've got to get better, but they played winning football .\" - <mark>philbin</mark> on the play of his special teams locker room talk \"definitely i'm excited being able to play in front of the home crowd and i'm familiar with the stadium obviously. i might actually be there as a fan saturday to watch the university of miami play bethune-cookman. my parents will be there to support me and they always have the best tailgates before the game, but they always save the leftovers for me so i'm looking forward to that .\" on playing his first home regular-season game in the nfl \"that definitely reassuring to me and lets me know that my guys know what we're doing and who they have and i feel protected. i feel safe back there, so every time i catch the ball. i know that somebody's blocking somebody and it makes me want to do better for them .\" on what he learned after watching film of his 72-yard punt return for a touchdown at houston \"i think <mark>seymour</mark>'s a great player. he is big, he's quick and he's strong and he can rush the passer and can shed blocks well. it's going to be a good test for us. every time he's played us it's been a big test. he was a great player with the patriots and he's a great player with oakland so wherever he's at he's going to do a good job .\" on facing raiders defensive tackle <mark>richard seymour</mark> ##around five or six months ago, bess got a tattoo on his back of his jersey number 15 that was done to the precise dimensions of his actual jersey. he said it's now a permanent reminder of how hard he worked to make the dolphins roster since that was the number assigned to him back in 2008, saying it was the second hardest thing he had done his life behind getting back into college football after being incarcerated. \"it keeps me humble and it keeps me grounded,\" said bess, who turned down a healthy offer from <mark>brandon marshall</mark> two years ago to give up his number. \"it's deeper than money and means too much too me .\" ", "articleID": "2012091503_00011899_W", "names": {"Richard Seymour": ["Q23657219", "Q2606618", "Q28421769",

teachers strike grinds into third day in chicago, teachers strike grinds into third day with no hint of imminent deal partisan jibes on hold for 9/11 - but not politics for 9/11: presidential campaigns suspend partisan digs, but politics continues on anniversary associated press madrid (ap) - tens of thousands of people from all over spain rallied in the capital saturday against punishing austerity measures enacted by the government, which is trying to save the country from financial collapse. large anti-austerity protests also took place in neighboring portugal. demonstrators in lisbon threw tomatoes and fireworks at the portuguese headquarters of the international monetary fund. two protesters were arrested, but otherwise the rally was peaceful. spain is stuck in a double-dip recession with unemployment close to 25 percent. the conservative government of prime minister mariano rajoy has introduced stinging cuts and raised taxes in a bid to reduce the deficit and to reassure investors and officials from the 17-nation eurozone. the marchers in madrid unfurled banners with slogans such as \"let's go! they are ruining the country and we have to stop them .\" \"this government's policies are causing too much pain,\" union chief ignacio fernandez toxo said. \"it's a lie that there isn't another way to restore the economy .\" the situation looks set to get worse in coming weeks. at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in cyprus on friday, spain revealed it would present a new set of economic reforms by the end of the month. it's a move that raises expectations that spain might soon ask for financial help. the economic reform plan will be unveiled by sept. 27. it is expected to be the launch-pad to spain's tapping of a new european central bank bond-buying plan. just before saturday's march began, buses transporting protesters blocked several major roads in the spanish capital. the main organizers were social summit, an association of more than 150 organizations, and the workers' commissions and general workers trade unions. the interior ministry's regional office said it had expected more than 500,000 people to reach a central madrid square, but later said 65,000 had attended to listen to speeches made by protest leaders. toxo called for a referendum on the government's austerity and bailout plans, saying the measures were so different from the ruling popular party's election pledges that spaniards should have the right to express an opinion on them. rajoy was swept to power with a large majority in november elections, having said \"i have no plans to raise taxes .\" the madrid protest comes four days after another anti-government gathering in the northeastern city of barcelona that attracted about 1.5 million demonstrators, according to police estimates. \"we've had our pay cut. we don't get the firefighting training and equipment we need. there are more students and fewer teachers in our children's classrooms, and health care is also being cut,\" firefighter carlos melgaves said, while marching in a group of about 50 firefighters. \"we can't take it anymore .\" spain's economy minister, luis de guindos, said his government is aware it is asking citizens to make sacrifices. they \"are absolutely unavoidable if we are to correct the difficult economic climate we are experiencing,\" he said in cyprus, where europe's finance ministers were meeting saturday. \"we are laying the foundations for a recovery .\" rajoy has accepted a loan of up to? 100 billion ($127billion) to help ailing banks reeling from a collapse of the country's real estate and construction industries. his government also has faced punishingly high interest rates while raising money on bond markets to keep the economy in liquidity. the country is widely expected to ask to sell its bonds to the european central bank, but the conditions attached have been the subject of ongoing negotiations. in portugal, another package of recently announced government austerity measures could turn the nation's sullen acceptance of belt-tightening into an explosion of anger similar to that seen in greece over the past two years. more than 50,000 people said on facebook they would attend a large protest in lisbon and organizers called smaller demonstrations in 40 other portuguese cities. last week, portuguese prime minister pedro passos coelho announced an increase in workers' social security contributions to 18 percent of their monthly salary from 11 percent. the cut is equivalent to a net monthly wage. portuguese finance minister vitor gaspar said income taxes will go up next year and public employees will lose either their christmas or vacation bonus, roughly equivalent to a month's income. many pensioners will lose both. protester magda alves said the austerity measures being applied to overcome the eurozone financial crisis were not working. \"what is being done in portugal now was done in greece, it is being done in spain, and was also applied in other countries on other continents,\" alves said. \"the result was always the same: disaster .\" ___ associated press writers barry hatton

has competed in seven kl and malaysian opens and crashed out in the first round in six of them. he made the final of the malaysian open in 2010 but lost to former national no. 1 mohd azlan iskandar. in yesterday's final, the early exchanges seemed to point to another disappointment for world no. 19 momen as he found himself in trouble early on, trailing world no. 8 shorbagy 10-7. the 24-year-old momen, widely regarded as the quickest player in the world of squash, however, saved three game balls before wrapping up the set 12-10. it was touch-and-go in the next three sets as the players set the stage for a dramatic finale. momen again found himself on the back foot but he miraculously saved two match balls before sealing his biggest career win. it was also his second title in two weeks, having captured the columbian open earlier this month. \"i'm over the moon right now...winning two titles in two weeks. i really want to carry this good form into my next tournaments,\" said momen.

your inbox rosy future...sunderland loan star <mark>danny rose</mark>. published on monday 17 september 2012 09:20 debutant <mark>danny rose</mark> hopes his loan switch to sunderland will result in a permanent move to the stadium of light. england under-21 left-back <mark>rose</mark> made his black cats bow in saturday's 1-1 draw with liverpool after arriving on a season-long loan from spurs on transfer deadline day. the loan deal has no clause regarding a permanent transfer, and <mark>rose</mark> has not been given any indication from sunderland boss <mark>martin o'neill</mark> that he sees him as part of his long-term plans. but the doncaster-born playing is already looking to stay on wearside by impressing <mark>o'neill</mark> after seeing sunderland's ambition in the transfer market this summer. <mark>rose</mark> told the gazette: \"if there was a chance that i could move here permanently, i'd snatch it with both hands .\" nothing has been said of that kind. i'm just here on loan for the season, and anything after that would be a bonus. \"the gaffer just asked me to come here on loan and said i'd play more games here than i would at spurs, which is right .\" i've just got to take it game by game, and see where it takes me. \"i had interest from a couple of clubs, but once i saw the signings that sunderland had made, it was a no-brainer, and with being closer to my family as well, that helps .\" <mark>adam johnson</mark> has come from man city. he could have gone to a host of premier league clubs, but he came here. \"louis saha i was with last season, and they paid big money for <mark>steven fletcher</mark>. it just shows sunderland's intent for the season .\" <mark>rose</mark> underwent treatment on a groin strain at the academy of light yesterday - an injury which proved costly to sunderland's hopes of recording a first league victory of the campaign. the 22-year-old was struggling with the problem for several minutes before he was beaten by liverpool winger raheem sterling on the right-hand touchline, who crossed for <mark>luis suarez</mark> to level for the visitors. <mark>rose</mark> was honest enough to admit he was at fault for the goal, but says liverpool merited a point after piling on the pressure in the second half following <mark>fletcher</mark>'s third in two games for the black cats. \"just before the goal, i told <mark>john o'shea</mark> i was struggling with my groin,\" said <mark>rose</mark>. \"i said i'd give it five more minutes and look what happened .\" i don't think it's too bad, it just seems tight. i might have over-stretched for a ball, i don't know. \"hopefully when everything settles down with my body, we can assess it .\" he added: \"i was a bit disappointed with the goal which was my fault .\" i should have done better out wide and it's ricocheted off titus (bramble) and he's (<mark>suarez</mark>) tapped it in. \"it just shows at this level that you let your opponent get the better of you once, he puts it in the box and liverpool scored .\" liverpool did dominate if i'm honest. they play good football. \"obviously they've been a big unlucky with their results so far, but they dominated and we were happy with a point. transfer rumours: sunday september 9: man united, cristiano ronaldo, arsenal, theo walcott, chelsea, swansea, liverpool temperature: 7 c to 16 c wind speed: 21 mph this
