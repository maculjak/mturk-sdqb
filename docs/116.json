(ap photo) free agency is over for <mark>richards</mark>, but if he thought this process was tough, wait until he sees what's next. he's now been identified as the variable that takes the rangers from an early-round exit to a championship team. now, it's on him to make it happen. when the rangers were eliminated from the playoffs, coach john tortorella sat down and identified a few needs to get over the hump. an elite center. someone to run the power play. a mentor for the rangers' young developing forwards. <mark>richards</mark> addresses all three, and that's why the rangers and <mark>richards</mark> were the ideal fit compared to the other finalists like the toronto maple leafs, los angeles kings, calgary flames and tampa bay lightning. he can take the rangers from good to great. he addresses real needs, which wasn't necessarily the case in tampa bay or los angeles. it's the perfect fit--assuming he's able to withstand the responsibility. he's playing in a market unlike any other he's played in his career with a pressure he's never faced. this isn't dallas or tampa. this is new york, and the expectation has now become a stanley cup. \"it's going to be a challenge for sure. it's going to be something different, i haven't experienced it,\" he said of the move to a market like new york. \"you want to be a great player, that's something you should relish .\" read: how much does brad richards help the rangers? nhl free agency: my open letter to brad richards after signing with the rangers kings making big push for free agent brad richards gm glen sather deserves credit for landing the best player in free agency, at a time his young, developing team is ready for it. he also gets points for the way he did it. he passed on going to the newport offices in mississauga, ont., with a convoy of people to try and win over the <mark>richards</mark> camp. instead, he made a phone call at 12:01 p.m. et on friday where he made his pitch and first offer. then he watched on television as other teams paraded through the newport office. it couldn't have been easy waiting and knowing convincing pros like kings gm dean lombardi and lightning gm steve yzerman were making a pitch. but the laid-back approach worked. \"i just didn't want it to turn into some kind of scene,\" sather said. \"i just didn't want to get involved in that kind of circus arrangement? we made our presentation and we were straight up .\" on paper, it's perfect. <mark>richards</mark> fills multiple needs. he knows and likes the coach. he says he feels great and fully recovered from his concussion and has been training for six weeks. new york needed an elite center, and he was the only one available. the free agency circus is over for <mark>richards</mark> but the spotlight doesn't disappear because his name is on a contract. he chose new york, and he'd better be prepared for what that means. \"what better place to try to perform than madison square garden every night,\" he said. \"that's a dream come true .\" if he can stand the pressure, brad richards a great fit for new york rangers saturday jul 2 for brad richards, the free agency circus is over, but the scrutiny has

researchers to watch protein action in brain cells published: friday, july 8, 2011 - 08:34 in biology & nature researchers at the salk institute have been able to genetically incorporate\" unnatural \"amino acids, such as those emitting green fluorescence, into neural stem cells, which then differentiate into brain neurons with the incandescent\" tag \"intact. they say this new technique, described in the june 16 online issue of stem cells, may help scientists probe the mysteries of many different kinds of stem cells in humans as well as the cells they produce. this could be a boon to both basic and clinical research, such as helping to speed development of stem cell-based regenerative medicine .\" stem cells hold great potential for the treatment of various diseases, yet it has been hard to study how they self renew and produce all of the body's cells, \"says the study's senior author, dr. <mark>lei wang</mark>, assistant professor and frederick b. rentschler developmental chair in the chemical biology and proteomics laboratory .\" the ability to genetically incorporate unnatural amino acids in stem cell proteins will accelerate our understanding the signaling networks that control these stem cells. \"he says, thorough understanding of these mechanisms is critical for safe and reliable stem cell therapeutics. the study's first author, dr. bin shen, adds that the incorporation of unnatural amino acids\" allows researchers to study a particular protein in a living cell or organism, compared to the traditional biochemical methods which are conducted through in vitro settings such as a test tube. \"these studies can also be conducted in real-time, says shen, who is a postdoctoral researcher in <mark>wang</mark>'s lab. use of unnatural amino acids (uaas) was developed by <mark>wang</mark> and his colleagues, and was first used in bacteria in 2001, and in mammalian cells in 2007. this is the first report of its use in stem cells. salk chemists, molecular and cell biologists, and experts in protein structure collaborated on this study, which was conducted in two stages. the first stage was to see if uaas could be incorporated into neural stem cells, without disrupting their process of differentiation, and if so, would the fluorescent tag they inserted be carried into neuronal cells created by the stem cells .\" current methods for uaa incorporation are not appropriate for stem cells, because the added genes are often lost before the stem cell has a chance to finish differentiation, \"<mark>wang</mark> says. to solve that problem, the researchers developed a lentiviral-based gene delivery method to incorporate the uaas into proteins expressed in neural stem cells .\" the lentiviral gene therapy technique, which was pioneered by dr. inder verma at salk, can afford long-lasting expression through stem cell differentiation, \"<mark>wang</mark> says. the virus was used to deliver different components needed in the uaas technology. these consisted of a synthetic transfer rna (trna) that cells use to incorporate amino acids into a protein that is being built inside a cell. the second molecule is an enzymatic synthetase that can recognize the engineered trna, and load it with the third engineered molecule - an unnatural amino acid. these amino acids are chemically distinct from the 20 amino acids that naturally exist in the body; they can be engineered for different desirable properties, such as to fluoresce .\" once you have a stem cell line stably incorporating uaas, you can custom the uaa to study stem cell biology, \"<mark>wang</mark> says .\" you also get the bonus of obtaining various mature cells with this ability through differentiation, such as neurons, which are difficult to insert uaas in and expensive to procure in large amounts. \"in the first set of experiments, the researchers found out that uaas were successfully incorporated into neural stem cells, the incorporation lasted through the differentiation, and these cells then produced neurons carrying the fluorescent amino acid. the second set of experiments was to demonstrate how these uaas can be used to help solve a biological question. the researchers wanted to know how voltage-sensitive ion channels, which are pore forming proteins, work in neurons. in these nerve cells, membrane ion channels respond to changes in electric current - the charged signal that is passed between neurons - that either activate or silence the neurons .\" we are trying to understand how the electric field of cell membranes can turn on or turn off protein activities - like a switch in a house turns on or off lights, \"<mark>wang</mark> says. to study this phenomenon, the researchers embedded a fluorescent uaa into a protein domain that ion channel and other proteins used to sense the electric field in neural stem cells, which produced neurons with the same embedded uaa. they could then watch, in real time, the fluorescent tag given changes in electrical current across the neuron .\" we detected changes in fluorescence intensity of the uaa when the neurons were stimulated, and these changes are dependent on where the uaa was incorporated, which hint that different positions of the protein are moving into or outside of the membrane in response to the electric field. \"<mark>wang</mark> says this experiment, designed to demonstrate the power of uaas in brain cells, can also be adapted to study other membrane proteins in other cells, no matter where they exist in the body. source: salk

credit for time served with the space shuttles retiring, houston has a problem: what becomes of space city? by lisa leff associated press san francisco (ap) - federal officials no longer plan to contest joint bankruptcy pleadings brought by legally married same-sex couples, a department of justice spokeswoman said friday. the obama administration's recent position is that the federal law forbidding government recognition of same-sex unions is unconstitutional. justice department spokeswoman tracy schmaler said government lawyers decided this week that letting gay and lesbian couples jointly petition for bankruptcy protection is consistent with that stance .\" the department of justice has informed bankruptcy courts that it will no longer seek dismissal of bankruptcy petitions filed jointly by same-sex debtors who are married under state law, \"schmaler said. the shift stems from a case involving two california men who got married when it was briefly legal in 2008 before the state's voters passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. a u.s. bankruptcy trustee initially fought gene balas and <mark>carlos morales</mark>' shared chapter 13 bankruptcy plan on the grounds that the federal defense of marriage act prohibited it. but 20 of the 24 bankruptcy judges in los angeles took the unusual step of disagreeing and ruled last month that the act violated the couple's civil rights. trustee <mark>peter anderson</mark> subsequently appealed, maintaining president barack obama had ordered government lawyers to defend the ban\" unless and until \"congress repeals the act or there is a final judicial ruling striking it down. but <mark>anderson</mark> withdrew his objections in a written filing wednesday. he noted that even a u.s. house of representatives group that has stepped in to defend the marriage act's constitutionality in other cases had decided against taking part in <mark>morales</mark> and balas' case .\" in light of the decision by the (bipartisan legal advisory group) not to participate in this appeal and the availability of other judicial fora for resolution of the constitutional question, the united states trustee has determined that it is not a necessary or appropriate expenditure of the resources of this court and the parties to continue to litigate the appeal, \"<mark>anderson</mark>'s office wrote. even before the justice department arrived at its position this week, another bankruptcy trustee in san diego already had cited the administration's decision to stop defending the defense of marriage act in a request to withdraw her opposition to the bankruptcy pleading of another married gay couple. the department's change in policy already has provided the basis for the government to drop its opposition to an attempt by a same-sex couple to seek joint bankruptcy protection in new york state .\" by having the department change its policy nationwide in response to gene and <mark>carlos</mark>' case, we basically accomplished what it would normally take a supreme court ruling to achieve, \"robert pfister, a lawyer for the los angeles couple. balas, 42, a freelance economics writer, and <mark>morales</mark>, 46, a graphic designer, said friday that having the government recognize their marriage for purposes of declaring bankruptcy has practical and profound implications. they will not have to pay extra court fees to file separate petitions, nor go through the exhausting task of trying to untangle their financial lives, which include joint bank accounts, joint debts and jointly owned real estate. he said, however, that as long as the defense of marriage act and state-level same-sex marriage bans remain in effect, he and his husband are not truly equal. when he was considering taking a job in another state, for instance, he had to consider if their marriage would be recognized for purposes of taxes, hospital visitation, inheritance and other spousal rights .\" if you asked an opposite-sex married couple to move to a state where their relationship would be instantly divorced if they moved from say, california, across the border to arizona, you would see how doma and the patchwork of state laws created a problem for married same-sex couples such as <mark>carlos</mark> and myself, \"he said. obama's stance on doma also was cited this week by a federal appeals court in san francisco that ordered the pentagon to immediately stop enforcing the 17-year-old law that prohibits gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from serving openly in the armed forces. ktre.com rss news feeds rss (really simple syndication) is an easy way for you to keep up with all of your favorite news and information. get news, weather, sports, movie and tv listings,
