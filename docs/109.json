true for zdenek kroca on tuesday night when <mark>mark tyler</mark> pulled off a dramatic penalty save against wrexham to help propel the hatters into the blue square bet premier play-off final, writes <mark>mark wood</mark>. luton may have won the tie 5-1 on aggregate but tuesday night's game was anything but plain sailing. leading 3-0 from the first leg, town were behind after just eight minutes when andy mangan netted before winning a penalty 12 minutes later that could have turned the tie on its head. but <mark>tyler</mark> came to luton's rescue, denying <mark>gareth taylor</mark> from the spot, with kroca revealing: \"i just wished a bit of luck for us .\" in the fa trophy kevin pilkington saved the penalty but their player had a tap in from the rebound and i just wished a little bit of luck for us. \"<mark>tyler</mark> made a great save and after that moment we played well .\" the czech defender admitted luton had started poorly and <mark>tyler</mark>'s save was the turning point. he said: \"it's hard because we knew we were three goals up and they had nothing to lose and scored an early goal .\" the start of the game wasn't what we wanted. \"we were a little bit nervous and under pressure .\" then from the penalty they had a great chance to extend their lead. \"thanks to tyles who saved a penalty and kept us in the match .\" if they were two-up it would be much more difficult for us. \"kroca then weighed in with a 29th-minute equaliser on the night to all but kill off the red dragons. he said:\" i'm happy that i scored and helped the team to be a little bit more confident. \"i think the keeper made the wrong decision. he took a step forward and i just tried to hit the target and scored over him .\" we calmed down after this goal and it lifted our confidence - we were the best side after the goal. \"they needed to score three goals again and i think after the goal we were the better side .\" we should score more than the two goals. we thought we played the best second half of the two teams. \"kroca was also full of praise for town's fans, adding:\" it was a big game and a big crowd. they supported us. \"athough we were one goal down they still believed in us and we have to say thank you for supporting us. temperature: 6 c to 16 c wind speed: 25 mph terms and conditions all rights reserved? this website and its associated newspaper

of the health care \"experiment\" he implemented while governor and slammed the obama administration's health care reform law as a federal \"power grab .\" the potential gop presidential contender said he would \"issue waivers for all 50 states\" to opt-out of health care reform on his first day in office should he be \"lucky\" enough to become president. he expressed the same sentiment in an op-ed for usa today thursday, which explicitly detailed his five-point plan. romney faced down criticism from fellow gop hopefuls including former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum, and former arkansas gov. mike huckabee as well as possible questions from conservative voters whom he may rely on for support, should he choose to run. he opened his address at the university of michigan in ann arbor with an explanation of how the massachusetts plan differs from one-year old health care reform. he joked that some may ask \"i heard that your plan in massachusetts is a lot like president obama's plan,\" and question why he's so anxious to repeal it. and romney responded with a lesson in american history. \"the people in america are sovereign,\" he said, explaining that the framers decided \"states would be the laboratories of democracy and compete with one another .\" \"i'm convinced that the obama administration fundamentally doesn't believe in that american experiment,\" he continued. \"they distrust that states are the ones with the power to decide .\" romney countered criticism by asserting that the massachusetts plan was such an experiment. though his action was \"a plan for the state of massachusetts,\" he described health care reform law as \"a power grab by the federal government .\" according to romney, the differences between his plan and obama's are many, but similarities exist as well-and he's not willing to apologize for one of them. though he \"respects\" those who believe he should've taken a different course as governor and realizes that his explanation is \"not going to satisfy everyone,\" he would not reject the individual insurance mandate included in the massachusetts plan--the pesky similarity to federal health care reform that serves as fodder for criticism from both sides of the aisle. \"it wouldn't be honest,\" romney said. \"i, in fact, did what i thought was right for the people of our state .\" the 2008 presidential candidate attempted to put distance between the president and himself, while moving closer to his base, by calling the health care reform law \"an economic nightmare\" and the reason \"why this recession has taken to so long to move on from .\" romney insisted that his reform would \"share some of the objectives\" of the plan proposed by house budget committee chair <mark>paul ryan</mark>, which he touted as including choice, inserting market dynamics, and keeping medicare solvent. romney's silver bullet solution to health care reform is to drive costs down by encouraging \"the consumer to care about the cost and the quality\" of their own health care, and to \"get healthcare to work like a market .\" in the end, he's confident that voters will see it his way. \"if i am the nominee on the republican side of the aisle and i get the chance to debate president obama, this is what we're going to talk about,\" he said. \"i'm confident that the people will say the mitt romney u.s. reforms, that's a lot better than obamacare .\" one potential opponent for romney wasted no time in issuing a response to his speech. santorum released a statement following romney's remarks the criticized his \"work to institute the precursor to national socialized medicine .\" \"both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden,\" santorum said. chinese conjoined twins fight for survival could vampire bat spit save stroke victims? administrators at a tazewell county school evacuated classes after a

al east, the boston red sox are finding that reaching .500 in may after an 0-6 start feels a-ok. kevin youkilis hit a tying three-run homer, <mark>david ortiz</mark> had a go-ahead drive and the red sox completed a sweep of a team in turmoil, beating the new york yankees with a 7-5 victory sunday night to even their record for the first time this season. \"actually feels good. hopefully this is a step in us moving forward,\" red sox manager terry francona said. \"it's not really what our goal is but we're making strides. we played a good series .\" jon lester (5-1) shrugged off a slow start to beat new york again and jarrod saltalamacchia hit his first homer with boston as the red sox swept a three-game series in the bronx for the first time since april 2004. \"that's what people expect us to do,\" <mark>ortiz</mark> said. \"when you combine good hitting with good pitching, as you saw, you're supposed to win .\" despite jumping out to a 4-1 lead, the yankees matched their longest losing streak since may 2009 by losing their fifth straight - all at home - a slump plagued by shaky defense, a lack of big hits - and a huge mess in the clubhouse. jorge posada was in the middle of the uproar saturday, pulling himself from the lineup about an hour before gametime, saying he needed a day to clear his head after being dropped to ninth in the batting order. the struggling designated hitter apologized sunday to yankees manager joe girardi and general manager brian cashman for his actions on what he characterized as \"a bad day .\" the yankees said they will not punish the five-time all-star and consider the matter closed. cashman said it was time to move on and focus on the red sox and righting the yankees, losers of nine of 12. \"it seems like when things are going bad, they're going bad,\" girardi said. \"we're going to turn it around .\" posada entered as a pinch-hitter to open the eighth and received a sustained ovation. he walked but daniel bard retired the next three batters. jonathan papelbon stopped twice to tie his shoes - much to the ire of the fans remaining - during a perfect ninth to finish for his seventh save. <mark>alex rodriguez</mark> let a ball roll through his legs in the seventh inning for an error, allowing the red sox to take a 6-4 lead - an insurance run they would need in the bottom half. <mark>carl crawford</mark> failed to cleanly pick up <mark>rodriguez</mark>'s double to left field for an error, which gave curtis granderson time to score from first. \"i don't know what the numbers say but we've almost made an error per game here over the last 15 games,\" <mark>rodriguez</mark> said. \"we've hurt ourselves over and over again with the glove and tonight was an example of me not making a very routine play .\" new york has made 13 errors in its past 10 games. but nick swisher struck out against bard with runners on first and second to drop to 0 for 17 with runners in scoring position and two outs this year. since may 2, the yankees are 21 for 95 (.221) with runners in scoring position overall. \"it has been frustrating,\" swisher said of the yankees' struggles, \"but, hey, man, we don't have much time to worry about this .\" even though posada was not in the starting lineup because he was 0 for 24 against lefthanders this season, the bleacher creatures finished their roll call with chants of \"jorge!\" that elicited a cheer from the crowd of 46,945. posada gave a wave from the dugout. posada was first to the top of the dugout steps to greet designated hitter andruw jones, who hammered a pitch from lester deep into the left-field seats leading off the second for a 2-1 lead. granderson connected for a two-run shot four batters later, the first homer lester has allowed against a lefty batter this season. but youkilis spoiled the good vibes at yankee stadium with a three-run shot off <mark>freddy garcia</mark> (2-3) in the third and <mark>ortiz</mark> broke his bat on his seventh homer in the fifth to make it 5-4. big papi was a triple shy of the cycle. \"we're just going out playing good ball right now,\" youkilis said. \"we've come a long way since 0-6 .\" lester settled after a rocky start, giving up just one hit and striking out five after the second inning. he walked two in the sixth between strikeouts but got brett gardner to pop up to first for the third out. lester struck out seven and walked four in six innings to win his fifth straight decision this year and improve to 7-1 against the yankees. the red sox loaded the bases with none out in the second but
