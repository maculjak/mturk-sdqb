Related Stories Burlington builder's \"modernistic'...Adi Development Group is seeking to amend the city's official plan and zoning bylaw for a residential high-density site at 4853 Thomas Alton Blvd., just off Appleby Line. A statutory public meeting was held at city hall last week where staff presented an information report on the application. Those from the affected Ward 6 neighbourhood, as well as Adi's solicitor Denise Baker of Weir Folds LLP, delegated the community and corporate services committee .' I think we need to look at this with open eyes and consider the fact that we do have people who are aging in place, and we do have needs for affordable housing, and there may be opportunities for transit' Ward 6 Councillor Blair Lancaster\" They (the builder) need to take into consideration our concerns around parking, concerns around schooling and concerns around safety when it comes down to (emergency) evacuations, \"said resident Dhruv Koch .\" We understand that there needs to be development, and development is good, but what we do not understand is why is there a need for high density and creating these buildings out in our Alton village. \"Much like Adi's proposal to build a 26-storey tower at 374 Martha Street, plans for two 19-storey condominiums, 498 units in total, on Thomas Alton is nearly double the maximum permitted building height of 10 storeys. The 4.96-acre property purchased from Emery Homes also includes 160 stacked townhouse units, 21 stacked towns and 12 back-to-backs. Adi is seeking amendments to allow an overall density on the site of 344 units per hectare, among other site-specific changes. Maximum residential density is set currently at 185 units per hectare. Mayor Rick Goldring asked Baker what community residents stand to gain from a development being built with this proposed density .\" The benefits to the community, to the city, are of course intensification, which is a provincial objective, \"she said .\" There are benefits...in terms of compatibility as it abuts the adjacent properties to the east. \"Similarly in tone, several councillors questioned if Adi would work to address some of the concerns raised regarding traffic. Baker said only preliminarily comments had been received from the city's planning staff but that her client was open to working with the city .\" The planning process is always an iterative process, \"Baker said .\" We have those discussions in consultation with planning staff, and planning staff as well as my client take into consideration all of the comments of the community. \"Adi's application was sent to the city on Oct. 21, 2015, and about 40 residents attended a neighbourhood meeting at Corpus Christi Secondary School in early December. Many of the same people were at city hall to plead their case to city councillors. Ward 6 Councillor Blair Lancaster said in her view it is clear the proposal is\" overdeveloped \"but that any solution must also consider the fact that the demographics in Alton are changing .\" I think we need to look at this with open eyes and consider the fact that we do have people who are aging in place, and we do have needs for affordable housing, and there may be opportunities for transit, \"Lancaster said .\" We have to find a way to make this work for the community. \"Part of the proposal is predicated on the zoning bylaw amendment to allow road access off Thomas Alton Boulevard and Palladium Way. Alton resident, and local real estate agent, Andrea Florian said she was already concerned about traffic safety issues in her community that aren't being addressed .\" Palladium Way's a racetrack right now, \"she said, questioning the two access points to the proposed development .\" It's extremely dangerous and I'm surprised more cops haven't advantage of the drag racing that goes on there on the weekends. \"City staff had already raised concerns about a traffic study that was completed at off-peak times during March Break as well as last summer. Baker noted her client had already made adjustments to parking allotments in response conversations with city planners and the community .\" A number of concerns were raised with respect to the traffic study in terms of the parking counts that were done, \"Baker said .\" That has been revised to include additional parking counts and a copy of that study has been or is about to be resubmitted to the (city) for their consideration...\"According to the previously submitted traffic study, consultants for Adi accounted for a 15 per cent reduction in trip generation to account for\" non-auto oriented trips. \"Burlington Transit also operates Route 15 in the area, and Adi has told the Post it is considering a car-share program on site .\" We wouldn't be able to put in a proposal for this density if it wasn't able to be justified by traffic studies without appropriate mitigation, \"Baker said. Commercial amenities, such as grocery stores, shopping and restaurants are still a world away across a busy Appleby Line .\" We have to get into our car to access any kind of shopping, any kind of amenity, \"Florian said .\" We can't even buy a bag of milk without having to get into our car right now. \"It also remains to be seen what solutions could be found for accommodating more families in the local public and Catholic schools. Burlington's director of planning and building, Mary Lou Tanner, said there is a balance to be struck between enrolment projections and new developments .\" I think the dynamic we're seeing in Alton is there's multiple families living in some of the homes, \"she said .\" We want to be mindful that as children age, we want to have a sustained population base so the school does remain open and active. \"Tanner said there is value in having a mix of housing in a neighbourhood, and not everyone can afford a single-detached home .\" We want to be able to provide that range of housing. It is an important point because there are so few apartment buildings, and apartment sites in Alton, \"she said .\" I think it's also important to remember as family members age that we want them to age in neighbourhood. We don't want people having to move to other parts of any city, or this city, just because they can't find their chosen housing type. \"The question is size, scale, massing and quality of design and that's what we're going to focus on because when we get that right we can manage the traffic .\" <mark>Michael Gregory</mark> is a reporter with the Burlington Post.

This OZY series takes you to the nations and individuals driving innovative solutions at the New Climate Change Frontiers. By Leslie Hook, Victor Mallet and Yasemin Craggs Mersinoglu The Daily Dose AUG 20 2019 When Greta Thunberg started a solo climate protest outside Sweden's parliament building last year, no one imagined it would spark a global movement that led to her being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. But as she sailed for the U.S. last Wednesday, having quit flying for environmental reasons, the 16-year-old has become the figurehead for European climate activism as the continent experiences a groundswell in support for Green parties. Thunberg's prominence has grown during 2019 as she has crisscrossed the continent to lobby political leaders and rally her young supporters as part of the weekly #FridaysForFuture school strikes. Yet the number and vehemence of her detractors have grown with her. Over the past 12 months, I suspect she has got a lot more airtime than the polar bear. <mark>Mike Hulme</mark>, a professor at Cambridge University The teenager--whose fame can be measured by the fact that she is almost always referred to by her first name only--has become a lightning rod for criticisms that are likely to intensify when she arrives in the more politically charged U.S. for next month's U.N. climate summit in New York. \"You can think of Greta as the new icon of climate change,\" said <mark>Mike Hulme</mark>, a professor at Cambridge University. \"Over the past 12 months, I suspect she has got a lot more airtime than the polar bear .\" The most vociferous attacks on Thunberg have come from far-right politicians and conservative writers. During a visit last month to France, when she addressed legislators, one lawmaker dismissed Thunberg as a \"prophetess in short trousers\" who would win a \"Nobel Prize for fear,\" while another called her an \"apocalyptic guru .\" Days later, an Australian columnist called her the \"deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement,\" prompting Thunberg to hit back. \"I am indeed\" deeply disturbed' about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on, \"the teenage activist wrote in a Twitter post .\" Where are the adults? \"And yet Thunberg's message has resonated across much of Europe, striking a chord with young people and a public that is increasingly concerned about climate breakdown and environmental issues. This summer, the U.K. and France adopted targets to cut carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050, and the Greens in Germany now have more political support than any other party. Thunberg's journey to New York on board the 60-foot carbon-fiber racing yacht Malizia II, with a small crew including skipper Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi, nephew of Prince Albert of Monaco, is expected to take two weeks .\" It will be quite an adventure, \"she said on Wednesday as she began her journey in Plymouth on England's south coast .\" I expect it will be challenging, maybe seasickness, \"she said, before adding:\" There are people in the world suffering more than that. \"Thunberg is far from a household name in the U.S., where opinion polls show growing concern about climate change but a wide gap between Republicans and Democrats on the issue. <mark>Richard Black</mark>, director at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit and author of Denied: The Rise and Fall of Climate Contrarianism, said the U.S.'s more polarized political discourse could result in her being targeted for criticism .\" It will be interesting to see whether there is any paid-for anti-Greta advocacy, \"he said, pointing to the funding for anti-climate action lobbying in the U.S.\" There will be one tranche that absolutely does not welcome her. \"While almost all of her critics are on the right, occasional voices from other parts of the political spectrum have also questioned her influence .\" When you consume Greta, you do not help the planet, \"Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven, a liberal French philosopher, wrote on Twitter a few days ago .\" You play the game of the system that destroys it. \"<mark>Black</mark> said of such reproval:\" She is also an intellectual threat, in that there is a kind of model of the political commentariat, that is used to being taken seriously, and she does not take them seriously. \"Others have asked whether Thunberg has gained excessive prominence. No one could argue about her significant influence: German Chancellor Angela Merkel credited the student protesters as she instructed her Cabinet to examine a carbon net-zero goal .\" It is quite interesting how rapidly she has gained this iconic power--almost mesmerizing power--given how partial and limited her political antenna and skills actually are, \"said <mark>Hulme</mark>.\" She is a legitimate representative, but should not be a hegemonic one. \"Within the youth movement that she inspired--school strikes have taken place in more than 100 countries--fellow activists insist Thunberg has always eschewed a leadership role, even if her speeches, viral tweets and social media posts ensure she remains in the public eye. Last week, Thunberg was among 400 young campaigners who gathered in Switzerland for the first Europe-wide meeting of her school strike movement .\" Everyone here obviously knows [that] Greta was the founder of the movement. But she has always been very specific that she is not the leader, \"said Mai Sheehan, a 16-year-old activist from Ireland .\" All our decisions are made on a consensus basis. \"As if to back this up, Thunberg was nowhere to be seen at the press conference on the final day of the gathering. But the movement she inspired continues to grow, with major global demonstrations planned for Sept. 20 and 27 .\" What often happens with Greta, is that the media frames her role as \"Jesus' and us as\" the disciples, \"' said Leonard Ganz, 21, from Germany .\" This is really a problem. \"He continued:\" She obviously is an inspiration for the movement...[but we] do not have that hierarchy. \"Timeline: Greta's rise to prominence August 2018 Greta Thunberg, 15, begins her protest against government inaction on climate change in front of Sweden's parliament building.

Democrat Conor Lamb led Republican Rick Saccone by 641 votes as of 9 a.m.. He had claimed victory just before 1 a.m. \"It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it. You did it,\" Lamb told supporters in Canonsburg, Pa.. Saccone said late Tuesday that there are also provisional and military absentee ballots that still need to be counted. And if those fail to bring victory, he said, his campaign could seek a recount due to the razor-thin margin of the vote tally. \"We are still fighting the fight. It's not over yet,\" he said. Absentee ballots in Washington County were being counted Wednesday morning. The race--in which a Lamb victory would flip the Republican seat--is considered a bellwether for the November midterms. President Donald Trump handily won the district in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Rep. <mark>Tim Murphy</mark> vacated the seat in October after a scandal involving a staffer. The winner of the race will serve out the remaining 10 months of <mark>Murphy</mark>'s term, but will have to win a new district to continue in November--after an anti-gerrymandering decision last month by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that realigned congressional boundaries.
