She's joined by a dozen sidemen on this session, and she wrote the horn arrangement for \"Aged and Mellow,\" and plays percussion on the tracks 6 and 10. Pianist Mark Shane is a standout and B-3 organist Glenn Patscha plays on three of the 13 tracks on the disc. The tunes range from soul-influenced numbers such as the opener and album title, thru Great American Songbook tunes like \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart,\" to jazz standards such as the closing \"I Cover the Waterfront .\" Generally they come from the jazz age thru the swing era. <mark>Russell</mark> is very big in France, where she earned both the Pris du Jazz Vocal and the Grand Prix du Hot Club de France. This is a versatile singer who can reinvent many of the tunes and is always in tune and doing just the right thing to make every song work. TrackList: Bring It Back; I'm Shooting High; I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart; You Got To Swing and Sway; Aged and Mellow; The Darktown Strutters Ball; Lucille; You've Got Me Under Your Thumb; After The Light Go Down Low; I'm Sticking With You Baby; Strange as it Seems; Public Melody Number One; I Cover The Waterfront. Diane Schuur, known as \"Deedles,\" is getting better every album she does. This CD is devoted to compositions and tunes previously recorded by her two early mentors: Stan Getz and Frank Sinatra. During her 30-year career she has become every bit the graceful and in some ways more subtle singer than she used to be. And she's picked up a most effective scat-singing style on the way. The blind singer really pays very close attention to the lyrics and you may get some meanings out of them that you had never thought of before. She also doesn't try to mimic either the style of Sinatra or any of the amazing solos that Stan Getz played, but she delivers these 11 songs with plenty of enthusiasm and a most swinging approach that will captivate any listener. Alan Broadbent's terrific arrangements and the all-star band help the whole thing along; both these albums make the usual vocalist-and-piano album sound rather lame. With names like Cole Porter, Michael Legrand, Antonio Carlos Jobim, <mark>Jimmy Webb</mark> and Hoagy Carmichael, these tunes can't fail even they weren't made famous by Getz and Sinatra.

The Russian Federation is not a socialist state. But the U.S. military and political establishment still seek to destroy Russia. That's the object of the crisis the Pentagon, State Department and CIA are orchestrating in Ukraine. What drives this seemingly irrational course of action? The same thing that drove the George W. Bush regime to invade Iraq in 2003. The same thing that's driving the violent anti-China rhetoric from the Pentagon and the White House: financial need and cold economic calculation. Not the financial need of the hungry and homeless, of the millions who need jobs at living wages, of those who can't pay their rent or mortgages or who must choose between heating and eating. It's the need of Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs to pump up their profits, stock prices and rates of return on their invested capital amid a global economic slowdown caused by capitalist overproduction. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the United States will replace Russia this year as the world's top hydrocarbon energy producer. It says the U.S. will replace Saudi Arabia as the world's No. 1 oil producer by 2015. This is the result of the U.S. capitalist class investing hundreds of billions of dollars over the past 10 years in fracking - the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas from shale rock. ExxonMobil, the world's most profitable company, spent $41 billion in 2010 to buy fracking giant XTO Energy. ExxonMobil is now the largest U.S. natural gas producer. Chevron, Phillips 66, Valero, Berkshire Hathaway and General Electric are other top 10 Fortune 500 companies betting billions on the superprofits they hope fracking will bring. Some of them have ascended to the top 10 based on these investments. Halliburton, the Koch brothers and hedge funds like KKR are heavily invested. So is every major bank. But these environment-destroying investments would not be profitable without the triple-digit oil prices of the past decade. These record prices were made possible by the violent suppression of Middle East and North African energy production by the Pentagon through war and sanctions. The U.S. invasion of Iraq devastated that country. And it hit hard at working class and oppressed communities in the United States. For Big Oil and Wall Street it was a bonanza. In 2002, before U.S. invaders destroyed Iraq's state-owned oil industry, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, a benchmark used by the oil industry, hovered around $20 a barrel. By April 2003, when U.S. tanks rolled into Baghdad, WTI crude was over $40 a barrel. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the biggest U.S. oil companies, saw their profits rise nearly 300 percent. By mid-2008, war threats and sanctions against Iran combined with the continued wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to drive oil up to $147 a barrel. It was ExxonMobil's most profitable year ever. War in the Middle East made profitable the plunder of Canada's tar sands, the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and new mountaintop removal projects in Appalachia. It enabled the building of the Anglo-U.S.-owned Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline from former Soviet Central Asia to the Mediterranean and new U.S. energy investments in Africa. But capitalists will do what capitalists do. When profits and prices are booming, they will produce \"more than the market can bear .\" The third quarter of 2008 saw a global capitalist economic crisis and oil prices began to fall. Sanctions against Iran and Sudan, the 2011 U.S. / NATO bombing of Libya and the CIA-orchestrated war in Syria, which blocks a potential Iranian oil pipeline to the Mediterranean, have slowed the decline but not reversed it. Some analysts predict prices as low as $50 a barrel by 2015. Oil and natural gas prices tend to move in tandem, and oil prices of $60 to $80 a barrel are needed for most fracking projects to break even. Shale reserves with a value of $26 trillion at today's prices could become worthless. A crisis that disrupts the flow of Russian energy to Europe would change the picture radically. On April 14, CNBC announced \"oil hovers near $108 as Ukrainian crisis worsens .\" \"Cold War' chained Western Europe to U.S.. In the 1970s the Soviet Union was the world's top energy producer. Much of its production was consumed domestically or provided to other socialist countries in barter arrangements. Western Europe relied on Arab and Iranian oil and gas sold by U.S. and British monopolies. In the early 1980s, German and French banks financed a massive Soviet pipeline project, called Urengoi 6, to bring Siberian natural gas to Western Europe. The Reagan regime launched an overt and covert campaign to sabotage the project. (\"A Tale of Two Pipelines,\" Workers World, June 10, 2005) Washington wanted to hurt the Soviet economy, of course. It also wanted to keep Western Europe dependent on U.S. energy monopolies. The project was completed, however, and Soviet natural gas poured into Europe. In 1998, Russia, now capitalist, responded to a speculative attack on its currency by devaluing the ruble. Oil fell below $11 a barrel, throwing the Western oil industry into a panic. The U.S. responded with missiles and bombs. The target was not Russia but Iraq. Within three months the Clinton regime came up with an excuse for a massive bombing campaign against Iraq, which was already suffering from U.S.-orchestrated sanctions. Two years earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had admitted that sanctions had killed 567,000 Iraqi children. She said the \"price was worth it .\" As bombs rained on Iraq, Energy Secretary <mark>William Richardson</mark> was begging U.S. oil executives to build oil and gas pipelines to former Soviet Central Asia to cement U.S. influence there. They told him it would not be worth it unless he could guarantee oil prices above $40 a barrel for a sustained period. It took the 2003 invasion of Iraq to do that. Energy is the world's most profitable commodity. But other interests are at stake. The Pentagon needs to protect and expand its bloated budget, which faces \"mandatory\" cuts in 2016. The generals want to expand NATO to the east and put U.S. troops in the former Soviet Union. The military-industrial complex wants more arms sales to Eastern Europe, with Ukraine as a customer. Then there is the heart of the system - Wall Street itself. Bankers and politicians know that war and crisis abroad drive capital into the United States, cutting the deficit, propping up the dollar and helping keep U.S. banks at the center of the world economy. Wall Street analysts hope and predict that capital flight from Russia alone could reach $150 billion this year, more than twice what it was in 2013. The monopoly-dominated world capitalist market is saturated with commodities and capital. It is in a permanent battle because of a crisis that is unique to the capitalist system: overproduction. Bankers sit on trillions of dollars they cannot reinvest at an \"acceptable\" rate of profit. The world imperialist system cannot absorb the productive capacity of the vast industrial-technological-scientific apparatus that exists in the former Soviet Union - just as it cannot absorb the labor power, the minds and capabilities of hundreds of millions of people around the world. The imperialist market has no room for the Eurasian Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Economic Cooperation Organization or the rising bloc of BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which Iran seeks to join. It has no room for the African Union or the Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples of Our America. The dominant mode of production in the above-mentioned blocs Is capitalist. But an important factor in their economic growth is the state-powered economy of the People's Republic of China, a product of the great socialist revolution of 1949. Moreover, the state-owned sector of Russia's economy has risen to 60 percent under the Putin administration. New! From the pages of Workers World. Download this PDF booklet.

In an in-depth interview with Details, the Josh Hartnett's name has been linked with a few big superhero roles over the years, but things never progressed beyond very early casting rumor. Recently the actor has shied away from big Hollywood blockbusters (he will next appear in the Showtime horror series Penny Dreadful), and in an interesting interview with Details.com Hartnett explains why he became disheartened, and why some of the bigger roles he was linked to caused him to back away. We already knew that there were some whispers of him being up for Kal El in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, but it turns out he was in line to play another couple of massive comic book heroes too! \"Spider-Man was something we talked about.

After allowing an early lead to the Cubs that snapped his 25-inning scoreless streak, <mark>Wainwright</mark> mishandled a tie game and allowed a homer later that built a 6-5 win for the Cubs on Friday at Wrigley Field. Through his first 45 innings and six starts this season, <mark>Wainwright</mark> had allowed a total of six runs. The Cubs got that many in one afternoon. The Cardinals' righty could have become the first pitcher ever to go 7-0 in his career at Wrigley, which is celebrating its centennial all summer. <mark>Wainwright</mark> instead gave the ballpark a belated birthday gift?? 1/2 a first. He had one word to describe the blemish on his North Side record. \"I was just very sloppy,\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> said. \"You're not going to be perfect every time. This was just a bad day. I didn't give my team much of a chance .\" No, but they gave him one. Against Cubs lefty Travis Wood (2-3), the Cardinals rallied to tie the score 2-2 in the third inning. Jhonny Peralta's eighth-inning, two-run homer tightened the game late. The Cardinals failed to advance the tying run from first base in the eighth and never threatened against closer Hector Rondon in the ninth. The bigger misfire, however, was <mark>Wainwright</mark>'s after Peralta's two-out double knotted the score in the top of the third inning. In the bottom of the inning, <mark>Wainwright</mark> did what he rarely does?? 1/2 he walked two batters to fuel a three-run rally that regained the lead for the Cubs for good. Welington Castillo's second of three doubles in the game drove home two of the runs. The Cubs have scored 10 of the 12 runs <mark>Wainwright</mark> (5-2) has allowed this season. \"To go out and give up three runs is very unlike me,\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> said. \"To hand the game back over is something I normally don't do a whole lot of ....Those (walks) are the difference in the game?? 1/2 those two runners. They both end up scoring. We lost by one. As you know, walks are something that I try never to do. If you continue to load the bases bad things are going to happen .\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> arrived at Wrigley two starts removed from a shutout and one removed from a hyperextended knee that kept him from a shutout. He had not allowed a run in his previous three starts and had just become the fourth Cardinals pitcher in history to win five games in the first month of the season. What he was doing, he'd done before, but he'd never done it better. \"He's got so many weapons right now,\" Matheny explained. \"Not just a fastball and curveball, but he's got the cutter and the sinker now, too. The ability to throw them at different speeds with different breaks and at different locations. He fits the essence of pitching in my mind .\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> started the game one inning shy of tying his career for consecutive scoreless innings. He wouldn't get there. Five of the first seven Cubs reached base, and before <mark>Wainwright</mark> got an out in the game Anthony Rizzo had a two-run single for the first of his three RBIs. The feel for multiple pitches and ability to throw them, as Matheny described, to multiple locations and varying speeds just wasn't there. His trusty curve rebelled at times, and <mark>Wainwright</mark> described how he \"just didn't have command over\" several pitches. \"Pitches that were just on the edge or close, from our perspective at least, were not where he wanted or not getting called, one of the two,\" Matheny said. After the Cardinals rallied to tie the score at 2-2, <mark>Wainwright</mark> issued a one-out walk to Rizzo. Starlin Castro followed with a single up the middle. Nate Schierholtz benefited from <mark>Wainwright</mark>'s lack of command and loaded the bases with a walk. <mark>Wainwright</mark> had pitched out of trouble?? 1/2 two runners in scoring position, no outs?? 1/2 in the second, but he couldn't pull off the same trick twice. Rizzo scored on a groundout for the go-ahead run, and Castillo's double pushed the lead to three runs. The Cubs finished with 10 hits in five innings against <mark>Wainwright</mark>, and five of them went for extra bases, including Rizzo's leadoff homer in the fifth. \"When I missed I was over the middle of the plate or falling behind in counts,\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> said. \"That's a team over there that thrives off of middle balls and being in hitter's counts. I gave them both things they wanted .\" The Cubs also benefited from a call and a play in the field. In the second inning, Randal Grichuk raced deep into the right-center gap to get his glove on a potential double. The ball came out of his glove but he clutched it with his arms?? 1/2 until crashing into Wrigley's brick wall and dropping the catch. In the first inning. Luis Valbuena skipped a ball down the first-base line that kicked up chalk ahead of the base before slicing into right field's foul territory. First-base ump Larry Vanover called the ball fair over the bag. Matheny argued, knowing it's one of the few plays he cannot challenge through baseball's expanded replay. Fair or foul calls in front of the umpire will not be reviewed. \"They feel that they don't have the technology to accurately determine if that ball crosses over the bag,\" Matheny said. \"Hard to tell. I'm just thinking pure physics. The video that we did have didn't seem as obvious as what we saw in real time ....I had a feeling that was going to hurt. That's a big swing .\" The Cardinals overcame the two runs it created. They couldn't the do the same for the walks and homer. After Peralta's seventh homer of the season landed in the basket above the wall in center field, Matt Holliday reached first as the tying run with no outs. He did not advance an inch. <mark>Wainwright</mark> started the day one of four pitchers in history with a 6-0 record in his career at Wrigley. None of the three got to 7-0, and because Friday was what his season hasn't been?? 1/2 sloppy, less than perfect?? 1/2 neither did <mark>Wainwright</mark>. The Confines are usually friendlier. \"It's one of my favorite places to pitch, one of my favorite places to go - a lot of atmosphere. I love being here,\" <mark>Wainwright</mark> said. \"I love pitching here. I just don't like pitching games like I just did here .\" ", "articleID": "2014050311_00023129_W", "names": {"Adam Wainwright": ["Q1185516", "Q57305474"]}}, {"date": "2014-05-03", "url": "http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2014/05/03/kentucky-derby-2014-california-chrome-shines-favorite-despite-humble-beginnings/", "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Steve Coburn proudly calls himself a working man, and he'll tell you upfront that he was insulted when a rich stable owner offered him millions of dollars for the racehorse who'd eaten cookies from his hand as a gangly 3-month-old. \"Somebody who's got that much money, just to think they can step in and buy something people have worked so hard to get to?\" Coburn said. \"To me, that was a slap in the face. The no was easy. Not just\" no,' but \"hell no .'\" It might seem strange, the idea of a populist hero as clear favorite in today's Kentucky Derby, a race that fires the dreams of multimillionaire horsemen around the world. But that's California Chrome. His owners, Coburn and <mark>Perry Martin</mark>, are racing novices who spent a grand total of $10,000 to breed their champion. His trainer, Art Sherman, last saw Churchill Downs as an 18-year-old stable hand and never expected to make it back. They've spent a giddy week telling their colt's story to anyone who asks - how Coburn and <mark>Martin</mark> met when they bought California Chrome's mother, an untalented Maryland-bred racer named Love the Chase; how Sherman thought the men were a touch nuts when they told him the young thoroughbred had a brilliant future. Thousands of long-shot tales bubble up every year, and almost none of them end anywhere near the starting gate of the Kentucky Derby. Yet here they are with the one horse that consistently blew away his competition in the spring prep races. \"It's become like a fairy tale come true,\" said Coburn, who turns 61 today. \"It really, really has. It's quite an amazing deal .\" Some top trainers will admit they'd never feel complete without a Derby win. But Sherman, 77, isn't among them. All week, he's laughed with well-wishers, telling them how fortunate he feels for this late-career gift. Given his short, sturdy build, it's not hard to picture Sherman as the jockey he was for 23 years. \"I'm very satisfied with my career,\" he said. \"I never made it to what you'd say are the big, big horses, but I won a lot of graded stakes, always won my share and had a lot of fun .\" Sherman last came to Kentucky in 1955 as an 18-year-old working the barn for the great California horse Swaps. He had caught the racing bug a few years earlier, listening to the men call in bets from his father's barber shop. \"Everything was overwhelming to me,\" he recalled. \"I'd never been out of California. We took the horse off the van into the barn area and I'm seeing all the people around ....It was an awesome experience .\" He watched Swaps charge to victory from a perch on the backside, never making it to the winner's circle. Sherman became a jockey, always successful but a bit under the national radar. He repeated the pattern as a trainer, accumulating more than 2,000 wins from his California stable but never producing a Triple Crown star. He won't lie to you and say he knew California Chrome was the one. But he liked the chestnut colt from early on, finding him both amiable and quick to learn. \"He was just a baby, and yet he was more focused than a lot of the 2-year-olds,\" Sherman said. Coburn had seen the same qualities from the time Love the Chase gave birth. He and <mark>Martin</mark> had paid a $2,000 stud fee to pair her with a stallion named Lucky Pulpit. It seemed a humble blend on the surface, but the men based their hopes on the great horses - Swaps, Seattle Slew, Secretariat - in California Chrome's more distant ancestry. Coburn, who makes his living manufacturing the magnetic strips on credit cards, calls the Derby favorite \"Junior .\" \"He was just very curious,\" Coburn recalled. \"I'd walk up and I'd pet him. I've been feeding him the Mrs. Pastures horse cookies since he was 3-months old. So we've been interacting since he was a baby .\" He and <mark>Martin</mark> gave the horse to Sherman because they wanted an old-school trainer who would give California Chrome plenty of individual attention. California Chrome's poise has been on display all week at Churchill Downs. He likes to stop for a moment and take in the scene, apparently unperturbed by the photographers and patrons clicking cameras all around him. \"It's like I've been saying, he's almost half-human,\" said his exercise rider, Willy Delgado. \"He just likes to take it all in .\" Though California Chrome had his ups and downs as a 2-year-old, he has passed every test this year. Facing a stacked field at the Santa Anita Derby on April 5, he exploded to a 5-length victory that stamped him as the horse to beat in Kentucky. Sherman said jockey Victor Espinoza even eased up on the horse late in the race. The trainer had never seen one of his horses deliver quite like that. \"Every time I watch him run, especially that last time, I say wow,\" he said. \"He deserves to be the favorite,\" said Kentucky trainer Mike Maker, who will saddle three horses in the Derby. \"What does he do so well? He likes to win .\" With California Chrome's success came those big purchase offers, one as high as $6 million, according to Coburn, who added that someone even offered $2 million for Love the Chase. But Coburn and <mark>Martin</mark> weren't about to bow out before the Triple Crown. They wanted to live the dream and give Sherman a chance to complete his 59-year Kentucky circle. After a week at the center of the racing world's attention, the trainer said he was still having fun Friday morning. It was 8 a.m. outside Barn 20, and California Chrome had jogged early, keeping to his routine. Sherman had been up since 2 a.m., perhaps because of all the chocolate ice cream he'd eaten the night before. He had also visited Swaps' grave behind the Kentucky Derby Museum. \"That was touching for me,\" he said. Nearby, Coburn held court in his worn boots and weather-beaten cowboy hat. He said he had a $300 Stetson in a box at home that Sherman wouldn't let him wear for reasons of superstition. More than 60 years around the business have taught Sherman the enormous role luck plays for any horse, much less a Kentucky Derby champion. Just 24 hours earlier, Hoppertunity, the second choice on the morning line, had scratched because of a foot bruise. Sherman shook his head sadly at the thought. He could see California Chrome's perfect trip in his mind's eye - no trouble around the first turn, hang a few horses back from the lead, outlast the early speed and stay ahead of the late chargers. But who knew if reality would be so kind? \"Life plays a funny part in a lot of things,\" Sherman said. \"Maybe it's my turn .\" TONIGHT WHAT: 140th Kentucky Derby POST TIME: 6:32 WHERE: Churchill Downs, Louisville, Ky..

The effort, spearheaded by Massachusetts Senator Edward J. Markey, was also backed by Senators Sherrod Brown, Barbara Boxer, Jeff Merkley, <mark>Jack Reed</mark>, Richard Blumenthal, Tom Harkin and Dick Durbin. The two studies the group of senators highlight describe the many harmful chemicals which may be released in the vapor of e-cigarettes, including formaldehyde and other potential carcinogens. The studies dispel the idea that e-cigarettes contain less toxins than regular cigarettes, as a myth. The letter urges the FDA to recognize the potential impact e-cigarettes may have on the health of users and secondhand inhalers. It also asks the agency to consider the findings of the studies when \"These products put at risk not only adults and youth who use these devices, but potentially also those who are involuntarily exposed to secondhand vapors,\" write the Senators in the letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg. Concerns Over E-Cigarette Use By Youths The FDA recently announced its plan to begin regulating e-cigarettes, after continued indecision concerning oversight of the products by the agency. However, under the new enforcement move the FDA said it will not ban the use of flavors in the products, a highly controversial decision. Critics say the wide array of flavors is one ploy used by e-cigarette companies to attract teen users. The range of teen friendly flavors, including cotton candy, bubble gum, peanut butter and jelly and hundreds more, has spurred the use of e-cigarettes to doubled among high school students in only one year. congressional report revealed e-cigarette makers are targeting teens with candy-like flavors and marketing campaigns using celebrities, in an effort to drive sales. The report asserts is the aggressive campaigns are creating a new class of users who will be more likely to become addicted to traditional cigarettes. \"Makers of these products have taken advantage of a regulatory black hole by marketing these new nicotine delivery products directly to youth,\" said the statement. Currently, the limitations on smoking in public spaces does not apply universally to all e-cigarette products, including hookah pens, liquid nicotine products and e-liquids. The senators hope to spur the FDA into creating regulations which will govern the use of these products in public areas, hopefully protecting the public from harmful side effects. A recent report released by the New York Times found heating the liquid used in e-cigarettes at high temperatures can produce vapors which carry dangerous toxins. Some users have also taken to a new process called \"dripping,\" where users apply nicotine liquid directly to the heating element on the device. This intensely and rapidly heats the liquid, offering the user a nicotine rush. In the process, causing a chemical reaction which creates carcinogens similar to those present in traditional cigarettes. \"We simply cannot afford to lag behind in our complete understanding of the health consequences to the user and bystander of these and other advanced nicotine delivery products,\" wrote Markey.

Your weather is set to CLEVELAND, Ohio--The carousel has landed. hand-crafted wonder that the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has awaited for more than a year is here. It is expected to open by the end of the month. Carousel Works began installing the animals Friiday - 64 in all. The company made eight that have never been produced for another zoo, including a fossa, emperor penguin, cardinal tetra fish, ocelot and ring-tailed lemur. <mark>Dan Jones</mark>, co-founder of the company, said the zoo insisted that no animal could have a traditional saddle. \"But people still need a place to sit,\" he said, and Carousel Works artisans had to come up with comfortable forms. Thus, a seahorse sports a sea shell on its back. Each animal starts as blocks of basswood, that are shaped on a machine similar to the devices that duplicate car keys. They are hand carved, hand sanded, primed, painted and varnished. Each of those processes takes place in different parts of the Mansfield factory. <mark>Jones</mark> said each figure takes up to a month, but there are enough in the production pipeline that five to seven are ready to go each week. first quarter of 2013. It is 54 feet in diameter, with 16 rows containing four animals apiece. There are also two ADA-accessible chariots. <mark>Jones</mark> said the company made one for the Bronx Zoo and all of the critters were bugs. It had 18 rows of animals. When a rival zoo ordered one, he said, they demanded more than the Bronx Zoo. On Friday, as the Mansfield team worked inside the carousel's shelter, other crews were outside completing the new Nature Discovery Ridge play area. The zoo describes it as an area designed \"to engage children's imaginations and inspire them to come out and play through the use of wild habitats and natural elements like rocks, water and trees .\" Christine Korhnak of the zoo's education division described it with elegant simplicity: \"It's the best backyard ever .\" As she spoke, Rick Pratt of Around the Bend Furniture was assembling a tent-like structure out of small logs. Pratt's specialty is making furniture our of willow branches and trunks. There are several structures in the play area that he has woven out of willow, including a conical thing somewhat like a teepee. No Reservation?

Friday Night SmackDown hit the SyFy airwaves last night (May 9, 2014) from Buffalo, New York, with a taped show featuring continued fallout from Extreme Rules this past Sunday night in New Jersey as well as initial hype to the upcoming here for full results and the live blog from the show if you missed it. Let's get to reacting to the show. We fight on Friday night! Sometimes pro wrestling doesn't need angles to be fun. Sometimes the story doesn't even really matter and you get swept up in a match between two guys you didn't expect to sweep you up and you end up entertaining. Not that you weren't expecting it or anything, but did the idea of a Sheamus vs. Dean Ambrose program make anyone light up with glee? No; no it didn't. It's clear now, however, that it should have. William Regal once said of Ambrose \"he is everyone's best opponent for the next 10 years\" and this match may have proved our favorite Man's Man correct. Sheamus is in the process of becoming a heel WWE hopes will compete with Randy Orton at the top to carry the summer. I'm not sure how he'll do it with the U.S. title weighing him down, but perhaps a unification program with Bad News Barrett can help catapult him there. Either way, this was just a fun match that featured zero interference and a clean ending. Ambrose put up a hell of a fight against a guy you can call a HOSS, needing two Brogue Kicks to put him away, and this felt like a meaningful title match on what appeared to be a meaningless episode of SmackDown. More of this, please. Segment grade: A - __________________________________ Strength beyond strength At some point in the past eight months or so, <mark>Mark Henry</mark> became the really big guy slightly less bigger guys toss around so they can look impressive. And while I mourn for the loss of the Hall of Pain, seemingly forevermore, I celebrate the fact that hot young acts like Roman Reigns can be made to look like hot young stars. I mean look at that Samoan drop. That is one strong man relocating about 450 L-B-S (what up). This match also highlighted an attribute we've been needing to see from Reigns but weren't sure he would possess: his ability to sell injury to the point that he's vulnerable but not so much that he ever looks weak because of it. That's an incredibly difficult balancing act, but as you can see in the video above, he's already shockingly proficient at it. There are very big things in store for this man, beyond matches against big men like <mark>Henry</mark>. He is the push that makes you move On Cageside Live reviewing Raw this week, I boldly proclaimed Seth Rollins to be the next Shawn Michaels. Watching this match only solidified that viewpoint. Seriously, watch this match and pay close attention to everything Rollins does. Like Michaels, he's always in the right position. Like Michaels, his timing is impeccable. Like Michaels, his movement is flawless. And, like Michaels, he can be in the ring with a guy like Batista as the smaller man but never make you feel like he shouldn't be there. He's always believable and because of that, he'll always be credible. He'll need booking help later when he's on his own but tell me you wouldn't want to work a feud with that guy. He bumps like crazy, he's business, and, what's more, he elevates. How much better did Batista look in this match than he has since coming back? Who else has been able to make Batista look this good? Daniel Bryan, and that's the end of the list. Until last night when Seth Rollins actually made it one. All the best to all the rest: I think we may fast be approaching a point where Rusev isn't winning squash matches over jobbers but committing hate crimes against black wrestlers. We'll know if that's a joke or not if WWE trots JTG out as the next victim. Bray Wyatt's promos have started making a lot more sense and thankfully someone told the creative team that it's better to get to the point quickly because it doesn't matter how smooth your tongue is, if you're rambling on for 30 minutes, I'm checking out at 10. The beauty of pro wrestling is in the details. When Luke Harper tagged in to the main event match to stand opposite John Cena, he stopped with a crooked grin and leaned down next to Bray Wyatt to get some tactical advice on how to handle the situation. I surely liked this more than you, but it adds a wrinkle to the otherwise boring \"overwhelming monster charges Cena and gets overwhelmed himself\" booking. Here's my hope for future booking with Cesaro: He realizes that Paul Heyman is in this for himself and he needed a way to stay on television to continue harping on about <mark>Brock Lesnar</mark> breaking Undertaker's streak at WrestleMania. This is also why he's stuck in a mid-card program with the likes of <mark>Rob Van Dam</mark>, and he turns on Heyman just in time for <mark>Lesnar</mark> to come back to set up a match between the two at SummerSlam. Because wouldn't Cesaro vs. <mark>Lesnar</mark> be the best damn match at this point? And wouldn't that we a great explanation for how awful Cesaro has been booked since winning the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal and aligning with Heyman? And wouldn't it be a great way to re-introduce <mark>Lesnar</mark> leading to a match that would undoubtedly rule? The sooner Bad News Barrett moves away from Big E the better. As mentioned previously, let's hope for a Barrett-Sheamus program on the European tour where they unify the titles. Say, that's a good match for Payback. Why were Emma and Santino Marella so shocked and appalled at Fandango and Layla kissing? If I have to watch even one more Los Matadores vs. 3MB match I might just complain even more on the Internet. This was a pretty damn good episode of SmackDown. Overall grade: B That's it from me, Cagesiders.
