Arlington County, Va., wants more female firefighters. The fire department there has even set up a camp to inspire potential recruits. Donning helmets and matching camp shirts, teenage girls line up to watch a demonstration: A model room with furniture is ablaze. Camper Tara Crosey says she came to camp in part because she \"wanted to show that girls are as strong as boys and girls can do what boys can do.\" The glass ceiling in this department was broken by Judy Brewer in 1974, when she became the nation's first female career firefighter. She paved the way, but the road to a career as a firefighter is still obscured for many women. That's what Arlington County firefighter Clare Burley is hoping to change with this camp, which started last year. She and her colleagues wanted to give girls an introduction to this potential career path. \"Little boys always hear about it - they get little fire trucks as toys - and girls never really get that kind of introduction,\" she tells <mark>Rachel Martin</mark>, host of Weekend Edition Sunday. \"So we wanted to get them thinking about it, come play with us, you know, see what we do, see how many female firefighters are here.\" Compelled To Help When Judy Brewer decided to become a firefighter in the '70s, there weren't other women to look to. But she was helping her then-husband study for his fire science degree, and (Warning: Images in the publication may be disturbing for some viewers .) \"I had read a publication called America Burning, and was really struck by the pictures of the absence of children, say, in a crib,\" she tells Weekend Edition. \"They would also have pictures of children that were hiding in a closet or under a bed or next to a bureau because they didn't know what to do and they couldn't get out.\" So she thought, \"I'd really like to be able to do something to at least save somebody.\" Support for Brewer's decision came from her family, particularly her four sisters. But not everyone was in favor of the career move. \"When I applied at my local fire station to volunteer in Fairfax County, I was told essentially to go back to my kitchen, it was no place for a woman,\" she says. Fellow churchgoers asked how she could \"lower\" herself to do that kind of job. Brewer's fellow firefighters weren't accepting, either. \"When I first was hired, people were worried about different things,\" she says. \"The one that they used as a reason was that they were afraid that I would compromise them in a fire by not being able to help them if they got into trouble.\" She had no doubts about her own abilities, though, and just maintained her physical shape - and stood her ground - until they decided to let it go. Brewer says it took nearly two years for her to feel accepted as part of the team. Over the years, Brewer did save \"many, many, many people.\" But, she says, \"The ones that stick with me are the ones that I couldn't save.\" There weren't always support services for firefighters, and some incidents affected her more than she realized at the time. Ultimately, however, she says she had to put the losses behind her. \"And you just keep saying, OK, I'm doing a lot of good. And you just keep moving forward,\" she says. Brewer served the Arlington County Fire Department from 1974 to 1999. When she retired, she was the first female battalion chief in the country. Doing More Fast-forward to the current team of Arlington County firefighters, and you'll find not one but 22 women. That's out of more than 300 firefighters. Firefighter Burley says that's pretty good, compared to the rest of the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2012, women made up 3.4 percent of the nation's firefighters. \"But it's still a pretty small proportion. And it seems like the newest recruit classes are actually getting fewer women, not more,\" she says. \"So we feel like we need to do something more, get out in the community, and talk to girls a little bit more about choosing the fire service as a career.\" "}, {"articleID": "2018110623_00220012_W", "names": {"Steve Ball": ["Q16836483", "Q7611857"]}, "date": "2018-11-06", "url": "http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsliverpool/47-year-old-man-died-after-horrific-frenzied-attack-inside-kirkby-flats/ar-BBPpuOS?srcref=rss", "content": "\u00a9 LIVERPOOL ECHO A murder investigation has been launched after a man was attacked inside a flat on Kelday Close in Kirkby A 47-year-old man died in hospital after an horrific \"frenzied attack' inside a block of flats, neighbours said.

to scores released this week, with the recovery school district schools in new orleans posting the largest gains. rusty costanza, the times-picayune archive students at william fischer charter school in algiers participate in a leap test rally in april. that's strong evidence that the transformation of the city's public schools after hurricane katrina continues to yield results. education officials at the state and local level need to continue pushing in that direction and fend off efforts to erode reforms. students across most of our area showed progress, although large discrepancies exist between districts. the top average performance came from students in the 16 schools that remain under the orleans parish school board. that's hardly surprising, as the board in 2005 kept only schools that were not failing before the storm and several of those campuses are magnet schools with admissions requirements. overall, schools in st. tammany, plaquemines, st. bernard and st. charles parishes continued to perform near or above the state averages in most results of the state leap, ileap and graduate exit exams administered this spring. some parishes were significantly better than the state's figure. but not all students saw gains from last year. st. tammany has performed well above the state's average for several years and saw gains in all areas, except the graduate exit exam taken by students in 10th and 11th grades. those results actually dipped a bit from last spring, and officials need to focus on maintaining gains and improving performance across the board. state officials highlighted the gains recorded in st. bernard in recent years. since 2007, the percentage of st. bernard students scoring at \"basic\" proficiency--essentially at grade level--or above has risen 17 percent. that's an impressive gain. but the largest gains overall came among the new orleans schools the state took over after katrina because of their historic poor performance. most of those schools are now independent charters overseen by the rsd, which also runs a number of traditional schools. rsd students, including charter and traditional campuses, posted their fourth-consecutive year of improvement, increasing the proportion of students scoring at grade level or above to 48 percent. that's a 5 percent gain compared to 2010. with that progress, the proportion of rsd students scoring at grade level or better has more than doubled since 2007, from 23 percent to 48 percent. the numbers reflect the progress sparked by the wholesale reform of the system after katrina. the district still has substantial ground to cover to raise its overall performance to the state average. but the progress since katrina would have been unthinkable without the reforms. the track record of the system in recent years--including these latest scores--should stymie efforts by some teacher unions and other critics of charter schools to erode reforms the rsd is not perfect, and it needs to address inequities between individual schools. the system also needs to focus on improving performance among new orleans schools that are still well below the state average. that's particularly true for high schools still run directly by the rsd. rsd superintendent <mark>john white</mark> said the results show the district is a national model for broader education reform efforts. \"the new orleans system of schools works. period. end of story. and we cannot go back to a system that does not put children's needs first.\" he said. \"these results should close the book on that question.\" mr. <mark>white</mark> is right. new orleans' results also show that officials in jefferson parish must accelerate their push for reform. jefferson schools, which now rank 52nd out of 70 public school systems in louisiana, posted gains in five of seven grade levels that take the standardized tests. but jefferson still remained well below the state's average and also had a dismaying 21 percent drop from last year's scores in the gee. that's unacceptable for one of the largest and richest public school systems in the state. \"we cannot be complacent, satisfied or celebratory,\" deputy superintendent <mark>richard carpenter</mark> said of the results. indeed. the message jefferson officials should draw from these results is that they should pursue reform as vigorously as their rsd counterparts have done in new orleans. and even the school systems with the best scores in the region need to continue working to improve."}, {"articleID":

Related Slideshow: 7 Strategies for Rhode Island Economic Development in 2014 What will it take to move the Rhode Island economy forward in 2014? GoLocal talked with elected officials, candidates, and leaders for their economic development plans in the coming year. Below are key elements of the economic priorities for Governor Lincoln Chafee, Speaker of the House Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, House Minority Leader Brian Newberry, gubernatorial hopefuls General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and <mark>Ken Block</mark>, and RI Center for Freedom and Prosperity's Mike Stenhouse. Governor Lincoln Chafee \"My goal is to have the state continue to focus on the fundamentals. We will invest in education, workforce development and infrastructure, and provide aid to cities and towns to lessen the burden on property taxpayers. I'm confident that these investments and our focus on the basics will allow Rhode Island to exceed Moody's predictions.\" Speaker Gordon Fox \"Among the many pieces of legislation the House will address will be issues of higher education affordability, expanding apprenticeship opportunities, and offering help to our manufacturers. We will also look closely at our tax structure to make sure we are competitive with our neighboring states, including the corporate tax and the estate tax, and I will carefully review the recommendations of the commission studying our sales tax.\" Senate Pres. Paiva-Weed Greg Pare, spokesperson for the Senate President, said that the Senate is planning to issue recommendations soon on workforce development initiatives to address the skills gap among Rhode Island job seekers. \"An example of a proposal anticipated in that report is the elimination of state's Indirect Cost Recovery on the Job Development Fund, which is about $1.2 million this year. Those funds would be directed towards job training and skills development programs to provide immediate impact and help workers gain the skills necessary to succeed in today's economy.\" Gen. Treasurer Raimondo \"To grow our economy, we need to make Rhode Island a leader in manufacturing again. Great things can happen at the intersection of government, higher education, and the private sector. Rhode Island is lucky to have thriving institutions in each of these three sectors, and we need to foster collaboration among them to find solutions to our challenges, and spark our economy. By promoting partnerships in high-growth areas, [Rhode Island Innovation Institute] will help grow our manufacturing base, and create new, high-quality jobs.\" <mark>Ken Block</mark> \"First, we need to fix Rhode Island's broken Unemployment Insurance program. The state's Unemployment Insurance tax, paid by employers, is ranked worst in the country by the Tax Foundation. It is one of the factors that makes Rhode Island an uncompetitive place to do business. Also, it is inherently unfair that a large group of businesses are effectively subsidizing the payrolls of a small group of businesses who misuse the system. There is a simple change to state law that can fix this problem.\" \"Rhode Island's temporary disability tax (TDI) is broken, and places an unnecessarily high tax burden on Rhode Islanders. This tax, paid for by employees, will be reduced by changing the way we manage the program. As Governor, I will substantially reduce the cost of purchasing this insurance by requiring that Rhode Island's program adhere to national norms.\" \"To best encourage new job creation, I propose the following tax incentive: exempt from future capital gains taxes any new investments in Rhode Island-based businesses.

first impressions of the new star wars game (360) did you know that the name of darth vader's secret apprentice in star wars: the force unleashed - \"starkiller\" - was the original surname of luke skywalker in early drafts of the original star wars screenplay? or that babylon 5 showrunner j michael straczynski paid homage to this fact by giving his own lead character, <mark>john sheridan</mark>, the starkiller moniker as his nickname among the mysterious minbari? no? then be assured that i've now outlined my sci-fi geek credentials. you're in safe hands here. i've always ignored the litany of star wars expanded universe material. my view is that if a plot isn't canon, then balls to it. therefore the lucas-approved storyline in force unleashed, which fills in the squiggly bits between episodes iii and iv of the star wars saga, is the first major draw outside the movies for me personally, for years. just how did we get from the jedi being wiped out, to the fledgling rebel alliance? and what does the apprentice - who seemingly exists solely to do darth vader's duplicitously dirty, off-the-books bidding, rather than shouting \"that's what i'm talking abaaaaat!\" every five seconds - have to do with it all? the early story cutscenes are promising. the apprentice himself is surprisingly likeable and sympathetic rather than brimming with the expected genero-teen-angst evil, and an engaging droid character called proxy provides the funnies while having more than a little bit of sinister bite behind him. he doesn't even come across as an hk-47 rip-off, which is refreshing. the only downsides are darth vader's \"it's not really him, is it? why didn't you get <mark>james earl jones</mark>, you idiots?\" voice and subtly misjudged line-readings, which make you root for man-in-the-suit <mark>david prowse</mark> to finally be given the chance to utilise his \"the farrrrce is strang wiv you, moi luvver\" vocal talents. the first test, however, is easily passed. since the story isn't rubbish, force unleashed is automatically better than 99% of narrative-based games. but the other story here - the gameplay itself - is more troublesome, and force unleashed has many of the same problems that crop up again and again in third person action adventures. the major issue is the automatic targeting system, which is, frankly, broken. it selects your target very vaguely based on the direction in which you're facing, but there badly needs to be an option to switch manually, as in the middle of a fight against multiple enemies, with multiple targetable objects also around you, it's almost impossible to force grip the exact stormtrooper you really want to fling about. this leads to the game becoming rather more of a button-masher than it should be. with the targeting woes hampering efforts at precision, the best strategy is to hammer the lightsabre and various force buttons willy-nilly in order to rid the screen of all opposition. the euphoria engine (formerly seen in grand theft auto iv) proves itself to be the ideal technical gubbins to depict chaotic uses of the force here, with the requisite force grip and force push abilities all present, spangly and correct. the action often looks spectacular onscreen, with enemies flying through the air in multiple directions, and electronics being ripped out of their housings to explode all over the place, but when the button-mashing is compounded by the dreaded qte sequences that pop up when defeating some of the larger enemies and in boss battles, it often feels that you're not in complete control of the action. your inability to move while using the force, and the swiftly dwindling energy bar for use of the ability (presumably both present for difficulty balancing purposes), are the final nails in the coffin. having seen jedis fight in the movies, the force unleashed's control problems and restrictions make the combat more old man guinness than young pretender mcgregor. the game isn't helped by the level paths' extreme linearity either, which almost jedi mind tricked me into thinking that n + is a free-roaming extravaganza. still, the art design is absolutely lovely, the music recognisably star wars, and general presentation - apart from the screen tearing and some clunky loading times - is everything you'd expect from a big budget game. certainly the compulsion to get to the next slice of the plot will overcome many of the gameplay problems for star wars fans. however, for anyone who has no interest in the story and has been fooled by the hype into expecting combat on the level of a ninja gaiden or devil may cry, this probably isn't the game you're looking for. darth vader, everyone's favourite intergalactic sir alan sugar, certainly shouldn't fire his apprentice at this point, but neither should he rush to hire him quite yet."}, {"articleID": "2019100410_00108479_W", "names": {"Tim Cook": ["Q1404825", "Q265852", "Q7803347", "Q7803348"]}, "date": "2019-10-04", "url": "https://www.forexcrunch.com/bitgo-customers-can-earn-13-per-annum-on-staking/", "content": "BitGo customers can earn 13% per annum on staking You are at: Home \"Crypto News\" BitGo customers can earn 13% per annum on staking BitGo customers can earn 13% per annum on staking Oct 4, 2019 10:07 GMT | Last Modified: At the initial stage, staking rewards for Dash and Algorand are available.

The deal gives U.S. livestock producers new market access and simplifies inspection rules for fruits and vegetables while lowering taxes across farm goods, according to Darci Vetter, the U.S. Trade Representative's chief agriculture negotiator. While not reaching the ideals hoped for by domestic commodity groups, American agriculture benefits more than enough to line up behind the deal, Vetter said. \"The whole point of trade is that not every country's responsibilities are the same. Not everyone is focused on the same products,\" Vetter said in an interview before the final deal was announced. \"We have some wins in here.\" Negotiators in Atlanta wrapped up final agreements on agriculture, autos, drug patents and other thorny issues that have held up the TPP, a top priority of U.S. President Barack Obama. The deal includes nations that compose 40 percent of the world economy and create a regional trade bloc countering China's growing influence in Asia. U.S. farm exports topped $150 billion in 2014 and account for more than one-fifth of the country's agriculture production, according to government data. TPP will boost sales by \"billions,\" Vetter said, declining to make a specific estimate. Rice, sugar Tariffs and other barriers to farm goods, including rice, sugar and dairy, were among the final snarls that caused earlier talks in Hawaii to break off in July. U.S. negotiators touted agricultural opportunities they're gaining in growing Asian markets, where reductions in tariffs on U.S. goods would make products more competitive with Australia, New Zealand and other competitors, Vetter said. \"Our meat industry is a big winner,\" Vetter said, with pork duties going away in Vietnam and Japan capping tariffs on the meat at 50 yen per kilogram and making it easier for U.S. shippers such as Tyson Foods Inc. to target specific meat cuts for the Japanese markets. Pork was one of Japan's top-priority agricultural commodities heading into the TPP, along with beef, dairy, sugar, rice and other grains. On rice, Japan is establishing a new quota of 50,000 tons of U.S. imports, which will rise to 70,000 over 13 years, along with potential new opportunities for increased U.S. sales within quotas already created through the World Trade Organization. Less than hoped The quota was less than that hoped for by rice exporters in the U.S., the fifth-leading shipper of the grain after Thailand, India, Vietnam and Pakistan. Japan, where the grain has been culturally and economically important for millennia, imports almost none of its supply, thanks to high tariffs supported by JA-Zenchu, the nation's union of farmer cooperatives. While not as important culturally as rice to Japan, U.S. sugar access was another obstacle, with Australia wanting the U.S. to loosen a quota system that protects its own industry and protections that date to the Great Depression. Under TPP, the U.S. is establishing a new quota for Australia, with an option to raise that allotment in years when the domestic import need is greater, Vetter said. \"We're providing Australia with the same upfront quota as other nations,\" Vetter said. Dairy fight Dairy was the last major area to be resolved. Exporters Australia and New Zealand had called for greater access to the U.S. market, though the biggest criticisms were reserved for Canada, where a system of tariffs and supply management has insulated the country's 12,000 dairy farmers from the rest of the world. Dairy has emerged as an emotional issue in Canada's nationwide elections to be held later this month. Tractors converged on Ottawa, the nation's capital, earlier this week as farmers pressured the government to reject any TPP agreement. One of the final pieces of the deal to come together involved Canada's unique protections against imported dairy goods. In the end, Canada agreed to open--over five years--foreign quotas for 3.3 percent of its dairy market, 2.3 percent of its egg market, 2.1 percent of its chicken market, 2 percent of its turkey market and 1.5 percent of its broiler hatching eggs market. \"We obviously would have preferred that no additional market access be conceded in the dairy sector,\" Dairy Farmers of Canada President <mark>Wally Smith</mark> said in an e-mail. \"However, we recognize that our government fought hard against other countries' demands, and have lessened the burden by announcing mitigation measures and what seems to be a fair compensation package.\" To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Bjerga in Washington at abjergabloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97bloomberg. net Elizabeth Wasserman"}, {"articleID": "2014061620_00008254_W", "names": {"Roy Moore": ["Q17466511", "Q27924997", "Q5302905"], "John Roberts": ["Q11153", "Q14949621", "Q16196671", "Q19325651", "Q20895752", "Q21542199", "Q2913257", "Q320178", "Q41805076", "Q44155502", "Q47430963", "Q54610143", "Q56187938", "Q56253587", "Q56597924", "Q6255164", "Q6255170", "Q6255174", "Q6255177", "Q6255184", "Q6255195", "Q6255202"]}, "date": "2014-06-16", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/06/16/3449221/it-took-until-last-friday-for-an-alabama-court-to-strike-down-that-states-ban-on-gay-sex/", "content": "A law is still on the books in the state of Alabama which provides that a person is guilty of \"sexual misconduct\" if they engage in \"[a] ny act of sexual gratification between persons not married to each other involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another\" - meaning that oral and anal sex of any kind is a crime under Alabama state law unless it is enjoyed with one's spouse. Because Alabama is also a marriage discrimination state, this law has obvious implications for gay people in that state. Indeed, the official commentary to the law explains that it was enacted to \"make all homosexual conduct criminal.\" \"Consent,\" under this Alabama sex ban, \"is no defense to a prosecution.\" handed down the state's first decision declaring this law unconstitutional. This isn't a particularly surprising decision. The Supreme Court held in its landmark 2003 opinion in Lawrence v. Texas that the Constitution forbids laws prohibiting consensual, private sexual activity between adults. If an Alabama court allowed the state's sex ban to stand, it would have done so in direct defiance of the Constitution and the Supreme Court of the United States. In fairness, the fact that it took nearly eleven years from the day Lawrence was decided for an Alabama court to strike down this law may be attributable to good behavior by the state's prosecutors (although that still Lawrence). Shortly after Lawrence, the state's attorney general conceded that the law is unconstitutional \"to the extent that it applies to private, legitimately consensual anal and oral sex between unmarried persons.\" So it is possible that the law has not been tested because prosecutors refrained from bringing unconstitutional prosecutions under this statute after Lawrence. Indeed, the defendant in the case that ultimately led the state appeals court to strike this law down was initially charged with \"sodomy in the first degree\" - a much more serious crime akin to rape. The jury, however, did not convict this defendant of a crime involving non-consensual sex. They convicted him of the lesser crime prohibiting consensual anal intercourse. This, the state appeals court held, is not allowed. Despite Lawrence, there is some risk that the state supreme court could try to reinstate the ban on oral and anal sex. The state's chief justice, <mark>Roy Moore</mark>, is compared a judge who struck down the military's anti-gay Don't Ask/Don' t Tell policy to al-Qaeda urging defiance of Supreme Court rulings. The bigger risk, however, will come if the United States Supreme Court adds just one more conservative justice. Although six justices agreed in Lawrence that the state of Texas' ban on gay sex was unconstitutional, one of those justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, has since left the Court. Moreover, four of the Court's current members, Chief Justice <mark>John Roberts</mark> and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, joined anti-gay opinions in the 2013 decision United States v. Windsor. If another conservative joins the Court, there may be enough votes to overrule U.S. Set To Execute First Inmate Since Bungled Oklahoma Execution"}]
