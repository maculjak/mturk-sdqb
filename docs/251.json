one of his clients to build a case to withhold public records sought by the dispatch. the newspaper's request for records surrounding american electric power's potential rate-hike settlement before the public utilities commission of ohio led the utilty and others to petition the puco to shield the records from release as trade secrets. however, dewine said yesterday that it appears the records must be released and that any move to deny the records would have to be justified by strong legal arguments that do not appear at hand. iran injected a new twist yesterday into the week-old u.s. accusation of an iranian plot to assassinate the saudi ambassador to washington, asserting that one of the defendants actually belongs to an outlawed and exiled opposition group. the defendant, gholam shakuri, identified by the justice department as an operative of the elite quds force of iran's revolutionary guards corps, is a \"key member\" of the muhajedeen-khalq, iran's mehr news agency reported. the agency did not explain the group's possible motive but implied that the plot was a bogus scheme meant to ostracize iran. it said shakuri, who is at large, was last seen in washington and in camp ashraf, the group's enclave in iraq. \"the person in question has been traveling to different countries under the names of ali shakuri/gholam shakuri/gholam-hussein shakuri by using fake passports including forged iranian passports,\" mehr said. u.s. officials did not comment on the mehr report. mark toner, a state department spokesman, reiterated the u.s. view in washington that \"this was a serious breach of international law and that iran needs to be held accountable.\" the opposition group itself dismissed the mehr report as nonsense. shahin gobadi, a spokesman, wrote in an email that \"this is a well-known tactic that has been used by the mullahs in the past 30 years where they blame their crimes on their opposition for double gains.\" the group, also known as the national council of resistance of iran, is regarded by iran as a violent insurgent organization with a history of assassinations and sabotage aimed at overthrowing the islamic government that took power in 1979. although the group says it renounced violence a decade ago, it is still classified as a foreign terrorist organization by the state department, but not by britain or the european union. it maintains a headquarters in paris. mehr said it had learned what it called the new information about shakuri from interpol but gave no details. calls and emailed queries to interpol were not immediately returned. if shakuri were a member of the opposition group, it would embarrass the united states, which announced the suspected plot with some fanfare a week ago. in a televised news conference, attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> said u.s. investigators thought that high-level officials in iran were responsible. the justice department has accused shakuri and mansour j. arbabsiar, a naturalized iranian-american citizen from corpus christi, texas, of conspiring to hire assassins from a mexican drug gang for $1.5 million. u.s. officials have acknowledged that the suspected plot sounds hard to believe but asserted they have the evidence to back it up. saudi arabia has accused iran of a \"dastardly\" scheme, and other u.s. allies say they take the accusation

The people of Gyodong Island have more in common with <mark>Kim Jong-un</mark>'s side of the border than their own - it's the \"North Korea of the South\" . The tiny South Korean isle, situated right on the border with North Korea, has barely any military presence and the people on each side wave happily to each other. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Residents don't need to set their alarm, as they've got a 7am wake up call from North Korea's propaganda radio. When the Korean War began in 1950, locals were told to swim down to the other side and \"in a few days\" , the island would be taken back by the North Koreans. It never happened, but the Gyodong residents, who speak with North Korean accents, have never forgotten which side they're on. No one is as close to the communist regime as they are. There's not millions of landmines, tanks and military, just a tiny sliver of the Yellow Sea and a fence. North Korean cheering squads arrive south, ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony. Photo / Ahn Young-joon-Pool, Getty Share on Reddit reddit Even the fence is fairly recent after so many people from the north were floating down to the south. It's that close, only 1.2 miles wide, that any potential North Korean defector was able to ride the tide down to the south's edge. A council official tells us \"at the right time and place, you can float your way here.\" Gyodong has been stuck in the past with propaganda posters lining the streets of the main town of Daeryong, and the retro market stalls are manned by first generation North Korean defectors, who are bitter sweet about the last sixty-odd years.

A bridge was built connecting the island to the Korean mainland in 2014 and people are fast hearing about the island's charm, it's now becoming popular with expats living in Seoul, three hours away by car. Park Jang Ja has loaded her shop with British and American clothes and bags, she says she \"loves the English\" and, as we speak, she's got her face glued to the screen as <mark>Donald Trump</mark> is making a speech and she's holding a pillow with a Union Jack. She's wearing Bean Pole clothing, a trendy South Korean store with a Penny Farthing as its label. The brand claims it wants to \"emphasise the British-like style that they aim for\" , signing Mark Ronson and Cara Delevingne as models. \"I've been here for about 45 years. I was here before the bridge, when people had to come here according to the ebbs and flows of the day,\" says Park. \"And now that there is a bridge, people can finally buy stuff in my store, we want more tourists, I love all the visitor's gear!\" My parents are first generation descendants of North Korea. Of course, I feel a part of them. \"Those people on the north, in the Spring, when we replant the rice in our paddy fields, they too are on their paddy fields. Before the fence was there, you could hear them talk.\" Now, every morning the North Koreans have broadcasts and you can hear it. I'm not scared. It's part of my life.

As people get older, they seem to miss their roots and value their heritage and lineage more. \"Some tourists even say that the people here speak with a North Korean accent. So in a figurative sense, we are very close with North Korea.\" The residents of this island have more in common and more interactions with their northern counterparts than South Koreans. In that sense, maybe the residents here feel a bond. \"Now <mark>Kim</mark> says that they want to open their doors to more international tourists like the Brits\" , adding: \"We are far out on the west, so development hasn't been so fast. However, what first was a flaw is now an idiosyncratic aspect of the island. Tourists have called the island\" the island that has been trapped in time. \"\"After the bridge was laid, there are many tourists coming, especially during the weekend, we are getting people who want to escape Seoul. Now we are one of Korea's\" Year of Tourism' areas, which has helped us get a head start in tourism. \"We are using this opportunity to increase tourism, but also increase awareness of our role in the unification and peace advocacy community.\" We have built a Peace Bicycle Trail all around the fence and an observatory, where people can see normal North Koreans on the fields, as opposed to the military images that they often see on the media. \"Every year, defectors in the island climb to the top of Manghyangdae Mount, at the northern end of Gyodong, which looks out onto the North Korean town of Yeonbaek, Hwanghae Province.

Game of Thrones' eighth season hasn't started yet, but showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss recently confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that at least one fan-favorite character won't make it out of the final season alive: Ser Pounce, Tommen Baratheon's pet cat, who was introduced back in season 4. According to Benioff, \"Cersei hated the name\" Ser Pounce' so much she could not allow him to survive. So she came up with her most diabolical [execution]. Ser Pounce's death was so horrible we couldn't even put it on the air. \"\u00a9 Shutterstock Kit Harington Ser Pounce's death may not come as much of a surprise, given that the cat only appeared in a single episode, back in season 4's\" Oathkeeper. \"Still, the recent reappearance of long-missing characters like Beric Dondarion and Gendry in season 7 left some fans hoping Ser Pounce might have a return in store, too, despite the death of his owner, Tommen Baratheon. Tommen committed suicide back in season 5, after his wife Margaery was killed in the explosion that destroyed the Great Sept of Baelor. Actor Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed Tommen, commented back in 2016 that he hoped Ser Pounce\" didn't get caught up in the blast, \"and that the cat would\" move on with his life and get a girlfriend maybe, \"in the wake of that tragedy. Alas, it seems such a return is not to be.\" That cat was really not fun to work with. \"Plot points aside, it's also possible that the two showrunners may have had other reasons for killing off the cat off-screen--simply, it seems that the cat that played Ser Pounce was kind of a diva.\" That cat was really not fun to work with, \"Benioff notes in the same interview.\" Dogs generally do what you ask them to do if they're smart and well trained, \"Weiss says.\" Cats have their own agenda. \"\u00a9 Shutterstock <mark>Sophie Turner</mark> Chapman's similarly said working with Ser Pounce was difficult, telling the Huffington Post that when filming the scene,\" That cat that day would have none of it. He was just loving life. He just really wasn't on his game that day. \"Chapman went on to speculate,\" I think that was the reason why they didn't have him back because it's just hard work. Cats can't understand English, so you tell a cat, \"Come on. Jump on the bed,' and he just looks at you like,\" What are you talking about? \"' And Natalie Dormer--who shared the scene with Ser Pounce and Chapman--also confirmed the issue in a 2014 Reddit AMA, commenting that\" Ser Pounce was a bit of a diva that day, he didn't want to stay on the bed, he was very difficult to work with. \"\u00a9 Shutterstock Kristofer Hivju It seems that inability to play well with others led to Ser Pounce ultimately being killed off-screen.

The team has been known to log in 14 hours in a single weekend building robots. Photo by Ana Sofia Amieva-Wang View All Photos (9) They wear purple capes. They decorate their gear with stick-on jewels, and carry a tote bag decorated with their team logo. They also program a robot to operate autonomously and with remote controls. And, in two years, they've gone from starting their own team to competing in the world championships at an activity known widely to be skewed male. They're Renegade Robotics, an all-girls robotics team made up of five high school students from Menlo Park and Portola Valley: Serena <mark>Peters</mark> (grade 9), Avani Anne (grade 10) and Navya Anne (grade 12) at Menlo-Atherton High School; Anna Beaver (grade 11) at Woodside High School; and <mark>Elizabeth Peters</mark> (grade 11) at Pinewood School. Coached by Leslie <mark>Peters</mark>, mother to <mark>Elizabeth</mark> and Serena, they compete in a league called VEX Robotics, run by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation. Unlike other leagues, where there is a set amount of time that teams are given to work on their robots, the VEX league allows teams to work on iterations of their robots over the course of a year, as they develop robots that can complete a set of challenges during two-minute, two-on-two competitions. Of about 11,000 teams in 32 countries, about 700 are all-female, a VEX Robotics spokesperson says. At the California state championships, the Renegade team members were almost the only girls competing among 36 teams, Coach <mark>Peters</mark> says. \"VEX Robotics has a particularly bad male-to-female ratio,\" she says. Renegade is one of only two all-girls teams in Silicon Valley--\"the other one is the one we left,\" she says. The girls split from the other team because they wanted to spend more time building robots, Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> says. Team members interviewed by the Almanac say they typically meet for three-hour sessions twice a week in a teammate's garage. They have been known to log as many as 14 hours in a single weekend, but they find the work rewarding. \"It's the best way to spend your free time,\" Anna says. <mark>Elizabeth</mark>, who does a lot of the programming to make the robot move autonomously, says she loves the feeling when the robot starts working. \"It's all this work, but then (it starts) and you're like,\" Whoa! We built this! It's doing things. It's doing really cool things!'...and you feel so proud that you made this thing that can move on its own. \"The competition At the annual world championships, the next year's\" game, \"or set of challenges that the robots will have to complete, is announced. Then the work begins back home. After an intensive study of the rules, there are discussions of strategy and how to best score points. Then comes designing, prototyping, testing and practice driving the robot. Unlike many of the boys' robots, which are driven usually by one student, the girls say, the Renegade team has multiple drivers operating different parts of the robot. This year, after competing in local tournaments and the state championships, the girls' robot didn't perform well enough to qualify for the world championships the traditional way, by beating the tournament bracket. Instead, they got into the competition with a wild-card spot given for winning a video competition. Their video was about how to use an LCD display to calibrate the robot. They say they were motivated to win the competition after receiving an honorable mention the previous year for their tongue-in-cheek video about how handy it is to have a\" magic \"tote bag to carry extra supplies. At the 2017 VEX Worlds, a world competition, held April 19 to 22 in Louisville, Kentucky, they saw all-girls teams from other countries, and placed higher than they expected to, with a 5-5 record. Unsurprisingly, the level of robotics competition in Silicon Valley more than holds its own compared to other regions.\" The problem with being from Silicon Valley is that this is where all the good teams are, \"Anna explained. China and Singapore are also known to be highly competitive, the girls say. Mentor of the year The team also submitted an essay to the organization nominating Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> for the Mentor of the Year award, which she won and was presented with at the world championships. Though she has a STEM background--she studied mathematics at Princeton and was an actuary before she had kids--Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> says.\" I had to learn all of this stuff really quickly so I get to be just a bit ahead of the girls. \"She now blogs about strategies and problem-solving for VEX teams. Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> and Serena have also helped to mentor an upcoming robotics team at the Corte Madera School in Portola Valley. According to principal Cyndi Maijala and Jason Borgen, the school's director of innovation and learning, parents of Renegade Robotics team members have been involved in helping to launch a competitive robotics program at the school, and the girls have helped to mentor the co-ed middle school team. Success\" I think their success is self-reinforcing, \"Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> says about the team.\" They put in a lot and they have a lot to show for it, and that makes them want to keep going. \"She points to a shelf in the garage lined with trophies:\" This is two seasons of five girls in a garage. \"Because each team must join with another team to face off against two others during the competitions, and are matched up randomly during the tournaments, Ms. <mark>Peters</mark> says, the team has had to learn how to negotiate with other teams to discuss strategy and have confidence in their robot's performance. As middle - and high-school female engineers, they say they sometimes come up with fixes that are different than what boys would do. Using hair ties to help hold pieces in place is an example, Anna said. They also decorate their robots with stick-on jewels and stickers, and have a tradition of naming each year's robot after a secondary Disney character.

He did not enter a plea and remained in custody. Police spokeswoman Lisa-Marie Brooks said a police dog unit apprehended <mark>Tully</mark>, 48, near a lake shortly after 5 p.m. following an extensive manhunt in the South Island town of Ashburton. She said <mark>Tully</mark> was being treated for minor dog-bite injuries and police were still searching for the weapon used in the shootings. Earlier, police had urged residents to remain inside their homes as they searched an area near the town's river and stormed a house that turned out to be empty. <mark>Tully</mark> had been interviewed in recent weeks by the local newspaper about his struggles finding somewhere to live and had also written to lawmakers. The incident began about 10 a.m. when police said a man entered a Work and Income New Zealand office and started shooting. A witness said the man was wearing a black balaclava and shot at two women, according to the Ashburton Guardian newspaper. Other witnesses told the paper the man was carrying a shotgun that may have been sawed down and fled on a bicycle. Ministry of Social Development Chief Executive <mark>Brendan Boyle</mark> said all three victims worked for the agency. \"We are all devastated by the deaths of two of our colleagues in the shocking attack,\" <mark>Boyle</mark> said in a statement, adding \"our thoughts and prayers\" are also with the third victim who was being treated at an area hospital. Lawmaker <mark>Winston Peters</mark> said in a statement that <mark>Tully</mark> had emailed his political party on Aug. 14 about the difficulty of finding a house to live in. \"We replied immediately and also followed up,\" <mark>Peters</mark> said. \"However, the emails kept bouncing back.\" <mark>Tully</mark> last month told the Ashburton Guardian that he had previously worked in Australian mines, had returned to his hometown and had ended up living in a tent after being unable to secure government-assisted accommodation. Ashburton Mayor Angus McKay said the town was very community-minded and the tragedy would affect many lives: \"It just hits home real hard,\" he said, according to The New Zealand Herald newspaper. click here to upgrade your browser in order to comment."}, {"articleID": "2020011711_00128902_W", "names": {"Andy Murray": ["Q10125", "Q526811"]}, "date": "2020-01-17", "url": "http://www.asianimage.co.uk/sport/national/18168239.andy-murray-comeback-claims-leading-hip-specialist/", "content": "Sport National Sport <mark>Andy Murray</mark> comeback could be over, claims leading hip specialist By Press Association 2019 <mark>Andy Murray</mark> has been told his comeback could be over if he fails to recover from his latest injury 0 comment <mark>Andy Murray</mark>'s comeback will effectively be over if he fails to recover from his latest injury setback, a leading hip specialist has warned. <mark>Murray</mark>, 32, who has not played since November, announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from two events next month with the pelvic problem which forced him out of the Australian Open. Giles Stafford, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who has closely monitored <mark>Murray</mark>'s return, told the PA news agency: \"If it doesn't get better then it might be the end of what <mark>Andy</mark> is hoping to achieve.

He might be able to play doubles but singles could be too much for him. So it is obviously a concern going forward. \"With regards as to how things develop, if the injury doesn't improve, or when he returns to playing and the problem comes back, then obviously he has to think about where he goes from there.\" It was first felt that <mark>Murray</mark>'s injury, which surfaced at November's Davis Cup finals, was only minor. But the three-time major winner sparked concern when he withdrew from the opening grand slam of the year before then revealing he would play no part in next month's tournaments in Montpellier and Rotterdam. <mark>Andy Murray</mark> has won three grand slams but his comeback is in doubt (Mike Egerton/PA) And Stafford believes the bone bruising is linked to <mark>Murray</mark>'s hip resurfacing surgery at the start of 2019. \"It is claimed that <mark>Andy</mark>'s hip implant has a better range of motion than a standard conventional replacement and it actually doesn't,\" said Stafford. \"One of the problems with it is that it has a reduced range of motion because you save the native neck of the femur just under the ball. That can dig into the prosthetic metal cup earlier than a normal hip replacement would.\" I am guessing the issue with <mark>Andy</mark> is that he is pushing a lot of force through the hip, and I imagine what is happening is that his native femoral neck is hitting up against the metal cup and causing a lot of bruising on the thigh bone. Sliding into the weekend like...\u26f8 #AMC pic.twitter.com/cOyC70POHd--<mark>Andy Murray</mark> (@ andy_murray) December 20, 2019 \"The problem is that over time the metal cup can carve a notch in the bone just under the ball, and if that carries on it can predispose the bone to breaking.\" If that is the case, he will have to change certain aspects of the way he moves, and getting down to the ball and things like that could become an issue. They are just waiting for the bruising to improve but that could take months. \"Speaking on Thursday, <mark>Murray</mark>, who won his first ATP title following hip surgery in Antwerp in October, said:\" The bone bruising is taking longer to heal than first thought, so I won't be playing in Montpellier or Rotterdam in February. \"I don't want to rush anything or put a timeline on my recovery. I'm going to listen to my body and step back on the court to compete when the time is right.\" 0 comment"}]
