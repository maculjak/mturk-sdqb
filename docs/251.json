Entering the fifth day of the league's free agency, here are the latest rumblings for the best unsigned talent on the open market. USA TODAY Sports G Martin Brodeur, New Jersey Devils The 42-year-old Brodeur has spent his entire NHL career, which began in 1991, with the Devils. But after leading them to three Stanley Cup Championships, their working relationship seems to be officially over. Brodeur had backed up Cory Schneider this past season, but instead of re-signing Brodeur this summer, New Jersey opted to sign Scott Clemmensen to fill the reserve role. The Devils aren't the only team to pass on the future Hall of Famer. Pierre LeBrun of ESPN reported that his representatives talked to the Tampa Bay Lightning and Pittsburgh Penguins. However, Pittsburgh decided to sign Thomas Greiss and Tampa Bay went for Evgeni Nabokov instead: Brodeur camp did talk to likes of TB and Pitt but obviously no deals there...Will be very patient...even if it takes all summer...July 2, 2014 Brodeur has struggled to find a home this offseason. But despite his age, he still has the ability to be a valuable contributor - and not just in the locker room. His 19 wins this season were 26th-best in the NHL, and his 2.51 goals against average and .901 save percentage are without a doubt still second-string worthy. Dan Rosen of NHL.com, the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs are the most likely landing spots for Brodeur. Of course, Joe McDonald of ESPN reported otherwise on the Boston front. Bruins have no interest in Marty Brodeur, according to a league source. July 2, 2014 That leaves Toronto as Brodeur's top option right now. Tom Gulitti of The Record reported that the Maple Leafs' president of hockey operations, <mark>Brendan Shanahan</mark>, said, \"Why wouldn't there be interest in him?\" this summer. USA TODAY Sports C/LW Steve Ott, St. Louis Blues The Minnesota Wild already made a major splash this offseason by signing one of the top free agents, Thomas Vanek, and they may not be finished recruiting. LeBrun reported that the Wild are interested in Ott (h/t Star Tribune), who scored 23 points last season playing for the Blues and Buffalo Sabres. <mark>Michael Russo</mark> of the Star Tribune believes Ott would fill a hole in Minnesota that doesn't show up on the stat sheet, though. The Wild does lack toughness in my opinion (especially defensively), and when I say toughness, I'm not necessarily talking fighting. I just mean physicality, clearing bodies from the net...and some scare factor. There are times <mark>Mikael Granlund</mark> and Jared Spurgeon have been targeted. Heck, Nik Backstrom's health really began to derail last season after Nazem Kadri ran him AFTER running <mark>Granlund</mark> in the same game. <mark>Russo</mark> reported that the Maple Leafs are interested in Ott as well. Bill Hoppe of the Times Herald also reported that - despite signing Brian Gionta, Cody McCormick, Andrej Meszaros and Matt Moulson on the first day of free agency - Buffalo general manager <mark>Tim Murray</mark> \"wouldn't rule out\" an Ott return. <mark>Tim Murray</mark> wouldn't rule out signing Steve Ott, talked to his agent last night. Yesterday's moves could make it less likely. USA TODAY Sports C Derek Roy, St. Louis Blues <mark>Josh</mark> Rimer of Sportsnet reported Roy is close to signing a new contract. UFA Derek Roy is close to signing. It's down to two teams. One in the east and one in west. July 4, 2014 Roy finished with 37 points last season, 28 of which were assists. The Nashville Predators are one of the main teams he's linked to. And <mark>Josh Cooper</mark> of The Tennessean is a fan for a variety of reasons, one of which is because he'd help the recently acquired <mark>James Neal</mark> - who the Penguins traded to Nashville. New acquisition <mark>James Neal</mark> needs someone who can simply feed him the puck. Roy is an excellent distributor. He has had over 40 assists four times in his career. All he'll have to do is feed <mark>Neal</mark> the puck--something he did playing with sniping winger Thomas Vanek in Buffalo. If Rimer's report holds true, <mark>Neal</mark> will find out if Roy will be playing alongside him soon.

The program is called Drive Less; Save More, and it promotes drivers to bike, walk, carpool, or take the bus. The Oregon Department of Transportation is piloting the program with help from the City of Corvallis and Cascades West Rideshare. The city is hosting several free events throughout the month in both English and Spanish. \"We're trying to encourage people to not drive alone,\" said <mark>Greg Wilson</mark>, Transportation Program Specialist with the City of Corvallis. \"To save energy, and to not pollute the environment by using a different transportation option. It's in everyone's best interest to save energy .\" The program is targeting South Corvallis because the Willamette River geographically isolates it from the rest of the city. <mark>Wilson</mark> says the program is informing residents about walking and biking paths in the area, as well as transit and ride share opportunities. On Tuesday from 7:30 - 8:00 p.m., the program is hosting a free bike repair class in English and Spanish at the Tunison Community Center. Child care and snacks will be provided. Residents can also get free bags with gear for biking and walking, including maps, water bottles, umbrellas, and bike lights. The city will also host a free ice cream walk later this month.
