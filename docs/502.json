There wasn't a ballet slipper or pointe shoe in sight. Even <mark>Lauren Anderson</mark>, one of the first African-American ballerinas to become a principal for a major dance company, rocked a patent stiletto. Her task, alongside fellow state treasure Lynn Wyatt, was to unveil this year's three remaining Texas Medal of Arts Awards honorees. The Texas Cultural Trust usually divulges its full roster all at once. Most times, the big reveal happens during a semiformal announcement party. But with bold-face recipients including Matthew McConaughey, Mark Seliger, <mark>Brandon Maxwell</mark> and Trenton Doyle Hancock headlining the 10th biennial list, the Austin-based nonprofit couldn't wait that long--or resist a little early name-dropping. Fellow Texans Stephen Harrigan, Elaine Molinar and Craig Dykers have also been tapped, as has Laredo's Vidal M. Trevino School of Communications and Fine Arts. On Thursday, Texas Cultural Trust's board members traveled from across the state to hear the final trio - Boz Scaggs, Stephen Harrigan and <mark>Jennifer Holliday</mark> - receive their due, bringing the total headcount to 11. Why the extended drumroll? \"We want to garner as much support and celebrate these legends for as long as possible,\" said Heidi Marquez Smith, Texas Cultural Trust's executive director who also feted the early press conference. She told onlookers from the blue-screened stage, \"For artists and those in creative fields, a Texas Medal of Arts Award is the highest honor in the land .\" Houston Ballet's executive director <mark>Jim Nelson</mark> also shared brief remarks. He observed how fitting it was for <mark>Anderson</mark>, who danced with the company from 1983 to 2006, to return for the occasion. Afterward, the crowd posed for photos with <mark>Anderson</mark> and Wyatt. The women, both TMAA winners in 2017, got along famously. \"Lynn, if I'm in the picture, you're in the picture,\" <mark>Anderson</mark> said, coaxing her ally to join her at center stage. It's good practice for the River Oaks cocktail party scheduled in their honor later that evening, and the main event, next month in Austin. Texas Cultural Trust's two-day celebration Feb. 26 - 27 promises quite the show - especially if it's announcement style is any indication.

(AP Photo/Boris Vergara) Numerous governments in the Western Hemisphere quickly recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president of his crisis-torn country Wednesday. The United States and all but one member of the Lima Group of regional nations threw their support behind Guaido after he declared himself interim president in a defiant speech before masses of anti-government demonstrators. The declaration by the Lima Group, which has been vocal in denouncing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was signed by Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. Mexico was the only member to not sign. The group said it supported the beginning of the process of a democratic transition in Venezuela following its constitution with aim of carrying out new elections as soon as possible. It also condemned acts of violence in Venezuela and made a call for peace. U.S. President Donald Trump called on Maduro to resign and said the U.S. would use the \"full weight\" of its economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuela's democracy. Venezuelans have been suffering from an economic and governance crisis that has led millions to flee hyperinflation and severe shortages of food and medicine. Paraguay was the first regional country to express support after Guaido took an oath before thousands of supporters. \"Count on us to embrace freedom and democracy again,\" Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez said on Twitter. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Latin America's largest nation also would support the 35-year-old lawmaker \"so that peace and democracy return to Venezuela .\" There was no immediate reaction from Cuba, which is the top regional ally of Maduro, nor from Nicaragua, which is also close to Maduro's socialist government. Maduro was sworn into a contested second term two weeks ago in a move condemned by dozens of nations. Guaido has said it is his right under Venezuela's constitution to take over the presidency until new elections can be called. But not everyone backed his bold move. Bolivian President Evo Morales condemned what he called an imperialist attack. \"Our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and Nicolas Maduro, in these decisive hours when the claws of imperialism are once again trying to deal a death blow on democracy and self-determination on the peoples of South America,\" Morales tweeted. \"We will not be the backyard of the U.S. again .\" A spokesman for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico continued to recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president. \"We maintain our position of neutrality in the Venezuelan conflict,\" <mark>Jesus Ramirez</mark> Cuevas told Mexico's Milenio news television channel. \"The Mexican government is analyzing the situation in Venezuela. Until now, there is no change in its diplomatic relations with that country nor with its government .\" Maduro responded to Guaido's move by cutting off diplomatic relations with the U.S., the largest importer of Venezuelan oil, and announced that American diplomats had 72 hours to leave his country. He also heaped much of the blame for developments on U.S. imperialism and Colombia's \"oligarchy .\" Colombian President Ivan Duque said his nation would accompany Guaido \"in this process of transition toward democracy so that the Venezuelan people can free themselves from the dictatorship .\" Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Associated Press.

Last week we saw plenty of great' fits, but Frank Ocean and his large green Celine bag were a particular show-stealer. Snapped outside Louis Vuitton, the sleek leather Phoebe Philo-designed tote contrasted against the singer's casual combo of bright orange puffer, jeans, and beanie. It showed how the attitude toward bags in menswear is changing. You don't have to look femme or overdressed to sport a sizable accessory traditionally associated with women's fashion. In recent years, bags for men have gone from something almost taboo to one of the hottest trends, and the biggest industry players are keen to jump on board. In Milan, Fendi presented men's versions of the label's signature Baguette and Peekaboo bags, and a collaboration with Japanese luggage expert PORTER. A hybrid of a side bag and handbag in red, blue, and champagne-colored nylon with a golden F clasp, the Baguette is certain to be a sought-after model. At <mark>Kim Jones</mark>' Dior in Paris, almost every outfit was complemented by a bag: the new cross-body men's version of Dior's Saddle bag in silky nylon; neck wallets and small hard-case tube-shaped bags; soft fur bags; and more understated messenger-style numbers with metal buckles by <mark>Matthew Williams</mark> of ALYX.

For Fall/Winter 2019, almost every major fashion house had an updated it-bag for men, but few had worked on theirs as thoroughly as Virgil Abloh. In less than a year at Louis Vuitton, he has given us numerous versions of the Keepall: glow-in-the-dark; iridescent; semi-transparent neon pink and yellow; soft gray, and oversized black monogram-embossed in puffer material. This season also also gave us medium and purse-like mini versions of Louis Vuitton's signature retro travel trunks. Historically, men and bags have had a complicated relationship. Google the two words together and you'll find anxiety-laden questions along the lines of \"Are man bags acceptable?\" \"Can a man carry a purse?\" \"How to wear a man bag?\" and \"What do you put in a man bag?\" In the past, the rigid idea of masculinity allowed a backpack, a briefcase, or ideally nothing at all, stuffing your essentials into one's pockets. In fact, the very term \"man bag\" is an awkward attempt at emasculation. Louis Vuitton 4 more Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Previous Next Attitudes started to shift a few years ago. That went hand in hand with the rise of streetwear and was influenced by street culture references and \u201990s fashion. First fanny packs and then side bags became a menswear staple. It was a no-brainer, a combination of simple utilitarian design and practicality. The overwhelming success of outdoor and skate brands' versions were perhaps a turning point--think Patagonia, The North Face, Supreme, and Palace. It proved that in the menswear and streetwear markets, a bag can be a token of hype and obsession as much as the Birkin bag was for the Sex and the City generation of women. The side bag trend is still going strong, with the likes of Gucci, A-COLD-WALL *, and Burberry continuing to expand the range. The popularity of side bags was followed by the growing influence of even more masculine workwear and military designs: chest rigs (pioneered by ALYX), harnesses, and belt bags. The designs often played with fetish elements and added a bit of structure to relaxed sportswear silhouettes. The shift we witnessed on this season's runways, however, is bigger. Previously, men's bags were worn mostly as yet another garment and left hands-free, but now we're talking handbags and shoulder bags, styled and worn exactly as women do. As seen with Ocean's Celine tote, women's bags and purses are becoming more acceptable in men's wardrobes.

We are in some fun times,\" photographer Mordechai Rubinstein wrote recently on Instagram. \"A while back I posted a guy wearing a women's LV purse cross body. He took the strap from any old bag and put it on his mother's old purse .\" As a major driving force in contemporary fashion expression, hip-hop culture plays an integral part in this process. Tyler, the Creator has been rocking classic Chanel purses for a couple of years (check out dusty pink here or pale blue here). It feeds into the broader gender-bending fashion experimentation happening in hip-hop right now--think A $AP Rocky's Gucci babushka scarf or Young Thug's frilly blouses. Hip-hop culture has come a long way in challenging toxic masculinity while continuously incorporating an obsession with luxury fashion labels. If rappers are carrying Chanel purses, it's going to end up on the street soon enough. At the same time, the rise of the men's it-bag is also simply business. Bags are one of the largest sources of revenue for global luxury labels, so the math is simple: get men to buys bags and you'll sell twice as many bags. With consumption habits increasingly shaped by the more gender-neutral space of streetwear, the younger generation is becomes more comfortable with genderless shopping when it comes to accessories. View this post on Instagram Fendi might have been founded by Adele Casagrande & Edoardo Fendi, but it was Karl Lagerfeld who created the iconic inverted Zucca (or Double F) that everyone recognizes today. \"I drew the Double F in 3 seconds,\" he recalls in a 2013 documentary. \"It became the acronym of the house .\" ??: @ asap__r1cky @ highsnobietystyle #hsfacts A post shared by HIGHSNOBIETY (@ highsnobiety) on Jan 15, 2019 at 9:25 am PST Today, labels are trying to grasp the shifting meaning of luxury. The gender binaries of luxury fashion are blurring, but that can mean a curious migration of status symbols from womenswear to menswear and back again. \"Last year, we argued that sneakers had replaced handbags as the biggest status symbol in women's fashion,\" wrote Highsnobiety senior staff writer Lia McGarrigle recently. \"Looking to flex? A hard-to-get pair of kicks will impress a lot more than an off-the-rack <mark>Alexander Wang</mark> bag. It's not crazy to think the opposite could soon become true for men .\" In these uncertain times, luxury is a fluid business. Sometimes it's about inventing something new, sometimes it's about picking up something old like a classic Chanel purse and giving it a new spin. It seems the only thing that's left is deciding what to call it.
