Mr Hammond, who was named as chancellor of the exchequer by Prime Minister Theresa May last week to replace <mark>George Osborne</mark>, said the immediate response to Brexit slowdown lay with the BoE while he would spell out his fiscal plans in the autumn. \"The initial response to this kind of a shock must be a monetary response delivered by the Bank of England,\" Mr Hammond told lawmakers. \"And the governor, in announcing that interest rates were not to be lowered last week, did make it clear that the Bank is developing a monetary package that it will announce in due course .\" The BoE said on July 14 it was working on a possible package of measures to be announced on Aug 4 to cushion the expected blow from the referendum result to Britain's economy. Many economists expect it will halve its already record low Bank Rate to 0.25 per cent and possibly revive its bond-buying programme. Some have also speculated that the BoE might buy bonds issued specifically to fund infrastructure spending. In his comments to parliament on Tuesday, Mr Hammond said Britain needed a new framework to address its budget deficit, which he said was \"very large\" and needed to be addressed. Britain's budget deficit stands at around 4 per cent of gross domestic product, down from more than 10 per cent in 2010 but still among the largest of rich nations around the world. Mr Hammond reiterated his aim of protecting Britain's huge financial services industry from the Brexit fallout by securing its continued ability to provide services across the EU, and he said Britain would not be open to \"asset strippers\" seeking to buy companies in the country.

There are now a total of 1,112 confirmed cases in Europe's biggest economy, with the region of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) reporting 484 infections--the highest number among Germany's 16 states. In a bid to slow contagion, Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for gatherings of more than 1,000 people to be scrapped across Germany, which could affect many events including Bundesliga football matches. NRW state premier Armin Laschet said he planned to follow Spahn's advice in scrapping large gatherings in the state, meaning that several football games, including Saturday's derby between Dortmund and Schalke could be played in empty stadiums. Wednesday's game between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne would also be affected, said NRW health minister Karl-Josef Laumann. \"I will let the clubs decide if they want to play without spectators or if they prefer to not play at all,\" he told public broadcaster ARD. Also based in the region, second-division club VfL Bochum said Monday it has stopped selling tickets for upcoming matches. German Football League chief Christian Seifert has said the season must end by mid-May, in a sign that matches would likely be played behind closed doors in a bid to keep to the schedule. With measures taken to halt the virus hitting the economy hard, leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition agreed an aid package. The coalition \"is taking action in the corona-crisis. Besides medical protection measures, we have agreed on a big aid package for the German economy,\" tweeted Markus Soeder, leader of Merkel's Bavarian allies CSU, calling the package \"comprehensive\".

Our #FiveLions named in Gareth Southgate's latest @ England squad. pic.twitter.com/826clZFbwh--Tottenham Hotspur (@ SpursOfficial) November 8, 2018 Alli has been managing a hamstring problem, Dier has missed the last three games with a thigh injury and Eriksen has not fully recovered from an abdomen injury, yet all three have been called up by their countries for the games next week. That is not ideal for Pochettino, not to mention the other players that are still playing catch up from an extended stint at the World Cup, but he has no choice but to wave them off. \"Yes it is true if you said to me would you prefer all my international players stay here and rest for two weeks without competition, I would say yes,\" he said. \"But that is impossible. That is why we were talking before about Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen and international duty. Eric Dier has been called up for England despite missing Tottenham's last three games with injury (Nick Potts/PA)\" It is play, play, then move them there and play again. If you see our schedule for the next few months it will be so tough. How do you manage that? \"I understand we need to sacrifice some games for some players so they can cope with the demand in the future .\" Dier was named in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the games against the United States and Croatia shortly after Spurs had confirmed he was fit after his recent injury. With Mousa Dembele out for the rest of 2018 it seems likely that Dier will come straight back into the side at Selhurst Park. TEAM NEWS: @ mousadembele (ankle)--scans have confirmed ligament damage to right ankle and is unlikely to be available until the New Year. pic.twitter.com/twfAUTMoKh--Tottenham Hotspur (@ SpursOfficial) November 8, 2018 Even if he does not play, Spurs have no power to keep him. \"If he is fit and the manager calls him, he must go,\" Pochettino added. \"If he is fit but I decide not to put him in the starting XI we will need to get permission as well from the national team .\" Despite the injury problems, which have also seen Victor Wanyama, <mark>Danny Rose</mark> and Jan Vertonghen spend time out, Spurs have recorded their best-ever Premier League start, with eight wins from 11 games. Pochettino has masterminded it by using more players than any other side and he finally feels happy with his back-up players. TEAM NEWS: @ ericdier (thigh) and @ VictorWanyama (knee) have both returned to training with the squad. pic.twitter.com/pTCu6HUgh1--Tottenham Hotspur (@ SpursOfficial) November 8, 2018 \"Of course now every time I decide to pick my starting XI I have a name I feel comfortable to play,\" he added. \"It's so important. Because competition in football is an important thing that puts pressure on yourself. It's not only the pressure from the coaching staff, fans and club .\" It's from your team-mate. \"If you are not ready I'll take your place' .\" The most important thing is when you players start to feel pressure from their team-mates pushing you to move and be conscious and responsible to increase your level. That is a very good thing that happens in teams that need to win. \"0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2014110416_00090767_W", "names": {"Ian Holmes": ["Q22005026", "Q37389869", "Q5981826", "Q5981830"], "Stephen Thompson": ["Q11253984", "Q18588210", "Q57878587", "Q59587831", "Q7610676", "Q7610677", "Q7610681", "Q782348"]}, "date": "2014-11-04", "url": "http://www.mtbeurope.info/news/2014/1411003.htm", "content": "Auspherix secures AU $1m from MRCF to advance novel antibiotics pipeline Auspherix Pty Ltd, an early stage company developing novel antibiotics to treat bacterial drug resistance, has announced that it has secured a further with AU $1 million in a series A financing from Australia's Medical Research Commercialisation Fund (MRCF). It has also strengthened its research team. In less than 12 months since its foundation 2013, Auspherix has identified a number of antibacterial compounds with broad spectrum activity against a panel of clinical isolates of antibiotic resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Through a hit-to-lead programme conducted in collaboration with Domainex, Auspherix now has a better understanding of the SAR necessary to target the organisms and has improved the antibiotic activity of the initial compounds. The new investment will be used to further refine the lead compound series, and to screen these in in vivo models in collaboration with Evotec (previously Euprotec). Auspherix has adopted a virtual business model with research being directed by Professor Ian Charles CSO and founder of Auspherix, who is Director of the ithree institute at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The founding intellectual property behind Auspherix was in-licensed from the ithree institute based on research led by Professor Charles, together with Dr Dagmar Alber, ithree Senior Research Fellow. Professor Charles and Dr Alber previously worked together successfully at Arrow Therapeutics as CSO and head of virology respectively. The scientific team has been further strengthened by the appointment of Dr <mark>Ian Holmes</mark> as head of chemistry alongside Dr Alber as head of biology. Dr <mark>Holmes</mark> is an experienced medicinal chemist and pre-clinical project leader with a proven track record of program milestone delivery in large pharma and biotech environments. Past positions include Director of Medicinal Chemistry at Cancer Therapeutics CRC, Melbourne, Australia and prior to that at GSK. Auspherix has appointed two independent consultants to advise the Company: Dr Alan Naylor and Dr Mike Tarbit. Prior to his consulting career Dr Naylor spent 30 years in medicinal chemistry at GSK, latterly as Vice President, Head of Strategy and Operations and Director of Medicinal Chemistry at a UK-based centre of excellence in drug discovery. Dr Tarbit's career has spanned biotech and pharma, including at Inpharmatica, ArQule, GSK and Pfizer. Professor Charles said, \"It is now widely recognized that we desperately need to find new ways to combat infectious diseases including resistant bacterial infections. At Auspherix we are making rapid advances in optimizing potential antibacterial compounds with completely novel chemical structures which, if successful, will deliver the drugs needed to keep the threat from superbugs in check .\" Commenting on the second tranche of investment into Auspherix, <mark>Stephen Thompson</mark>, Chairman of Auspherix and Partner at Brandon Capital, the venture capital firm that manages the MRCF said \"Auspherix has made astonishing progress in less than a year, successfully achieving all of the key milestones. The potential to bring a new class of anti-infectives to market is an extremely exciting opportunity and we are pleased to have made an additional investment into the Company .\" "}]
