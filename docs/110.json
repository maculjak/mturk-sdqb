Morry Gash/Associated Press The super PAC backing Republican Jeb Bush is airing a new ad in Iowa criticizing rival Marco Rubio for skipping his U.S. Senate duties while running for president. The campaign, which will run for two weeks and cost $1.4 million, is the latest chapter in Bush backers' efforts to portray Mr. Rubio as overly devoted to campaign fundraising.

The ad also notes that Mr. Rubio has missed \"more total votes than any other senator,\" repeating a line that many of Mr. Rubio's rivals have used against him. Mr. Rubio's campaign on Tuesday pushed back on the super PAC's criticism. \"Bush's team dishonestly omits that Marco is on the Senate's Intelligence Committee, where he attended the highest level briefings on the Paris attacks,\" Alex Conant, Mr. Rubio's spokesman, said in a statement emailed to reporters. \"No other candidate for president has received more classified Intelligence briefings or better understands the threats facing our nation today than Marco. It's sad to see Jeb's\" joyful' campaign reduced to such intellectual dishonesty. \"The pro-Bush super PAC, Right to Rise USA, raised $103 million in the first half of the year--far more than any other candidate's allied super PAC--and has spent more than $30 million on TV ads. But despite spending considerably more than Mr. Bush's rivals, the super PAC has failed to move the needle for the former Florida governor. Mr. Bush is in sixth place among Republican primary voters, with 4.4% support, according to a Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls. In Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation caucus Feb. 1, Mr. Bush is in fifth place, with 4.8%, according to Real Clear Politics. Earlier this month, Right to Rise aired an ad campaign nationally and in four early states knocking Republican front-runner <mark>Donald Trump</mark> as\" impulsive and reckless \"and criticizing votes by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz that it said would\" dramatically weaken counter-terrorism surveillance. \"That ad also went after Mr. Rubio for skipping his Senate duties\" just to campaign. \"______________________________________________________ 2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls | 2016 Poll Standings Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern affairs and Internal Trade Dominic LeBlanc, is seen in a Dec. 7, 2018, file photo. It's not enough that politicians be clear of actual wrongdoing when it comes to misdeeds, such as corruption or improperly interfering with the justice system. They must be completely free of the perception that they have crossed these lines. This is a rule widely known, previously voiced even by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself. That's why we're left scratching our heads about a story concerning judicial appointments coming out of New Brunswick. As first reported by the CBC, five out of the last six judicial appointments in the province went to people close to federal Liberal cabinet minster and Trudeau friend Dominic LeBlanc. The individuals appointed include, according to the report, a \"neighbour, a LeBlanc family relation and three lawyers who helped retire debts from his unsuccessful 2008 leadership bid.\" The Liberal government has already released a statement saying all three appointments were merit-based. But Canadians will have a tough time stomaching that statement, regardless of its truth. That's because this isn't the first time the Liberals have shown they have a problem with judicial independence. A roll call of recent scandals related to the justice file is a troubling one. There's the Lavscam affair, which was never fully resolved. We wrote in past editorials in this space that the RCMP should be probing the question of whether or not individuals in the Prime Minister's Office broke obstruction of justice laws in persistently pressuring Jody Wilson-Raybould into offering a Deferred Prosecution Agreement to SNC-Lavalin even after the head of the prosecution service ruled it out. Trudeau began by describing the story as false until eventually parts of the real story got out and the PMO changed its tune to state that while Wilson-Raybould was pressured, it was all--in former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick's words--\"lawful advocacy.\" Then, there's the Vice-Admiral <mark>Mark Norman</mark> affair, where Canadians were left wondering why bureaucrats close to Trudeau even referred the case to the RCMP in the first place. Then, there's the reports that many judicial appointments were first screened through a database of Liberal donors. The Liberals clearly have problems with judicial independence. Skepticism around this latest story is highly warranted.

miami's new baseball stadium <mark>kevin gray</mark>, reuters april 1, 2012, 2:43 am miami, march 31 (reuters) - get ready, baseball fans. miami, the city of sun and fun, wants to bring some flair to america's favorite pastime. when baseball's opening day kicks off next week, the miami marlins will inaugurate a new $515 million ballpark built with all the trappings of south florida--two enormous fish tanks, palm trees and a kitschy (of course) home run celebration display. the stadium, named marlins park, \"screams miami,\" team owner jeffrey loria has said. the white semi-domed stadium is an attempt by loria and city officials to reignite fan interest in a team that won the world series in 1997, and again in 2003, but finished at the bottom of the national league east division standings last year. they also hope it will help revitalize miami's little havana neighborhood, a rough-and-tumble district near downtown and a cultural symbol for many in miami's large cuban community. the stadium's official opening on wednesday will mark a new chapter for the marlins, who have changed their name, redesigned their uniforms and embarked on a spending spree for a high-profile manager and free-agent players to breathe new life into the team. to win over fans, the marlins are offering up a baseball experience with a dash of latin and south beach style. the stadium's signature feature will be its backdrop at home plate. two 450-gallon salt water aquariums sit on either side and will be stocked with 100 tropical fish. \"when you think of miami, you think of water, right?\" said claude delorme, a marlins executive vice president. \"we wanted a unique piece that identifies where we are.\" the fish tanks are built of durable fiberglass and protected by a material used in bullet-proof glass. to ensure they would withstand impacts from baseballs, team officials brought in a marlins player to hurl balls to test out the glass. the tanks will be lit with blue lights during games to make sure players do not lose sight of the balls. \"home run sculpture' behind the outfield is a home run celebration display few will confuse with being anywhere but south florida. team officials call it a\" home run sculpture. \"designed by american pop artist red grooms, the 72-foot yellow, blue and neon pink structure features seagulls, flamingos, and a pointy-billed teal marlin that will leap every time a home run is hit. it is set next to - what else - palm trees. the home run celebration will also include a 34-second splash effect and laser show.\" some people have been critical of it, \"delorme joked.\" but it adds to the experience of coming out to the ballpark. \"no new ballpark in miami would be complete without a swimming pool. marlins park will be the second major u.s. baseball stadium after chase field in phoenix, arizona, to feature a swimming pool for fans looking to enjoy the game from a different vantage point.\" we wanted to have this party area in left field, \"delorme said.\" so people would see it on tv and say, you know what, i want to go there. \"about four feet deep, the pool is part of an area that was conceived with the clevelander, a well-known south beach party-goers hotel. the pool side area includes a bar and djs.\" there will be home run balls landing in the pool, so people will have to be alert, \"delorme said. built on the old site of miami's orange bowl, the stadium offers an intimate setting that will hold a mere 37,442 spectators - the smallest capacity in baseball. it also has a host of other amenities that fans complained were missing from the marlins' previous home, sun life stadium, in suburban north miami, where the miami dolphins also play. the stadium's roof is retractable - key when miami's rainy season sets in. air conditioning in the stadium will maintain an average temperature of 75 degrees to keep fans comfortable during florida's muggy summer months. the stadium, however, has not been without controversy. when plans for its construction were first announced, it drew howls from some miami residents who complained taxpayers were picking up the tab for three-fourths of the stadium's costs. it was financed using municipal bonds. the stadium's financing is now the focus of a probe by the securities and exchange commission. still, it has generated buzz in miami and team officials say they hope it proves to be a draw not only for baseball fans.\" you could bring someone here who does not like baseball and they could have a really good time, \"delorme said.\" and they'll want to come back. \"(editing by greg mccune and philip barbara)"}, {"articleID": "2018040320_00251247_W", "names": {"Tom Brown": ["Q1305209", "Q15992805", "Q16194983", "Q16195439", "Q28209484", "Q500029", "Q7002060", "Q7815092", "Q7815094", "Q7815097", "Q7815099", "Q7815100"]}, "date": "2018-04-03", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/03/reuters-america-update-2-elliott-takes-1-bln-stake-pushes-for-changes-at-hyundai.html", "content": "* Reveals stakes in Hyundai Mobis, Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors * Calls for clearer plan to improve corporate governance * U.S. hedge fund previously took on S. Korea's top chaebol Samsung (Add background on Elliott, past campaigns, Samsung) SEOUL/NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - A unit of activist hedge fund Elliott Management said on Wednesday that it holds more than $1 billion of shares in three key affiliates of South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group, and said more needs to be done to reform the company. In its latest challenge to South Korea's family-run conglomerates, Elliott Advisors called for \"a more detailed roadmap as to how it will improve corporate governance, optimize balance sheets, and enhance capital returns at each of the companies\" including Hyundai Mobis, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors. South Koreas auto-to-steel giant Hyundai Motor Group announced a plan last week to streamline its complex ownership structure as it responds to calls from the government and investors to reform the countrys powerful family-controlled conglomerates or chaebols. The plan will be put to shareholders for approval on May 29, but worries that a proposed restructuring plan would benefit the parent groups controlling family ahead of companys shareholders hit shares. While Elliott said it was pleased that Hyundai Motor Group has taken a first step toward improving its corporate structure, it said in a statement that \"more needs to be done to benefit the companies and stakeholders.\" Under Hyundai's plan, parts supplier Hyundai Mobis is to spin off its domestic module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with logistics affiliate Hyundai Glovis backed by Hyundai's family members. But some investors and analysts said Mobis could be giving away cheaply what is seen as the more profitable part of its business. After the merger, parent Hyundai Motor Groups Chairman Chung Mong-koo and his son Chung Eui-sun, who is vice chairman, will buy stakes in Mobis held by other affiliates Kia Motors, Glovis and Hyundai Steel. \"Elliott looks forward to engaging with management and other stakeholders directly on these issues, and to offering recommendations regarding the proposed plan,\" it said. A Hyundai Motor spokesman in Seoul was not immediately available for comment outside business hours. Last year, South Koreas new antitrust chief told Reuters that he has been in talks with Hyundai Motor Group about unwinding its circular shareholdings, which critics say gives too much power to its controlling family at the expense of shareholders. His commission welcomed Hyundai's latest decision. Elliott's call adds to challenges for Hyundai, which is struggling from slowing sales in China and the United States, due to its delayed response to the sport utility vehicle segment, and Seouls diplomatic row with Beijing last year. BATTLE WITH CHAEBOLS Paul Singers $33 billion firm Elliott Management has taken on Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest family-run conglomerate, as well as the Li family, which founded Hong Kongs third-largest lender Bank of East Asia. In 2015, Elliott narrowly lost its battle to block a merger of two Samsung Group affiliates that would allow the controlling Samsung family to consolidate their holdings ahead of a leadership transition. Like Samsung, Hyundai has a large foreign investors base. In 2016, Elliott called on Samsung Electronics to introduce a transparent holding company structure and pay a 30 trillion won special dividend, among other demands. In 2017, Samsung rejected the call for a holding company, but announced plans to cancel its existing treasury shares worth over $35 billion by 2018. Founded by Singer in 1977, Elliott is renowned for winning cases against Peru and Argentina for repayment of debts they took on at a deep discount during their financial crises. While U.S. hedge funds used to rarely target Asia-based companies for activist campaigns, it is now becoming more popular.

Eighth-seeded Khachanov rallied for a 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/4) 6-2 victory over the volatile Australian, but the final set was close to farce, with Kyrgios engaged in a running dialogue with Irish chair umpire Fergus Murphy. \"He has a really great talent but sometimes the head not in the right place,\" Khachanov said. \"It was a really difficult match for me--I had to really work it out, how to get the win.\" It's really tough (playing Kyrgios), not only for me but for everybody. You have to try and handle it, then you can have chances to win the match. Always try to stay in there. \"BANG, BANG!!???? Nick Kyrgios absolutely DESTROYED two racquets and the commentators lost it???? Watch the Cincinnati Masters live on ESPN. pic.twitter.com/q2d2dTeND3--ESPN Australia & NZ (@ ESPNAusNZ) August 15, 2019 Kyrgios, who won his sixth career ATP singles crown two weeks ago in Washington, also complained last week in Toronto in an apparent dispute as to why he could not have a white towel during a match. World number 27 Kyrgios, rarely far from controversy, was defaulted three months ago after throwing a chair as he quit a match in Rome. The latest iteration of the Kyrgios saga erupted after he lost the second set to Khachanov. Sitting in his chair at the pause, Kyrgios suddenly announced he was going on a bathroom break, with Murphy telling him there was no time. The Aussie walked anyway, carrying two racquets with him. Television showed him going through a stadium door partly made of glass and smashing his racquets before collecting them and walking back onto court. All the while, he was nagging and occasionally cursing at Murphy. Kyrgios calmly held his own at the start of the final set, producing a hold which featured three aces. But it was the ice-calm Khachanov who took advantage, breaking for 4-2 and running out to a 5-2 margin. Kyrgios, by now hardly in the match, double-faulted to hand over two match points and served up another double after saving a first match point. He refused to shake Murphy's hand on the way off court and tossed his shoes and other soft articles into the crowd and handing his broken racquets to young fans before walking off. At one point in the drama, Kyrgios stood at the back of the court, wrapping his racquet grip, which Murphy kept telling him he was not ready. Kyrgios told Khachanov to go ahead and serve, but the Russian declined until all was in place on the Kyrgios side of the net. Tournament supervisor <mark>Gerry Armstrong</mark> sat near the court, observing, but was not called upon to make any ruling during the bizarre closing stages of the evening. Khachanov will play Frenchman Lucas Pouille in Thursday's third round. Updated Date: Aug 15, 2019 11:43:31 IST"}]
