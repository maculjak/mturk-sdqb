Photo: Frazer Harrison / Charlize Theron was honored by Hollywood Friday for a\" fearless \"career in which she tackled themes including sexual harassment long before the #MeToo movement up-ended the industry. The 44-year-old South African Oscar-winner, who has often played down her flawless looks to win darker, more complex parts, collected the prestigious American Cinematheque Award at a <mark>Beverly Hills</mark> gala .\" I'm overwhelmed--I need a cocktail! \"she told AFP as stars including Kristen Stewart, Seth Rogen, and David Oyelowo gathered to honor her career .\" These people who are here tonight have been with me through a lot of stuff. \"Theron won the best actress Academy Award in 2004 with her turn as prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster. She earned Hollywood's respect with a visceral performance which saw her pack on 30 pounds (14 kg) and render herself unrecognizable with makeup and prosthetics to play the unappealing murderer .\" She is the most fearless actor I've ever worked with, and probably the most fearless human being I've ever met, \"said Jason Reitman, who directed Theron in Young Adult and Tully. Next month Theron appears in another transformative role--as former TV anchor Megyn Kelly in Bombshell, which depicts the downfall of Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes after a sexual harassment scandal .\" When I read (the script) it felt like it was part of a conversation that was happening now. And that to me, felt really important, \"she said. In contrast, her 2005 turn as a miner who files the United States' first class-action sexual harassment lawsuit in North Country came at a time when Hollywood turned a blind eye to such issues. Back then there was a sense that sexual harassment\" was in the past and that it's been dealt with, \"said Theron. The part earned her a second Oscar nod. A decade later, the #MeToo movement swept through Hollywood. Theron was born in the small South African town of Benoni in 1975. When she was 15, her mother shot and killed her father after he attacked them in a drunken rage. Her mother was never charged. Theron arrived in Los Angeles as a teenager in the 1990s speaking only broken English--her first language is Afrikaans. She was discovered by a talent scout in a bank, and broke into Hollywood's elite with The Devil's Advocate (1997), alongside Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino. Theron has since mixed commercial films such as the Fast and Furious franchise with tougher, less conventional roles. The American Cinematheque Award is a\" mid-career achievement award, \"with previous honorees including Al Pacino, Tom Cruise, and Steven Spielberg.", "articleID": "2019111010_00069891_W", "names": {"Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]}}, {"date": "2019-11-10", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/man-city-vs-liverpool-highlights-17219303", "content": "Sport Liverpool vs Man City LIVE highlights and reaction Fabinho, Salah and Mane pile misery on Guardiola amid handball controversy Live reaction from a costly Premier League defeat for Manchester City against Liverpool FC at Anfield.

Bernardo Silva scored City's consolation. City welcomed back Rodri to the starting XI and <mark>David Silva</mark> to the bench, but Ederson was out with injury. Benjamin Mendy was omitted from the matchday squad for tactical reasons. Liverpool took the lead through Fabinho, but City felt they should have been given a penalty at the other end for handball. Mo Salah's header shortly after made matters worse. Sadio Mane sealed the win after the break with a back-post header, before Bernardo Silva's late consolation for City.

He said: We showed many times. We have three teams in front who have more chances to be champions but we are going to try. I am so proud to see my team play in this stadium against this team. Can you win the league: I don't know. I'm not a magician. 19:03 Klopp's verdict on Liverpool's win Jurgen Klopp tells BBC Sport his side had to be perfect today to beat City: \"They were good. Oh they were good and we had to defend with all we had but we scored incredible goals .\" It was so tough to play, the intensity of the game was so clear. It was all worth it, really great. They pass the ball from outside, Sterling. How good did we defend him until then? Because you saw what happens when we don't defend him anymore. \"The boys were completely focused and concentrated. It was so good. It is the only way we can beat City, maybe other teams can do it a different way but this is the only way we can beat them .\" 18:57 Guardiola explains Mendy absence Guardiola tells Sky Sports Benjamin Mendy did not play for fitness reasons.

Why City lost: I am the first to congratulate Liverpool. At the end, the boxes, it is similar like the Champions League. That's part of the game. We lost because they scored three goals and we scored one. We need to grow and play away on big stages. The last 10/15 mins of the first half we played so good. The performance was so good. We tried. We never give up. That's why we won back-to-back. We want to fight to the end. We drop points for our fault. It is what it is.

Here, he gives away a foul against Raheem Sterling and then squares up to the City man to waste a bit of time. From the free kick, Gabriel Jesus heads over. (Image: PA) 86' - LFC 3-1 MCFC Final Liverpool substitute <mark>Joe Gomez</mark> is on for Mo Salah. 85' - LFC 3-1 MCFC Walker heads over Better from City, they build a move that ends in Kyle Walker heading an Angelino cross well over. 82' - LFC 3-1 MCFC Double penalty shout Raheem Sterling wants handball for a shot, before Gabriel Jesus is brought down as he races Alisson for the loose ball. Probably nothing in either call. 80' - LFC 3-1 MCFC So close! Raheem Sterling opts to square it in a great position but it's just behind Jesus. Missed opportunity. 78' - LFC 3-1 MCFC Firmino replaced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is on for Roberto Firmino. Jurgen Klopp is furious. He wanted that change made before City scored. 77' - LFC 3-1 MCFC KEY EVENT Bernardo gets one back About time! Bernardo scores as he converts Angelino's cut-back with slight help from a deflection. 76' - LFC 3-0 MCFC Nothing is working In the last couple of minutes, John Stones has driven pass well out of play, then <mark>Kevin de Bruyne</mark> completely overhits an attempted ball to Bernardo. Pep Guardiola looks exasperated. 71' - LFC 3-0 MCFC Heads have gone City are plugging away but their heads have gone. <mark>De Bruyne</mark> looks fed up with his team's performance, throwing his arms in the air when Stones' pass could only find Mane instead of the Belgian. Gundogan's attempted through ball to Sterling then was too heavy, but they still blamed each other for the lapse. 69' - LFC 3-0 MCFC Finally a City substitute Sergio Aguero is hooked for Gabriel Jesus. It's not been working in attack for a while, so this change is about 15 minutes too late. (Image: PA) 67' - LFC 3-0 MCFC Nearly a goal for Aguero How does Aguero not get a touch on this? <mark>Kevin de Bruyne</mark> is out on the left and his ball across the box is perfect for Aguero but the striker somehow misses the ball completely. (Image: PA) 65' - LFC 3-0 MCFC Sterling wants a penalty Raheem Sterling looks to be pushed over by Sadio Mane in the box and wants a penalty but the referee says no. Rodri gets a booking for protesting the decision. VAR back up the referee. 63' - LFC 3-0 MCFC City look beaten City just can't clear their lines, and every ball away is finding a Liverpool shirt. 60' - LFC 3-0 MCFC <mark>Milner</mark> comes on Jordan Henderson comes off, with former City man <mark>James Milner</mark> on to replace him. 60' - LFC 3-0 MCFC WATCH: Mane scores City's third Make your mind up who was at fault.

Raheem Sterling skips across the edge of the area, but the shot is deflected just over. 50' - LFC 3-0 MCFC KEY EVENT Mane makes it three Hammer blow. Sadio Mane squeezes in a header at the back post after good work from Jordan Henderson on the right.

One Twitter message written by the Fianna Fail politician said celebrity Kim Kardashian had a\" fat arse \", while another told how a\" black Brazilian dwarf with ginger hair \"sat beside her on a bus. Ms Clifford-Lee is a candidate in the Fingal constituency by-election which will be held on November 29, and has branded the publicity surrounding the tweets as a smear campaign. The controversial social media posts will be a headache for Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin. Wrong Attention has been drawn to the historical tweets on social media over the weekend and Ms Clifford-Lee last night apologised for any offence caused by the posts and admitted they were wrong. In July 2011, she tweeted:\" Just doing up inventory of items in my car when it was stolen by some knacker. I think I'm going to cry. \"In June the same year, she had responded to a tweet about fashion, which is now no longer available, with:\" I think some pieces are cute but others look like something from a traveller wedding. \"In October 2011, Ms Clifford-Lee tweeted:\" Was on Dublin Bus for the first time in about a year yesterday.

She said the tweets referred to are from as far back as 2011 and were posted long before she became involved in electoral politics .\" I want to be absolutely clear, the tweets were wrong and I apologise for any hurt or offence caused by them, \"Ms Clifford-Lee said .\" While it does suit some people to take my tweets out of context for their own right-wing agenda, I hope that the people of Dublin Fingal will not be distracted by personal smear campaigns such as this. \"Anyone who has worked with me since my election to the Seanad three years ago can confirm the role I have played in promoting progressive policies .\" I also actively supported the marriage equality referendum and the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment, \"added Ms Clifford-Lee. She said she wants the by-election campaign to focus on\" the very real issues that people face every day \". Triggered Ms Clifford-Lee listed these as solutions to transport, housing, health, childcare, climate change and protecting communities from crime. She was elected to the Seanad in 2016 following an unsuccessful bid for a Dail seat in the same constituency in that year's general election. Ms Clifford-Lee got more than 3,300 first preference votes in 2016. Fianna Fail has high hopes she will join Dublin Fingal party colleague Darragh O'Brien in the Dail in this month's election.
