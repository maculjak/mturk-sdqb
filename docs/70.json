bring it. got ironclad anti-religious arguments? do your worst. unlike a certain religion that shall not be named, you cannot\" insult' the trinity, or besmirch jesus. christ took on all the insult, curses, and besmirchment, and redeemed them with infinite love and death, and burst the tomb where we thought him safe and gone. from the festering wounds of the motoon wars, a certain religion that shall not be named can't handle controversy, mocking, or contradiction. it hasn't the rational tools, or the spiritual foundations. jesus said \"follow me\". . a certain prophet that shall not be named demanded submission, or beheading, or enslavement of opponents. that's where we are in the world: a resurgent desert-cult that cannot deal with truth or disagreement, versus a christian / roman / greek western world that allows for secularity, blasphemy, and unbelief. i'd rather use provocative facts and invitation and \"come, let us reason together\" and a little law & order - rather than mockery - to confront the desert-cult. in any case, we have a war on our hands, not a debate. we have a jihad demanding utter authority over all other claims, and submission - by hook or crook - of the west and christianity under the chains of islam. ~ he should have been one of the great writers of the 20th century, had he made different choices: but whittaker chambers was world-class great article-writer. most of his pieces were in chambers' piece on the libertarian saint ayn rand and her book fountainhead bears pondering, because too many folks consider her \"the real alternative\" to tyranny or the bad old ways. instead, perhaps she's a soft totalitarian in her own way, advocating ideas and politics and economics that - in the real world - would be a world-class disaster. as i've commented before on this blog, libertarianism is not an adult or comprehensive creed or answer to modern problems. rugged individualism and self-sufficiency are good, but within the wider range of societal and responsible principles, this dog won't hunt. i like my libertarian buds and allies on the free-speech thing, but we part ways before long in theory and practice. \"along with what is commonly called assault, the thug also kept telling bcf that he did not\" have permission \"to take pictures. it seems to drive lefties and islamists and other kooks crazy that, in a public place, anyone can shoot video of anything. which is, of course, an excellent reason to take a cheap video camera to such demos .\" ~ so: noted hater goes all paleo on the streets of toronto against a private citizen taking pictures and breaking no law. you know, gonna party like it's downtown gaza, where the hamas thugs beat-down, pistol-whip, bulldoze and butcher as they see fit. mafiastan - except it's canada. just imagine. . if only blazing catfur had been on the streets of gaza, where he could receive the proper jihad-style smiting, maybe even a crucifixion, where free speech and diversity don't get in the way of straight-forward attitude adjustment on infidels. \"keep it peaceful?\" then again, it would seem that the thumbsuckers of the toronto pd tricycle division are well on their way to bringing that dystopian diversistan into existence, where the rules run only one way, and where assault means a conservative infidel possibly resisting the assault on him by one of the bully-classes. ali mallah? you or your parents were welcomed here to partake of our peace and civil society that canada (part of western christian civilization). actions like yours give the impression of immense ungratefulness, anti-western and anti-canadian and anti-freedom attitudes. you can take the barbarian out of barberia, as they say...as for canada being infiltrated by hate? mallah is pro-terror, a former vp of the ontario ndp, and a honcho in the bolshie cupe union. oh, and catfur? you may be a hobbit, but you got more cojones than a busload of malicious mallahs and their hizbie & hamas bullies. i wish i were in toronto with you, to stand beside you. trudeau, successive liberal regimes expose canada to chinese, russian spies ~ item: chinese intelligence activity in other countries: \"former chinese spies have reported that china has more than 1000 spies in canada, more than in any other country outside china. the canadian government fears that the chinese have stolen considerable business and industrial secrets from the country\" commies on the brain here at binks-hq. . i've been reading on mao, che, alger hiss, whittaker chambers, the venona spy intercepts, and spy works in canada. what occurs to me is that the jihad infiltration of the west can fruitfully be thought of as cold war 2.0 - people of an anti-western faith, committed unto death, misusing and reshaping language to hide and redefine their activities of infiltration, subversion, and influence. from the 1930s onwards, soviet agents infiltrated western governments, either to steal information, place sleeper agents, or agents of influence to change the policy of western governments towards soviet goals, or against the best interests of the west. only some of those agents were ever caught or self-revealed in canada, the united states, or england in the spy scandals of the 1940s to 80s. alger hiss, kim philby, igor gouzenko, and many other names haunt our history. the jihad - violent, subversive, and otherwise - is much with us, and has infiltrated parliament, universities, and major canadian cities. we have canadian money funding terrorism, and terror-plots in canada. we have sharia-zones with polygamy (on the government dime), child-brides for sale, and where radical mosques teach the death of canadian society and the victory of muhammed and his religion over the world. in the soviet infiltration, most canadians didn't pay attention - aside from igor gouzenko in 1945, or the brief spy-frenzy which followed. we never had a proper reckoning like the u.s hiss-chambers case, or the rosenburg trials (yes, they were both guilty). the left is still after those scary neo-nazis. . no such bugaboo as a neo-commie. now, most people are looking the other way at jihad, aided and abetted by the cowardly or politically correct media, and our puzzled and compromised elites. no more coddling of the radicals, or government hand-outs, or treating suspect muslims as quaint multicultural artifact. the nice muslims were the people who came here before the 80s. their kids and grandkids and the new immigrants cannot be assumed to love canada as she is, but only as she will be when raped, burka-ed, and made to submit to muhammed. as for communism, china is still spying our pants off. of kilts & bagpipes. not sure about haggises, but there ye go, aye? so let's not go go on and on about turbans, kaffiyehs, kirpans, niqabs, yarmulkes, and all the multi-culti / religious permitted dress in western societies. the attempted banning of the kilt is clearly a strike at scots, and manly men (of whatever hue). manly men wear kilts. sexy chicks wear kilt-like dresses. scots history is an indispensable part of the development of responsible government versus the absolutism of kings - or, we might say in this age, the absolutism of petty bureaucrats and powerful busy-bodies. a instakilt-towel, but teh binks-dad has the full modern-style gear. i'd love to buy something similar one day, or a great-kilt (think liam neeson in rob roy, not <mark>mel gibson</mark> in those kilt-ette hollywood silly things he invented for braveheart. . aside from the fact that wallace was a lowland knight = chainmail, not kilts). heck, i even like hands off the kilt, and don't touch my sporran! the worst part? one of the kilt-banners - the jackson missouri high school principal - is one mr. rick mcclard. the alberta school superintendent (westwinds school district) doug bennet compared kilt-wearing to students sporting flip-flops or short-shorts to school. duhr. why not (politely) let raymond high principal mark beazer, principal [mark.beazer @ westwind.ab.ca] and superintendent doug bennet [doug.bennett @ westwind.ab.ca] know what you think? maybe next time someone should argue that authentic \"traditional scottish garb\" includes a targe (shield), dirk (wicked long-knife), sgain dubh (boot-knife), and \"vast sums of money, corporations and dc politicians form one immense incestuous mass of goo that laps the banks of the potomac and poisons the body politic. rich people never have to take responsibility-in this life .\" ~ sad to say it, but there's barrels of blame to go around for everybody on the bp oil disaster in the gulf of mexico. obama? lotsa oil-money donations to his crooked campaign. . and there's always that award he handed out. his non-handling of the situation? the oil company? not planning for the inevitable fail? epic fail! democrats? created no-go oil zones cover the u.s. offshore, so that (a) china has more drilling rights off cuba and mexico that the u.s. does, and (b) oil companies are drilling bigger and deeper and more potentially disastrously to exploit the areas they are allowed to drill in. oh, and all that jet-setting to copenhagen and hawaii and all? rep. <mark>john porter</mark> (r-nevada): \"speaker pelosi's private jet costs $50,000 to fly from san fransisco to dc and burns 11,000 gallons of jet fuel. the rest of us are suffering from higher cost of living and lower quality of life .\" never mind gore's mega-mansion, giant jets, and all those smug twits in coal or oil-powered electric cars (at one remove, of course) feeling smug about their toxic-battery enviro-horrible cars. repubs? oh, the kick-backs, look the other way, the intimate entanglement of the political class with the corporate class, and all the rest. bush kissing that saudi guy and walking hand in hand - yeah, we get it. enviroids? see democrats above, plus their desire to cripple and punish oil companies as evil incarnate. safe and easy to fix alternative sites not a mile underwater? gosh, no. enviroid-fail like ddt, global warming, and so many other environmental idiocies, the consequences of the enviro-theories mean death, pollution, and worse in the real-world. they proclaim themselves the righteous crusaders, yet are as dirty and compromised as everybody else - and all to often, steam along on the government dime. so: we have a world-class hard-to-fix environmental mess because of. . well, everybody, especially the ones point fingers at everybody else. obama has failed - yet again - a real-world crisis; the democrats and enviros made the rules that made such an incident almost inevitable, no matter how careful the drillers and amazing the technology. solution? stop banning drilling in alaska, the offshore, and in the tens of thousands of other places better and easier to clean up than a mile underwater in the gulf of mexico. plus, build new refinery & storage capacity for the u.s. now. stop using the piping furbish fuchsia plover mugwort as an excuse to forbid legitimate development; stop hating the u.s. as the greatest engine of progress and change and generosity the world has ever known; stop raping the environment indeed - have reasonable safeguards and all that, but not the current insane situation invented by the democrats, benefitted from by all, and preached over by the enviroids. the side-benefit will be that american sovereignty will be protected, and the islamic world domination project known as saudi wahabbism will no longer be funded by the target-nation. oil independence has been talked about for years, but is not in the interests of the america-last crowd, nor the up with islam bunch (including obama) currently running dc and america. imagine iran threatens nuking the persian gulf oilfields - there's the end of the world as we know it. time to do something about it before we're left wondering why we didn't do something about it while there was still time. ~ one area in which some muslims seem a bit embarrassed is the marriage of 6-year old aisha to 56-year old muhammed. of course, he heroically didn't sex her up vaginally until she was 9-years old. gotcha. here's a thought experiment. the 56 year-old prophetess aisha marries a 6-year old boy, but doesn't make him have sex with her until he's 9. yup, it's eww-factor 10! horny granny has the hots for a grade 1 kid, but restrains herself until the lad's in grade 4. that is: if muhammed violates natural justice (and the common practice of mankind) by advocating paedophilia against girls, why should we believe him on any other topic? what other \"great religious leader\" of the past ever taught the same? after all (again, simply following the nearly-universal custom of humanity and natural justice), if male-female sexual union is (first) for the procreation of children, then for pleasure and couple-bonding - that has little to do with poor young exploited aisha. a child of her time, aisha probably did not sexually mature until 12-13 years old, and thus could neither get pregnant, nor experience meaningful sexual pleasure (or vaginal lubrication) via an old man. this is the figure who inspires a billion people, and the perhaps 300 + million of jihadi / sharia supremacists as \"the perfect man' who is a model for all muslim believers. hence the child-brides and bought and sold women and polygamy of some muslims: it's all from muhammed's own bad example. aside from aisha, muslim history indicates that muhammed had over 66 different women and wives and concubines, like any ancient potentate or modern cult leader. all because\" allah told me so \". really? a horndog blaming god for his lusts is really a bit rich. imagine if christianity taught that joseph married a 6-year old mary, or that jesus had sex with that 12-year old he raised from death, instead of healing her and giving her back the fullness of life which was only then beginning to flower in her, and unfold over the next 5-8 years - grown-up faith, adulthood, family and children and husband, according to her wishes and those of her family, and god's will and purpose for her. that's the pattern of adam and eve, of both male and female being made in the image of god, and in christ, being truly free and equal:\" and a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife \", says jesus,\" and the two shall become one flesh. \"- that's a christian doctrine based on the inherent equality and dignity of man and woman - that's not what muhammed lived and told others was the way to act. a six-year old or nine-year old maybe many things, but a wife is not one of them. when we throw away christian anthropology, we have the polymorphic couplings of sexologists, or various\" customs \"or\" breaking of taboos \"- i.e. the time-tested, god-given foundations of western society in the family. the divorce & contraception culture has touched and changed us all, and done more damage to individuals and families and societies than we can even recognize. sorry to beat on this drum, but since islam is the leading religious threat to the west (with liberalized christianity in second place), it bears pondering, according to the light of reason and revelation. it's not a forbidden topic, because god is truth, and in him is no darkness - we don't have to perform verbal or faith-based acrobatics to justify the creepy behaviour of muhammed, because he was a sinner like all the rest of us, however much he said that\" god told him to \". ~ these days, our dreams and wonderings may be seen in movies. the post-apocalyptic side of our soul has had two interesting contributions recently: the road (starring <mark>viggo mortensen</mark>), and the book of eli (the denzel). what is it about that question of the end of the world, surviving, and the collapse of all we know and trust which is so compelling? do these dreams foreshadow the future, or remember the impoverished ages of the past, or the hints of the end seen in a century of war and death camps and famines? both? the truth is, of course, that our western technological comforts and certainties are a house of straw. disaster, war, terrorism, an asteroid, a few nukes is all that it would take to knock us back several hundred years. there's a greedy-for-doom side of the enviropocalypse crowd, as if they would call down doom on us for our enviro-sins. the spiritual impulse in man is innate to us, however it may get bent, misplaced, or wrong-headed. visions of flooding, super-storms, scenes to rival the depictions of end things in the bible seem to almost delight a certain kind of mind - making the greenpeacers much of a kin with end-times evangelicals. a mere 73 000 years ago, the indonesia toba super-volcanic eruption did kill off all but the toughest and luckiest humans, by hiding the sun and killing off a lot of animals and plants. some scientists guess that a mere 5 000 of our african ancestors survived the big smokey, to repopulate the earth to the point we're at today. life is fragile, fleeting, and although westerners are blessed with the richest, safest, healthiest civilization in the history of ever, to take that for granted - or to forget that others already live on this same planet with us in sometimes semi-apocalyptic circumstances - is to forget our mere luck, and our massive opportunities and responsibilities. in any case, death comes to most of us give or take a century - we all have to live well and die well, and ponder whether this world is it, or the beginning of a greater life. <mark>viggo mortensen</mark> is one of the great actors of our time, propelled to stardom by his portrayal of the king-to-be aragorn in the gruelling trilogy of the lord of the rings. while the road isn't mad max exciting, it's an intimate tale of a father and son wandering in the burnt aftermath of world-wide disaster, seeking to stay alive and stay human .\" from rushdie to van gogh to the motoons, law enforcement has guarded the thugs and harrassed those who draw attention to the thuggery. this is pc policing: there are identity groups who merit the solicitude of the constabulary, and there are the rest of you who don't. \"kathy shaidle - lotsa blogging going on. ~ from our bulging\" at least jerry lee lewis could play the damn piano' files...black conservatives discuss <mark>bill maher</mark>'s weird comments about obama my husband-blogger assaulted by union executive at anti-israel rally, toronto (scroll down for updates) breaking: canada's \"hate crime/pre-crime' law suspended temporarily <mark>michael moore</mark> says fox news edited footage to make president look bad shorter david frum:' i can't get my facts straight - but rush has ugly furniture' thanks to <mark>michael moriarty</mark> for mentioning our book,\" the tyranny of nice' because kilts are a symbol of primitive, white-person macho militarism?
