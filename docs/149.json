The legally nonbinding agreement signals that the parties aim to \"work to connect and grow business between the Mission Business Park and the Port of Brownsville,\" according to an official statement. Patty Gonzales, the port's director of communications, said that although the MOU is nonbinding, it does indicate and \"seriousness and mutual respect .\" \"While the port has long worked with all chambers and EDCs up and down the Valley, this just kind of defines our relationship a little bit more,\" she said. \"Where it makes sense we'll share information that pertains to economic development in the region, not just economic development for Mission or the Port of Brownsville, but up and down the Valley .\" The port, which already has ties with economic development organizations in Cameron County, made overtures to EDOs across the Valley and Mission was the first to respond, Gonzales said. She cited Southwest Steel Coil, a Mission-based company that imports steel through the port, as one instance of the cross-Valley bond. \"That's one example of how we work together,\" Gonzales said. \"This is really the port working to fulfill its regional potential. The Port of Brownsville is the Valley's port .\" Teclo Garcia, Mission EDC's director of strategic partnerships, said his organization and the port had been talking for some time about coordinating, which makes sense given the asset of Hidalgo County's international bridges. \"We can try to drive traffic to the port and vice versa,\" he said. Garcia said having a deepwater port just down the road is an effective tool for recruiting companies to the business park. \"Especially when you're talking to a bigger factory or company that needs deepwater port access, they ask those kind of questions: What kind of interstate access to do you have? Do you have a port nearby? We haven't had the occasion yet but we hope to be able to use that,\" he said."}, {"articleID": "2017072413_00543668_W", "names": {"Richard Robinson": ["Q22280073", "Q25711399", "Q28058362", "Q51590316", "Q55713112", "Q7328701"]}, "date": "2017-07-24", "url": "http://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/showbiz/2017/07/24/mental-health-crisis-in-music-industry-as-campaign-launched-following-chester-benningtons-death/", "content": "\"Mental health crisis' in music industry as campaign launched following Chester Bennington's death Less than an hour ago Music Minds Matter aims to provide a 24/7 phone line.

(AP)--Federal authorities will coordinate with state and local law enforcement officers to crack down on violence in cities with high crime rates in the coming months after arresting hundreds of fugitives under a program underway nationwide, U.S. Attorney General <mark>William Barr</mark> said Tuesday. <mark>Barr</mark>'s announcement came as he joined other federal authorities and about 30 state and local law enforcement agents in New Mexico following the recent arrests of 330 fugitives in the state. The arrests had resulted from an initiative known as Operation Triple Beam, a U.S. Marshal-led program that began in 2011, officials said. <mark>Barr</mark> said a push in the past two years to increase arrests under the program had paved the way for more federal crime-fighting efforts that would see a boost in the coming weeks. He did not elaborate or say which cities would be targeted during a news conference in Albuquerque, where he said violent crime rates \"remain stubbornly high\" in comparison to the rest of the country. \"I don't think it's a secret to anyone here that New Mexico generally and Albuquerque specifically are experiencing a violent crime crisis,\" <mark>Barr</mark> said. The state has long struggled to overcome persistently high crime rates, which it has tried to curb with state law enforcement units deployed to arrest fugitives. Lawmakers also have pushed a range of reform measures, including a bill that called for more inmates to be enrolled in Medicaid so they have better access to drug and mental health treatment options after their release. The most recent FBI figures show New Mexico had the nation's second highest violent crime rate and its highest property crime rate last year. That's despite Albuquerque reporting a slight decrease in both categories for the first time in years. Crime in New Mexico's largest city accounted for more than half the state's crime overall. The data offers a broad look at crime in thousands of U.S. cities but can be inconsistent and incomplete. Jessie Damazyn, a spokeswoman for Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, a Democrat, did not comment directly on <mark>Barr</mark>'s visit in an email to The Associated Press. But she said the public safety mandate among community members called for long-term partnerships and more community policing, which typically calls for officers to spend enough time in specific neighborhoods to become a familiar and trusted face among residents. \"It takes all of us working together with our community to fight violent crime,\" said Jessie Damazyn, a spokeswoman for Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller. At the news conference, <mark>Barr</mark> called the state's criminal justice system \"subpar,\" which he blamed on policies that give judges broad discretion over whether to detain suspects awaiting trial. Bennett Bauer, the state's chief public defender, said he has seen no evidence that the state's pretrial release system has spurred more crime in the state. He added that <mark>Barr</mark>'s criticism amounted to a \"blame game\" on judges. \"If the feds really want to help our communities, they should stick around and help fund solutions to the problems underlying crime,\" said Bennett Bauer, the state's chief public defender. \"Help us provide more drug treatment, education, jobs and rehabilitation in our prison system .\" Of the 330 arrests in New Mexico, 10 of the suspects were wanted in homicide cases and 50 faced assault charges, the Justice Department said. About 90 of those arrested were wanted on drug charges, and about 56 pounds of methamphetamine and other drugs were seized. In the past year, federal authorities also touted arrests, and gun and drug seizures under the program in Salinas, California; Phoenix; Tucson, Arizona; and Lawrence, Massachusetts. In New Mexico, the arrests resulted from a three-month operation. <mark>Barr</mark>'s visit follows Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's recent announcement that a special state law enforcement unit would renew efforts to find fugitives. The unit's seven state police officers and seven corrections officers are expected to help reduce the 1,600 warrants for people linked to violent crimes in New Mexico. Bernalillo County Sheriff Manuel Gonzales said he welcomed the help fighting crime. His office assigned 100 officers--a third of its force--to assist with Operation Triple Beam, officials said. \"We're not done,\" he said. \"This is just the start .\" Most Popular 1 Anguillan

decade in custody following his capture in afghanistan at age 15 after being wounded in a firefight with u.s. soldiers, officials said. canadian public safety minister vic toews said that 26-year-old omar khadr arrived at a canadian military base on a u.s. government plane early saturday and was transferred to the millhaven maximum security prison in bath, ontario. the son of an alleged al-qaida financier, khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to killing a u.s. soldier in afghanistan and was eligible to return to canada from guantanamo bay last october under terms of a plea deal. but canadian prime minister <mark>stephen harper</mark>'s conservative government had long refused to request the return of khadr, the youngest detainee held at guantanamo. the reluctance was partly due to suspicions about the khadr family, which has been called\" the first family of terrorism. \"the u.s. defense department confirmed the transfer in a statement and said 166 detainees remain in detention at guantanamo bay. the toronto-born khadr was 15 when he was captured in 2002 in afghanistan, and has spent a decade at the guantanamo prison set up on the u.s. naval base in cuba to hold suspected terrorists after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. he received an eight-year sentence in 2010 after being convicted of throwing a grenade that killed army sgt. 1st class christopher speer during a 2002 firefight .\" his head is spinning a bit and it's going to be a real adjustment for him, but at the same time he is so happy to be home, \"<mark>john norris</mark>, khadr's canadian lawyer, said after speaking with his client .\" he can't believe that it is finally true. he simply can't. for very good reason he was quite fearful that the government would not follow through on its word and he's pinching himself right now not believing that this government has finally kept its word, \"he said. <mark>norris</mark> said khadr would be eligible for parole as early as the summer of 2013. he said khadr's return to canada comes 10 years too late. toews said the u.s. government initiated khadr's transfer and suggested that canada had little choice but to accept him because he is a canadian citizen. it will be up to canada's national parole board to release him, toews said .\" omar khadr is a known supporter of the al-qaida terrorist network and a convicted terrorist, \"toews said. toews called for\" robust conditions of supervision \"if khadr is granted parole. toews said in his written decision that he reviewed all the files forwarded by the u.s. government and said the parole board should consider his concerns that omar\" idealizes \"his father and\" appears to deny \"ahmed khadr's lengthy history of terrorist action and association with al-qaida .\" toews also said that omar khadr's mother and sister \"have openly applauded\" his father's \"crimes and terrorist activities\" and noted that omar has had \"little contact with canadian society and will require substantial management in order to ensure safe integration in canada .\" \"i am satisfied the correctional service of canada can administer omar khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of canadians is protected during incarceration,\" toews said. <mark>norris</mark> said it is regrettable that the minister is trying to influence the parole board. \"most of what he has said there is simply not true. it's part of the stereotype of omar that this government has been disseminating from the beginning,\" <mark>norris</mark> said. he added that once the correctional service \"will get to know omar\" they will \"recommend appropriate conditions .\" defense attorneys have said khadr was pushed into fighting the americans in afghanistan by his father, ahmed said khadr, an alleged al-qaida financier whose family stayed with osama bin laden briefly when omar khadr was a boy. the egyptian-born father was killed in 2003 when a pakistani military helicopter shelled the house where he was staying with senior al-qaida operatives. omar's youngest brother lives in toronto and is paralyzed after being shot in the attack that killed his father. another brother was released from a canadian jail last year after successfully fighting extradition to the u.s. on charges he supplied al-qaida with weapons in pakistan. the father was arrested in pakistan in 1995 after a bomb attack targeting the egyptian embassy in islamabad, but was released after former canadian prime minister jean chretien appealed to pakistan to give him due process. canada was embarrassed when he later emerged as a senior al-qaida figure. canadian governments have since refused to speak out on behalf of the khadr family. omar was found in the rubble of a bombed-out compound badly wounded and near death in afghanistan in 2002. his case received international attention after some dubbed him a child soldier. khadr's family did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment about his release. <mark>norris</mark> said he told the family saturday morning that omar had returned to canada. <mark>norris</mark> said it's not for him to say whether omar should live with his family once he's released. \"you can't change the fact that they are his family,\" <mark>norris</mark> said. \"they love him and i know that they'll find a way .\" <mark>norris</mark> said khadr has received some education in guantanamo bay and hopes that will continue so that he's able to reintegrate into the community. khadr has claimed in the past that he was abused at guantanamo, but canadian foreign affairs officials said they accept u.s. assurances that khadr was treated humanely. human rights groups have long criticized <mark>harper</mark>'s conservative government for not doing enough for khadr, and the supreme court of canada twice ruled that the canadian government had violated his rights. canada's three opposition parties demanded that <mark>harper</mark>'s government bring khadr home. he has received some sympathy from canadians, largely due to his age and the torture allegations, but his family has been widely criticized. u.s. defense secretary leon panetta signed off on khadr's transfer in april. panetta said in ottawa earlier this year that sending khadr back to canada would be an important step because it would serve as an example to other detainees who are looking to return to their home countries or other places. some guantanamo detainees have been reluctant to agree to plea deals after noting that khadr had remained in guantanamo despite being eligible to leave since last october. suzanne nossel, amnesty international usa executive director, said the guantanamo prison should finally be closed. she said canada now has a chance to right what she called the many wrongs against khadr and called for an investigation into khadr's allegations of torture. \"given the obama administration's glacial pace towards closing the u.s.-controlled detention center, little and late though it is, today's news represents progress,\" nossell said in a statement. \"khadr was imprisoned at the age of 15, subjected to ill-treatment and then prosecuted in a military commissions system that does not meet international fair trial standards. growing up in guantanamo and facing more prison time in canada, his future remains uncertain .\" the new york-based center for constitutional rights released a statement calling khadr's case \"one of the ugliest chapters in the decade-long history of guantanamo .\" 2 injured

know about the \"Real Housewives' franchises Louis Baragona Bravo\" Real Housewives of Miami .' The \"Real Housewives\" franchise make up some of Bravo's most popular shows, spanning from New York to <mark>Beverly Hills</mark> and beyond. What goes on behind the scenes may be even more dramatic than what you see on television. These are 17 things you probably didn't know about the \"Real Housewives\" franchise. From the outside, Bravo's \"Real Housewives\" appears ultra-glam. There are luxurious trips, fancy cars, and designer clothes, all appearing among drama-packed feuds as well as silly, meme-worthy moments. Sometimes, it's hard to know what exactly is real about the popular reality show. Are those phone calls happening in real time? Is the drama organic? These 17 strange, little-known facts prove that sometimes the truth behind the glamorous world of reality television is much stranger than fiction--and the lines between the two are often blurry. The \"Real Housewives\" franchise isn't limited just to the United States. Slice \"Real Housewives of Vancouver .' Though the show has seen hundreds of wives in its iterations across the country, spanning from <mark>Beverly Hills</mark> and Orange County to New York and New Jersey, those aren't the only wives on TV screens. International versions of the show, including\" Real Housewives of Vancouver, \"\"Real Housewives of Athens,\" and \"Real Housewives of Israel,\" are broadcast in their respective countries. Vicki Gunvalson is the first (and longest-running) housewife in the original franchises. Gunvalson was a member of the original \"Real Housewives of Orange County\" cast, which made up the very first version of the show. Over nearly 13 years, fans have seen Gunvalson in just about any and every situation, from screaming about \"never having been with multiple partners\" on a ski slope to screaming about being forced to ride in a \"family van\" to the airport. \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" scores the highest ratings most consistently. Bravo Nene Leakes on \"Real Housewives of Atlanta .' The wives of Atlanta tend to garner the most consistent ratings. Nene Leakes was, at one point, considered the\" highest rated \"castmate in the franchise. At its peak,\" RHOA \"captured an audience of nearly 4 million live viewers. Recently, though,\" Real Housewives of Orange County \"came out on top in terms of ratings. Currently, it's the most-watched version of the series. Bethenny Frankel may be a millionaire now, but she made way less her first season. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Bethenny Frankel. Bethenny Frankel is known as one of the show's biggest breakout stars, having used her fame to create major wealth for herself and her business, SkinnyGirl Cocktails. In 2015, Frankel told INSIDER she made only $US7,250 total for her first season as a castmate on the show. The first castmate to ever throw a glass of wine was Tamra Judge. Bravo The moment the wine was thrown. Wine throwing has become a\" Real Housewives \"signature move, all thanks to the originator of the action:\" Real Housewives of Orange County \"star, Tamra Judge. At the time, Judge was fighting with a former cast member, Jeana Keough, and threatening her with a\" cyst and deceased. \"After things got heated, Judge threw red wine in Keough's face. Eventually, Judge apologised. Since then, Brandi Glanville, Danielle Staub, and many other wives have taken to chucking vino during heated arguments. And the first wife to ever walk off a reunion was Ramona Singer. Reunion walk-offs have become par for the course, with wives bolting due to sadness, anger, or just for dramatic effect .\" Real Housewives of New York \"castmate Ramona Singer was the first to walk off at a reunion, simply because she didn't want to continue the conversation. As the rest of the cast discussed fellow wife Alex McCord's nude photos, Singer made her exit. At the time, she said she had to use the restroom, but it was later revealed Singer was uncomfortable with the racy subject manner and the possibility of her daughter being somehow affected by the topic. Cast members have claimed that some on-camera phone calls are staged. Bravo Teresa Guidice on\" Real Housewives of New Jersey .' According to the aforementioned McCord, scenes in which the shows' stars are using the phone are usually doctored. According to accounts, producers will instruct castmates to call each other at pivotal moments of high emotion, usually when the timing is ripe for drama. And those dining scenes can apparently be filmed during very weird hours. Bravo \"The Real Housewives of Orange County .' Turns out\" Real Housewives \"stars don't eat in the emptiest restaurants in their respective cities. Instead, McCord revealed, producers arrange for the stars to eat at off-peak hours in restaurants. Why? The answer is surprisingly technical. A crowded restaurant means more people could end up on film. For people to appear on television, they must sign release forms. The more people there are in a restaurant, the more releases production is responsible for procuring. To avoid losing track of all the extra paperwork, production asks the wives to eat meals before or after typical times. For example, the cast might grab lunch at 10:00 a.m. as opposed to noon. Reunions take a ton of time to film. Bravo\" Real Housewives of Atlanta' reunion. Reunions typically air in two-to-three-part specials, all broken up into around an hour per special episode. Filming the reunion actually takes up to twelve hours, according to E! Online. The idea for \"Real Housewives\" came from a not-so-real television show. ABC \"Desperate Housewives .' According to former\" Real Housewives of Orange County \"cast member Gretchen Rossi, the inspiration behind the franchise was the fictional television drama\" Desperate Housewives. \"\"[Desperate Housewives] inspired the\" Real Housewives' franchise, \"Rossi told Hollywood.com in 2012 .\" Honestly, I feel I owe a lot to [\"Desperate Housewives\" creator Marc Cherry] for creating a show that inspired a real-life version. One of the show's greatest villains may have paid for his spot on the series. Bravo Slade Smiley and Gretchen Rossi. Slade Smiley was known for dating multiple members of the \"Real Housewives of Orange County\" cast, but Smiley's role on the Bravo show may have started with a $US2,500 donation. According to then-girlfriend Jo De La Rosa, he paid $US2,500 in a charity auction for the prize of landing a small part on an unnamed reality show. Eventually, Smiley and Rosa ended up on the cast of \"RHOC .\" \"It was something that he wanted to do, we were engaged and as corny as it sounds, I did it for love,\" Rosa said on the 100th episode anniversary special. Smiley went on to date another wife, Gretchen Rossi, with whom he's now expecting a child.
