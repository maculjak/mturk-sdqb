On Saturday, his long search for vindication turned an important corner. CBS News correspondent Carter Evans spoke with him. \"I am honored to say I've taken an amazing position with the front office of the NFL,\" <mark>Banks</mark> wrote on his Facebook page. He'll be a manager in the football operations department. He says it's just now sinking in. It's an opportunity of a lifetime, it's something that at one point in my life, I would have never [thought] of happening. <mark>Banks</mark> had been accused by a high school classmate of a rape that never happened. He was just 16, a star linebacker at Long Beach Poly High, with a full-ride scholarship waiting for him at USC and a dream to play in the NFL. \"All I had to do was play my senior year,\" he said. \"The biggest year of my life .\" But it never happened. He spent five years in prison and another four on probation before his alleged victim admitted she made it all up. When <mark>Banks</mark> was exonerated in 2012, his story gained national attention, including a profile on 60 minutes. Even though he'd lost 10 years, he hoped--against all odds--that he could still make it in the NFL. He tried out for the Seattle Seahawks and finally took the field in a pre-season game last year with the Atlanta Falcons. \"It's a dream come true,\" he said. \"And if it all ended today, you know: Mom, I did it. <mark>Banks</mark> was always realistic about his chances of making it in the NFL and his career on the field, ended with that game .\" I chased the dream and I will continue to chase it as long as I can, but when it's over, that means it's just new beginnings in other places of my life. \"That included motivational speaking, where he caught the attention of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, and a new job .\" I just cannot wait to be in New York, working with the NFL, \"said <mark>Banks</mark>.\" Just continuing to use success as a response to everything I've been though in my life. \"In the end, his success off the field led him back to pro football."}, {"articleID": "2019050720_00377352_W", "names": {"Jessica Anderson": ["Q29950503", "Q458240", "Q6187084"]}, "date": "2019-05-07", "url": "https://www.heart.co.uk/news/uk-world/nurses-london-marathon-record-reinstated-as-o/", "content": "Nurse's London marathon record reinstated as \"outdated' uniform rule axed 7 May 2019, 15:21 | Updated: 7 May 2019, 15:56 An NHS nurse has had her marathon world record attempt reinstated after officials admitted rules over her uniform were\" outdated \"and\" incorrect \". <mark>Jessica Anderson</mark>, who ran the London Marathon in her scrubs with trousers, was initially told her bid would only count if she completed the race wearing a skirt. The decision had sparked outrage online. Guinness World Records (GWR) rules had stipulated that a nurse's uniform must include: a blue or white dress, a pinafore apron, and a traditional nurse's cap. A spokesman confirmed the change of heart:\" Over the weekend it has become quite clear our guidelines for the fastest marathon wearing a nurse's uniform were outdated, incorrect and reflected a stereotype we do not in any way wish to perpetuate. \"I want to take this opportunity to reassure everybody concerned that Guinness World Records is absolutely committed to ensuring we uphold the highest standards of equality and inclusiveness .\" Therefore, we unreservedly apologise and accept full responsibility for the mishandling of <mark>Jessica Anderson</mark>'s application. \"The initial decision sparked a passionate response on social media, where many nurses shared images of themselves in their uniform under the hashtag #WhatNursesWear.

Los Angeles Urban League and OmniWorks \u2122 are proud to announce the launch of their Entrepreneurship Workshop, a free two-day workshop that will give aspiring and existing small business owners a chance to get their questions answered and learn best-practices for starting and growing successful businesses. The first workshop will start November 2 nd from 1:00 PM-6:00 PM at Los Angeles Trade Tech College, and with more than 150 participants already registered, more workshops are being planned for early 2019. \"There's obviously a demand for quality entrepreneurial education\" said <mark>Brian Williams</mark>, Vice president and COO of Los Angeles Urban League. \"One of the main reasons small businesses fail is due to a lack of business and management education.

In Los Angeles, small businesses are especially important to communities of color. In fact, a 2015 study by the U.S. Census Bureau reported that Los Angeles County is a \"microcosm of [the] nation's diverse collection of business owners .\" The report reflected that \"Collectively, Los Angeles County was home to 631,218 minority-owned firms including 81,563 Black-owned businesses .\" However, the SBA reports that 30 percent of small businesses fail within the first two years.

The 31-year-old defender - who has made 293 appearances since signing in January 2007, has agreed a two-year extension to add to the eight years he has already spent on Tayside. Manager McNamara was delighted to secure Dillon on a new deal and told United's official website:\" I am happy to secure Sean for a further two seasons. He is immensely valuable to the club both on and off the field. \"On field, Sean has a versatility which means I can call on him to cover a number of positions and in the dressing room and as an ambassador for the club he is the model professional and the ideal role model for our younger players. Sean Dillon is delighted to have committed to Dundee United for a further two years\" It is very rare in today's football world that a player commits ten years to one club and by signing this contract, Sean has ensured he will be a United player for that length of time. \"His commitment to Dundee United is amazing and I believe he will continue to prove a valuable part of the squad for the foreseeable future .\" Dillon was ecstatic to have his future at Tannadice secured and said: \"I love playing for Dundee United .\" This Club is obviously a massive part of my life and the Dundee area is my family home.

After years of cutbacks, the IRS plans to add as many as 700 new staffers this year to chase after tax cheats. \"As we continue to operate with a constrained budget, an area of concern for all of us remains the significant decline in the number of employees across the IRS,\" said IRS Commissioner John on May 4 in an internal memo initially reported by the Wall Street Journal. \"With our budget down more than $900 million since 2010, there are unmet needs across the IRS and there have been few opportunities to hire new employees during the last six years .\" The numbers bear him out. Going back to Fiscal Year 2010 (FY2010), the number of revenue officers responsible for placing liens on taxpayer properties and forcing them to pay up has been slashed by 15 percent. Similarly, the workforce including revenue agents, who conducts audits of individual and business taxpayers, suffered a 16 percent reduction during the same time period. Furthermore, the audit rate for individuals dropped to 0.84 percent last year, its lowest level in more than a decade last year. This was the third consecutive year showing an audit rate of less than one percent. It's not like Congress hasn't been giving the IRS any money to operate, but the agency is constantly being pulled in different directions. Following five years of budget cuts, Congress upped the ante for FY2016 by $290 million, providing a total budget of $11.23 billion. However, most of those extra funds were earmarked for other uses, including improving taxpayer services and ID theft and security measures. Also, the IRS was recently tasked with enforcing penalties under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In the memo, Koskinen said that the IRS reassessed its resources halfway through this fiscal year. It found that it had enough left in the coffers to hire between 600 and 700 new employees in the enforcement areas. \"Our first priority for hiring this year was to address taxpayer service,\" he noted. \"We were able to add more than 1,000 W & I employees to our taxpayer phone lines after Congress provided $290 million specifically for taxpayer service, identity theft and cybersecurity .\" The decision to hire many revenue officers and agents also factored in other aspects, including retirements and other employee departures. \"In previous years, job losses across the agency have helped us absorb the funding cuts we have received, but left us with large gaps in various areas across the agency,\" said Koskinen. \"This year, we've determined that we have the resources available to hire these employees as a result of the rate of attrition in enforcement and your continuing dedication to find efficiencies to help us with the budget .\" The IRS Commissioner claims that every dollar invested in the IRS returns at least $4 to the Treasury. He says the number is even higher when it involves enforcement. The first group of new-hires is expected to be announced in several weeks. The employees will be assigned to the department with oversight of self-employed taxpayers and small business owners. Other high-level enforcement positions will be filed later in the year. The news about the IRS hiring was met with mixed reactions. Some of our nation's lawmakers even questioned how the IRS was able to suddenly come up with the cash. \"It was only weeks ago that they were saying they did not have the money [to hire more employees] and today they do have the money?\" said House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) in an interview with FoxNews.com. Chaffetz said he will be sending a letter to Koskinen requesting a complete accounting of the matter."}, {"articleID": "2011072815_00014974_W", "names": {"Charles Allen": ["Q1063538", "Q16150468", "Q19038456", "Q5075079", "Q5075081"]}, "date": "2011-07-28", "url": "http://khou.com/news/4M-Trinity-River-attraction-too-dangerous-to-use-126322603.html", "content": "gallery see all 15 photos? dallas - a multimillion dollar whitewater course along the trinity river in dallas is complete, but the park isn't open. and it won't open until a major problem is fixed. kayaker justin blake is one of the few who dares ride the rough water at the dallas waves park. officially, it's closed; too dangerous, city leaders say. blake now understands why after riding it for the first time this week. \"you could get seriously injured if you're not careful,\" he said. the city spent millions of dollars adding concrete dams to create the whitewater rapids. in march, construction was completed on the dallas wave and city leaders showed it off to the public. but it wasn't long before many realized that something was wrong. these rapids are far more powerful than expected, especially on a \"safety channel\" where waters should be calm, allowing even canoes to pass. \"it was very vicious,\" said teresa patterson, who was thrown out of her kayak by the water's force. it held her underwater even though she was wearing a life vest. patterson said she nearly drowned. \"i was getting really, really tired,\" she said. \"i think if i had to be there another minute, i might not have been able to fight to the surface, even with the life preserver .\" dallas soon quietly shut down the course. after spending $4 million on the project, city leaders now admit at least another $100,000 of work is needed to fix the channel and calm the waters. \"it's just been a big mess,\" said trinity river guide <mark>charles allen</mark>. \"it's had a really negative impact on my business. i've lost a lot of money myself .\" the whitewater project stranded <mark>allen</mark>, who used to give tours along the river. \"when they're closing recreation centers and libraries and laying off city employees, we really can't afford to be wasting millions of dollars that way,\" he said. \"they should have just left it alone!\" city leaders refused on-camera interviews, only sending a statement to news 8 that says safety is their highest priority. but directors of the project plan to hire an outside engineer to make sure - this time - the repairs work. that is likely at least a year away. critics say the timing couldn't be worse, coming just as the state tries to encourage more people to enjoy the rivers of north texas. instead, paddlers like eric neilsen now avoid the trinity. \"i think it's a boondoggle,\" he said. \"we have an unfinished project that may or may not ever get finished .\" that leaves many to worry that the only thing going downriver is taxpayers' money. e-mail jbetz @ wfaa.com print print email email this article share tweet facebook share share! x digg delicious myspace google buzz linkedin stumbleupon newsvine reddit previous article boy tried to save friend who drowned at north texas lake next article cowboys file lawsuits over luxury suites"}, {"articleID": "2018042200_00121500_W", "names": {"Bill James": ["Q18378575", "Q18687984", "Q2037014", "Q2903257", "Q4909587", "Q4909589"]}, "date": "2018-04-22", "url": "http://www.goupstate.com/news/20180421/charlie-boone-who-led-spartanburg-hostpital-for-30-years-dies-at-90", "content": "Charlie Boone, who led Spartanburg hostpital for 30 years, dies at 90 Saturday Apr 21, 2018 at 8:23 PM Apr 21, 2018 at 8:25 PM Chris Lavender Staff Writer @ LavenderSHJ Former Spartanburg General Hospital President and CEO Charlie Boone, a beloved leader who guided the local hospital through medical and technological advancements over three decades, died Saturday at Spartanburg Regional Hospice Home. He was 90. Boone led the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System from 1965 to 1995. Before coming to Spartanburg, Boone served as the chief operating officer for Duke University Medical Center. He also helped build the first hospital in Barnwell when he was 25. After leaving the Spartanburg Regional, Boone remained active in the community and kept an office at Spartanburg Medical Center where he would continue to visit, eating in the cafeteria and socializing with hospital staff. Mark Aycock, Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System executive vice president and chief operating officer, said he visited with Boone on Monday. The pair talked about all that's been accomplished in the healthcare system over the past few decades. While Aycock didn't work for Boone when he was CEO, the two did find time in recent years to get to know one another. \"We would talk about Duke basketball and current events,\" Aycock said. He said Boone was a source of wisdom who rarely offered unsolicited advice. Boone will be missed, he said. In November, an honorary sign was unveiled for Boone on a street near the hospital campus that connects Aimee Street to North Church Street. The Charles C. Boone Drive sign still stands in his honor. Boone received numerous awards in his lifetime, including the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Wofford College Alumni Association in 1980 and Citizen of the Year from the Spartanburg Kiwanis Club in 1982. <mark>Bill James</mark> was the healthcare system's chief of staff in 1994 and worked directly with Boone at the time. <mark>James</mark> serves as a member of the Spartanburg Regional board of trustees. Boone helped broaden the healthcare system's service, paving the way for it to expand into Cherokee and Union counties and parts of North Carolina, <mark>James</mark> said. \"People enjoyed working with Charlie because they knew he was there to support them and be nurtured by him,\" he said. \"Charlie Boone was also the best at public relations. He talked to people at all levels .\" Spartanburg County Councilman David Britt said Boone was someone that could be trusted. The county worked closely with Boone as the hospital expanded. Boone oversaw construction of new buildings, including the Montgomery Tower and the medical center parking garage. He also led efforts to improve access to care for the community, starting in 1966 when Spartanburg General began accepting Medicare. \"He could get anything done,\" Britt said. \"He was always visible to everyone at the hospital and put the hospital on the path to growth .\" State Rep. Rita Allison's husband Ron served on the hospital board for 16 years during Boone's time as president and CEO. \"It's a real loss for our community,\" Allison said. \"He did a fine job for Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System .\" A service honoring Boone will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Central United Methodist Church at 233 N. Church St., Spartanburg. Visitation will be held in the church fellowship hall immediately following the service. A private graveside service will be held at a later date."}]
