Addressing a press conference, NSF president Sukhdev Singh urged the four-member inquiry committee to expeditiously complete the probe within day and submit its report to the Vice-Chancellor so that action may be taken against Director TBS if found guilty of misusing the official position. Sukhdev alleged that irregularities and violation of University guide lines have been committed by the Director TBS in the last one year and this was established in RTI. Listing some of the irregularities, such as allowing use of convention hall for private functions and also trying to mislead by providing wrong information in reply to RTI, the NSF leader alleged that the incumbent Director was solely responsible for all ills in The Business Schools. He reiterated the demand for early submission of report by the 4-member high level inquiry committee. \"The committee must submit its report to the Vice-Chancellor within days so that action could be taken against the culprits who misappropriated Department money and resources,\" he added. Among those who were present in the press-conference included, Balveer <mark>Kumar</mark>, <mark>Sunil Kumar</mark>, Vikram Madhyal and Akshey Sharma.

But the Red Sox have been assured that is not the case. According to a baseball source, tests administered over the weekend led doctors in both Boston and Denver to believe that Ellsbury \"could not have damaged the bone further nor will he\" once he returns. Likewise, Red Sox manager <mark>John Farrell</mark> said the team inquired about the possibility that Ellsbury did additional damage and was told that a comparison of X-rays and MRI scans taken after the initial injury occurred Aug. 28 and last weekend supported the notion that Ellsbury didn't make things worse by playing. Ellsbury's foot will remain in a walking boot for another few days, according to <mark>Farrell</mark>. The center fielder will rejoin the Red Sox on Friday at Fenway Park, and before he resumes physical activity, he will be reexamined by team orthopedist Dr. Peter Asnis and foot specialist Dr. George Theodore at Mass General Hospital. \"To what extent any activities, even if that's the time frame for it to begin, we'll have a better read on that when he's seen,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. A few other notes before Clay Buchholz makes his first start since June 8:--The decision to put Dustin Pedroia in the leadoff spot was made with more than one game in mind. <mark>Farrell</mark> said Pedroia may be a better choice to lead off than Shane Victorino because he's a more patient hitter who sees more pitches. Victorino also has had great success in the No. 2 spot, so <mark>Farrell</mark> is tempted to leave him there. And by moving Pedroia to the top of the order, <mark>David Ortiz</mark> can move into the No. 3 spot, meaning the Red Sox will bring arguably their three best hitters to the plate in the first inning. Although Pedroia hasn't batted leadoff since 2009, he expressed a willingness to do so in Ellsbury's absence. \"It's only the first time up. That's it,\" he said. \"After that, it's pretty much the same .\" <mark>Farrell</mark> added, \"There was a little back and forth on it, and to his credit, he kind of brought it out initially and we kind of talked about it a little yesterday. I think this gives us a good look against a left-hander. One thing that we've really worked at is maintaining continuity, and if this is one that will give us that continuity until Jacoby returns, we're certainly willing to stay the course .\" --With Rays ace lefty <mark>David Price</mark> on the mound, rookie center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. isn't in the lineup. <mark>Farrell</mark> said Bradley \"is going to be in the mix\" to replace Ellsbury, but in certain matchups, the Red Sox will go with Victorino in center field and both Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava on the corners. \"We're not locked into any one thing,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"The fortunate thing is we've got depth and options .\" --Jarrod Saltalamacchia is back behind the plate tonight, although <mark>Farrell</mark> indicated he likely won't play more than back-to-back games because he's still managing some lower back soreness. \"He feels like he can go every day, which we love about him,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"I think it's probably smart, given what he dealt with, that we not run him out there every single day. But he's going to get the majority of the reps behind the plate. I'm not going to say it's going to be every other day by any means, but I'm a little bit leery right now to run him out there three consecutive days .\" --Despite being skipped for at least one turn in the rotation, lefty Felix Doubront will throw an extended bullpen session. \"There's some delivery work we've got to continue to address,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"He and (pitching coach) Jobs with Herald Media For back copy and collectible issue information please call 617-619-6265 .?

It was his mother telling him of his father's diagnosis. \"I had no idea what MS was, but from there on I developed an interest and decided to go into the medical side of things when I got home,\" <mark>Hammond</mark> said. <mark>Hammond</mark> went to medical school and became a neurologist so he could help his dad and many other MS sufferers. He specializes in MS and sleep disorders. \"This was the profession for me,\" he said. \"I had a lot of background and a real passion for it and because my father had MS I could relate to my patients with MS.\" <mark>Richard Hammond</mark>, 67, and a retired restaurant owner, said he is proud of his son's accomplishments. <mark>Richard</mark> began having symptoms in 1990 when his feet had the sensation of going to sleep and he was unable to move his legs. \"I was diagnosed in 1992,\" he said. \"I had an MRI done and the doctor called me on the phone and told me that he believed I had MS. He wished me good luck and told me there was nothing he could do for me .\" Things have changed since then. Today, there are 10 disease-modifying treatments that include oral drugs, intravenous medications and injections. <mark>Richard</mark> is on an oral medication that has helped keep the disease from progressing too much. \"We've made a lot of progress in understanding the disease and the immune system in regard to MS,\" said Dr. Bruce Bebo in a telephone interview from New York City. Bebo is associate vice president of Discovery Research at the National MS Society. \"The lives of people living with MS have been greatly improved through these treatments .\" MS is a chronic disease that attacks the body's central nervous system, Chris Hammond said. Approximately 400,000 Americans suffer from the disease. Symptoms vary and can be as individual as the person who has the illness, but there are some commonalities. \"Most people with MS have fatigue, heat intolerance and cognitive concerns,\" <mark>Hammond</mark> said. \"Some people have numbness and tingling, balance problems, ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) and vision, sleep and bladder problems .\" A lot of research is being done on the disease. Last week, researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School said they now suspect much of the investigation into MS has focused on the wrong part of the brain and say until now, research has been done on the brain's white matter. But the new study found gray matter is far more affected by the disease. <mark>Hammond</mark> said he is confident there will one day either be a complete cure for MS or a highly effective way to manage it even better. \"We've had some early success with T-cell vaccination and there's a lot of work being done in stem cell research, he said.

Sunday's surprise announcement came after weeks of speculation and no little ire over his bid to succeed Ben Bernanke, but his candidacy was ultimately felled by a lack of support from key senators. President Barack Obama confirmed he had accepted Summers's decision during a telephone call, in a move that boosts the chances of Janet Yellen, the current deputy chair of the Fed, taking over at the US central bank. Summers' run for the pivotal economic post had received backing from the White House, but in other quarters his efforts were undermined by fierce criticism of his record as head of the Treasury during Bill Clinton's presidency. His opposition to the regulation of derivatives-the often complex financial products blamed in part for triggering the 2008 global economic crisis-and his work on Wall Street had attracted particularly heated scrutiny. In stepping aside, Summers issued a letter stating that his withdrawal came at \"a complex moment in our national life,\" noting he had \"reluctantly concluded\" that his route to securing the job was not tenable. \"Any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal Reserve, the administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation's ongoing economic recovery,\" Summers said. The 58-year-old economist, a Harvard professor and former president of the university, worked for Clinton at the Treasury Department between 1999 and 2001, and served as Obama's chief economic adviser at the White House in 2009 and 2010. The latter role raised his prospects of taking over at the Fed, with several reports talking him up as Obama's preferred pick. In a statement following Summers's decision to withdraw, Obama praised his former aide's performance in government during the financial meltdown at the turn of the decade. \"Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,\" Obama said. Opposition to Summers That opinion, however, was not shared by several members of Obama's Democratic Party who sit on the Senate's influential Banking Committee. Last week, they said that they would oppose sending Summers's Fed nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote, effectively blocking Obama's favored candidate at a sensitive time in a still bumpy US economic recovery. Despite his stellar credentials, Summers's work for a New York City-based hedge fund and for Wall Street banks, which he would have been tasked with regulating had he been made Fed chairman, had come under fire. Like many senior economic advisers in US political life, Summers has racked up millions of dollars in speaking and consulting fees from financial firms, feeding accusations that he would have been soft on Wall Street. Earlier Sunday, Citigroup, one of several top US financial institutions that received billions of dollars in a bailout from the Obama administration, said Summers had stopped working for them as a consultant. With a reputation as a strong economist, Summers also struck many as overly brash, a man of sharp elbows in Washington's corridors of power, with several key lawmakers arguing that a more conciliatory chair was needed to take over when Bernanke leaves his position, likely in January. Yellen, 67, seen as highly experienced, now steps up as frontrunner to take over at the Fed. Although the White House recently said several other candidates were on a shortlist, the deputy chair is seen as a consensus candidate and there has been no indication that her confirmation hearings would hit trouble. Summers's decision to bow out was welcomed by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington-based political and consumer pressure group. \"He would have been an awful Fed Chair,\" said <mark>Adam Green</mark>, the group's co-founder. \"President Obama should appoint someone to lead the Fed who has not accepted millions in payments from Wall Street, and who will prioritize an economy that works for the little guy above further enrichment for the big guy,\" he added.
