That all changed on Saturday against the Falcons. The Eagles' O-line dominated in the trenches and helped guide the Birds to a 15-10 win to advance to the NFC championship game. What was the line missing down the stretch? Stefen Wisniewski. The starting left guard missed a couple games with an ankle sprain, but returned for the regular season finale. Then, he just happened to have his best game as an Eagle in the divisional round game. It also happened to be the very first playoff game of his career. The 27-year-old Wisniewski had played in 107 regular season games without getting to the postseason--more than any other player on the active roster. When he got his first shot, he certainly made it count. Because Wisniewski didn't just do his job against the Falcons. He was dominant and made things happen all afternoon. Here's a closer look at some of his impressive plays against Atlanta: good-wiz1a. png This first play came on the Eagles' second drive of the game. It's 2nd-and-3 and Jay Ajayi is about to break off an 11-yard gain right behind the hole Wiz opens up. Wisniewski is about to get to the second level after the snap and find linebacker Deion Jones, who is a dynamic player, but is also just 222 pounds. good-wiz1b. png At the mesh point, Trey Burton has come across to take care of the defensive lineman, while Wiz is getting out in front on Jones. He doesn't just block him, he's about to push him back. good-wiz1c. png Ajayi finishes the run strong, picking up 11 pounds. He rode on the back of Wisniewski the whole way. Here's a different angle on the block to get an idea of how far Wisniewski drove Jones back. good-wiz1v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz2a. png These next three plays happened on consecutive downs. They were the last two plays of the first quarter and the first play of the second. Wiz got in a zone. On this one, Wiz is about to take on big Ahtyba Rubin, who weighs 310 pounds. good-wiz2b. png good-wiz2c. png On this zone read play, Ajayi sweeps left, so the entire defensive line shifts that way. Rubin goes with the play, but you can see where Wisniewski opens the hole. He makes it pretty easy on Ajayi. good-wiz2v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz3a. png The very next play is a screen, which has been a big part of the Eagles' offense when it gets clicking. \"The screen game has been something we've worked on the last couple of weeks,\" head coach Doug Pederson said, \"and it had to get better as the season wore on for us.\" On this play, Nelson Agholor is at the bottom of the screen. He's about to come in motion to create some space at the bottom of the screen. That's where Wisniewski is going to get out in front to clear a path for Ajayi. good-wiz3b. png Ajayi is working through the line and is about to settle in his spot to catch the pass from Nick Foles. Meanwhile, Wisniewski gets to the second level to find a hat to block. good-wiz3c. png Then, Wiz just bullies Jones again. He really used that size and strength edge to his advantage and didn't let the quicker Jones get around him. good-wiz3v. gif This was an important play because it showed just how big of a key the screen game could be. A little later you'll get to see Wiz's most impressive play. It came on a screen later in the game. good-wiz4a. png This is the first play of the second quarter. After Ajayi picked up nearly 50 yards in the first quarter, he's on the sideline getting a breather so LeGarrette Blount is on the field. He's gonna run right behind Wiz. good-wiz4b. png Just after the snap, Wiz lends some help to Jason Kelce, who is blocking big 346-pound tackle Dontari Poe. He then turns his attention to Jones, who has become his whipping boy at this point in the game. good-wiz4c. png At this point, Wisniewski has picked up his second block on the play and you can see where Blount is going to find the room to sneak ahead for an 8-yard gain. good-wiz4v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz5a. png This next play comes about a minute later in the second quarter. The Eagles were running all over the Falcons but Foles was having trouble getting into rhythm. Pederson is going to find a way to get the ball into one of his playmaker's hands anyway. Agholor will take the ball on an end around and Wisniewksi is going to make it happen. good-wiz5b. png Lane Johnson swings around to get out in front of Agholor to provide a lead block, but it's Wisniewski who opens the hole. good-wiz5v. gif The Eagles gained 21 yards on this play to get them down the the 3-yard line. This led to their only touchdown of the game. good-wiz6a. png We went in chronological order, which allowed us to save the best for last. Wiz was incredible on this 32-yard screen pass in the fourth quarter. He actually blocks three guys on one play and forces one away from a tackle. Pederson caught the Falcons off guard by running a screen pass to the same side on two consecutive plays. He knew they wouldn't be expecting it. But it was still gutsy to run it on a key 3rd-and-7. good-wiz6b. png Just after the snap, Wisniewski gets enough of a block on Adrian Clayborn to give Foles plenty of time to deliver the ball. It's Wiz's job to let Clayborn through, but if he doesn't get a piece of him, the talented pass-rusher might have been able to blow up the play before it ever got a chance to develop. good-wiz6c. png good-wiz6d. png After getting the block at the line of scrimmage, Wiz gets out in front and takes care of the two defenders that get in his way. It's hard to see it with the photos, so take a look at his incredible play here: good-wiz6v. gif Pretty impressive, huh? This 32-yard screen pass got the Eagles across midfield and they eventually got close enough for <mark>Jake Elliott</mark> to kick a 21-yard field goal to put them up 15-10. It was a huge score because then the Falcons needed a touchdown instead of a field goal. \"I'll tell you, it was just set up perfectly for us and well-executed to have Wiz downfield and block one,\" Pederson said, \"but take out two, obviously helps the play.\" It took Wisniewski a while to prove himself this season. Even though he signed an extension this offseason, the Eagles seemed hesitant to give him the starting left guard spot. Isaac Seumalo was the starter going into the season and Chance Warmack was given the first shot to replace him when he struggled. Eventually, though, Wisniewski got the nod and has been playing at a really high level all season. The Eagles have three Pro Bowl or All-Pro linemen, but without Wisniewski this line just didn't seem to work. With him, they were dominant on Saturday."}, {"articleID": "2015020916_00012088_W", "names": {"Roy Moore": ["Q17466511", "Q27924997", "Q5302905"], "Anthony Kennedy": ["Q11171", "Q59192346"]}, "date": "2015-02-09", "url": "http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/world/article/same-sex-couples-marry-in-alabama-after-us-supreme-court-refuses-stay", "content": "World Same-sex couples marry in Alabama after US Supreme Court refuses stay Same-sex couples began marrying in Alabama after the US Supreme Court refused a request by Alabama's attorney general to keep such marriages on hold. - Reuters pic, February 9, 2015. Same-sex couples began marrying in Alabama on Monday, defying an attempt by the chief justice of the state's Supreme Court to block probate judges from issuing marriages licences to gays and lesbians. A ruling by the US Supreme Court on Monday helped clear the way for Alabama to become the 37th state to allow same-sex couples to marry. Justices refused a request by Alabama's attorney general to keep such marriages on hold until the court rules whether laws banning them are constitutional. \"We wanted to be part of history,\" said Dee Bush, 40, who received one of the first marriage licences issued to same-sex couples in Birmingham, Alabama. She and her partner of seven years, Laura Bush, quickly wed in a park outside the courthouse. Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice <mark>Roy Moore</mark> had sought to throw up a last-minute roadblock for marriages between gay and lesbian couples. Late Sunday, the socially conservative justice issued an order directing probate judges in his state not to hand out marriage licences to people of the same sex. He said judges were not bound by a federal ruling that last month struck down Alabama's ban on same-sex marriages. US District Court Judge Callie Granade, an appointee of President George W. Bush, ruled in January that Alabama's prohibition on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, but put her decision on hold until Monday. Two of the US Supreme Court's conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, dissented from the court's decision not to further delay gay marriage in Alabama. In a dissenting opinion, Thomas hinted that the court's actions in allowing marriages to go ahead \"may well be seen as a signal of the court's intended resolution of that question.\" In April, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in cases concerning marriage restrictions in Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. A ruling due by the end of June will determine if 13 state bans will remain intact. There has been a legal sea change, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court. It began in June 2013 when the court struck down a federal law that restricted, for the purpose of federal benefits, the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples. Judges around the country later seized on the language in the high court decision, written by swing vote Justice <mark>Anthony Kennedy</mark>, to strike down a series of state bans."}, {"articleID": "2017030410_00905609_W", "names": {"Fu Ying": ["Q1006996", "Q3090487", "Q45377513", "Q45444262", "Q45537139", "Q45541786"]}, "date": "2017-03-04", "url": "http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/world/china-says-defense-budget-rise-about-7-percent-2017", "content": "China says defense budget to rise by about 7 percent in 2017 Published March 4, 2017 - 12:05 am By GERRY SHIH and CHRISTOPHER BODEEN Associated Press BEIJING (AP)--China will raise its defense budget by about 7 percent this year, a government spokeswoman said Saturday, continuing a trend of lowered growth amid a slowing economy. Total defense spending would account for about 1.3 percent of projected gross domestic project in 2017, said <mark>Fu Ying</mark>, spokeswoman for the legislature. She was speaking at a news conference on the eve of the opening of the body's annual session. The precise figure will be provided by Premier Li Keqiang in his address to the National People's Congress on Sunday morning. <mark>Fu</mark> reiterated China's contention that its military was purely for defense and constituted a force for stability in Asia. \"We advocate dialogue for peaceful resolutions, while at the same time, we need to possess the ability to defend our sovereignty and interests,\" <mark>Fu</mark> said. \"The strengthening of Chinese capabilities benefits the preservation of peace and security in this region, and not the opposite.\" Depending on the final figure, this year's budget could mark the third consecutive year of declines in defense spending growth rates. The budget grew by 7.6 percent last year and 10.1 percent in 2015. The increase of about 67 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) would push the total defense budget past the 1 trillion yuan ($145 billion) mark for the first time. The percentage increases do not track in U.S. dollar figures because of variations in the exchange rate. China's defense budget has for years been the world's second largest, although still lagging far behind the U.S. President Donald Trump has asked for a 10 percent increase in U.S. defense spending this year, adding $54 million to the budget that topped $600 billion last year. China points out that, as a developing country with a population of 1.37 billion, its defense spending per capita is a fraction of those of other nations. <mark>Fu</mark> also said the percentage of GDP China spends on defense is below the 2 percent the U.S. calls on NATO allies to spend. \"The gap in capabilities with the U.S. is enormous, but China's military development and construction will continue in keeping with our need to defend our national sovereignty and security,\" <mark>Fu</mark> said. While China insists its military is purely for domestic purposes, it has been spending heavily on technologies allowing it to project power far from shore, including aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and its first overseas military base located in the East Africa nation of Djibouti. Beijing has also come under criticism from the U.S. and others for militarizing man-made islands in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety. <mark>Fu</mark> turned those accusations back on the U.S., saying the strategically vital waterway through which about $5 trillion in trade passes each year was basically calm. \"As to how to the situation develops in future, that depends on U.S. intentions. American actions in the South China Sea have a definite significance in terms of which way the winds blow,\" she said. Rules for posting comments Comments posted below are from readers.

Scout Schultz served as president of the Georgia Tech Pride Alliance, and a leading voice within the campus' LGBTQ community.

That wasn't the case in this movie. So I think that knowing back in the '50s that this was going to be sort of like the template of what an Academy Award-winning movie looked like, it really paved the path.

Garrett: It's funny, with that classic look, even big stars that often aren't known for their class, like Kim Kardashian, have borrowed from Audrey's looks before. That infamous photoshoot she did with the champagne popping over her holding the glass, that is actually inspired by Audrey Hepburn. I'm not sure too many people will notice that. She is the queen of the LBD, the little black dress. She's the one that doesn't show much but makes that look incredibly powerful and, to me, sexy. So, I think that she is a style icon that people borrow from every single day.

RISQU\u00c9 STORIES WRITTEN BY ED WOOD REVEALED DECADES AFTER FILMMAKER'S TRAGIC DEATH Fox News: Just by this film alone, what makes Audrey so different and special? Garrett: I think that Audrey really understood what star power was. I mean in the '50s, you had Clark Gable, Cary Grant--it was always about the men. And then some women really stepped up in the spotlight, like Katharine Hepburn as well as Marilyn Monroe. They realized what star power was all about, and these women [held] their own against their male counterparts. [Audrey] had this demure look, a look that was very, very innocent. But it was a gaze that held so much power.

They didn't know anything about her [but] when she walked in the doors and delivered the lines, they said that on the spot there was no one else. They couldn't envision anything else happening there. She just blew them away.

It is getting from A to B looking as fabulous as possible. Even in that era, the clothes were so perfect. But I think that the fact that it's\" Roman Holiday \"and it is traversing over different coastlines, those holiday-esque looks are just beautiful.

Garrett: The kiss! It's always so funny watching classic movies because they have to be very family-conscious with those sorts of moments. And I always love the fact that it's a very family-friendly moment, but they have a lot of chemistry behind it. [When it comes to classics it's] not usually about getting hot and heavy. It's about the moments that they share, and that's what you have in this film. So when it all comes together, that for me is the cherry on the top.

The announcement on Tuesday came on the back of 13 days of mass protests demanding the departure of the country's entire political elite amid growing anger over official corruption, poor public services and years of economic mismanagement. \"We have reached a deadlock and we need a shock in order to brave through the crisis,\" Hariri said in a televised statement from the capital, Beirut. \"I'm heading to the presidential palace to tender the resignation of the government. This is in response to the will and demand of the thousands of Lebanese demanding change,\" he added. His address came after a group of people loyal to the Shia Hezbollah and Amal movements attacked and destroyed a protest camp set up by anti-government demonstrators in Beirut. <mark>Aoun</mark> could now either accept Hariri's resignation and begin consultations towards forming a new government, or ask him to rethink. It took nine months to form the Hariri coalition cabinet that took office in January. Hariri's resignation defied the powerful Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah has twice said he was against such a step, citing the risk of a dangerous void.
