competition routine associated press writers washington (ap) - rep. sander levin of michigan took over thursday as chairman of the powerful tax-writing house ways and means committee thursday after democrats decided they wanted a consensus builder rather than a firebrand going into the midterm elections. levin, a liberal, replaces rep. charles rangel, d-n.y., who stepped aside wednesday while the house ethics committee continues to investigate his fundraising and finances after concluding last week that he violated house rules forbidding lawmakers from taking trips paid by corporate sponsors. rep. fortney \"pete\" stark, d-calif., was next in line for the post and held it a day, until democrats decided they didn't want one of their most confrontational members - stark once accused republicans of wanting to send troops to iraq \"to get their heads blown off for the amusement of the president\" - in such a high-profile job when their party already is under assault from voters. the ways and means committee is arguably the most powerful and influential in congress. it originates all tax laws and has jurisdiction over trade, social security and benefit programs that pay about half the cost of americans' health care. in choosing levin, democrats went with a soft-spoken leader whom democrats hope will help move them past rangel's ethics problems and provide a steady hand as congress tries to pass a health care bill this month. once health care is addressed, levin will have to turn his attention to billions of dollars in tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year - a thorny issue that will only get more complicated and politically charged as congressional elections approach in november. levin, 78, represents an auto industry district outside detroit and is the democrats' foremost expert on trade, an issue that has been on the back burner since president barack obama took office. he gives up his chairmanship of the ways and means subcommittee on trade to head the full committee. his younger brother by three years, sen. carl levin, also a michigan democrat, is chairman of the senate armed services committee. \"every human being is different,\" levin said of his management style. \"i think what i will try to combine is organization, collegiality and making tough decisions .\" levin said he hopes to work on health care, economic development and job creation. on the latter, obama has wanted more focus on giving businesses tax incentives to increase their payrolls, an approach rejected by many democrats in the house. in his new role, levin could help bridge that gap. but the biggest issue that he and perhaps the entire congress face once health care is out of the way will be the billions in tax cuts initiated by former president george w. bush in 2001 and 2003 that expire at the end of this year. if congress doesn't act, taxes at every income level would increase, with the top income tax rate rising from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. the top capital gains tax rate would rise from 15 percent to 20 percent and the top tax rate on dividends would increase from 15 percent to 39.6 percent. the $1,000 child tax credit would be reduced to $500. \"clearly they have to be addressed, as does the estate tax,\" levin said. \"i think we will continue the middle-class income tax cuts .\" obamahas said he wants to extend most of the tax cuts, allowing taxes to increase only on individuals making more than $200,000 a year and couples making more than $250,000. republicans argue that increasing taxes on high earners would hurt small businesses. democrats on the committee were still trying to get used to levin as chairman on thursday, saying the future was uncertain for big issues like trade and tax reform. \"what we need to do is to take the temperature of what's happened in the committee and at least proceed with some discussions and give the interim chairman some room to make some suggestions,\" said rep. <mark>richard neal</mark> of massachusetts, a senior democrat on the committee. levin, first elected in 1982, is in his 14th term. he will serve as the committee's acting chairman until rangel's ethics case is resolved or a new congress convenes next year. the ethics committee admonished rangel last week for breaking house rules by accepting corporate-financed travel. he has called his exile temporary, but he still faces inquiries over late payment of income taxes on a rental villa he owns in the dominican republic, his use of house stationery to solicit corporate donations to an educational institution that bears his name and belated disclosure of hundreds of thousands of dollars in previously unlisted wealth. rangel, who has said he didn't want his ethics case to damage fellow democrats, said of levin, \"it's the best thing for the country, the congress and the committee under the circumstances. i love him. he's good. he's thorough. he's got a reputation, and he'll do us well .\" levin told reporters: \"i think you know my close relationship with charlie. at this point, i'm acting chairman .\" stark stepped aside thursday, saying he wanted to keep his chairmanship of the ways and means subcommittee on health, a position he would have had to give up if he had taken over the full committee. the chairmanship then fell to levin who is the next most senior democrat. ___ associated press

son of the devil's spawn .\" <mark>david mark</mark>, senior editor for politico, examines rahm emanuel and how he helps and hurts the obama presidency. white house chief of staff rahm emanuel (cbs) (the new republic) noam scheiber is a senior editor of the new republic. allow me to posit a case study: two high-ranking government officials are the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine profiles in the span of a few weeks. the first official resists the attention. he isn't so much as quoted in any of the pieces, whose authors glumly note his lack of enthusiasm for their projects. by contrast, the second official goes out of his way to cooperate with the profile-writers. he submits to numerous, on-the-record interviews and mounts a detailed defense of his actions. his aides even distribute one of the articles after the fact. now, which of these officials would you expect to be pilloried for hogging the spotlight and deflecting blame onto the president? right--me, too. i refer of course to rahm emanuel and tim geithner. since mid-february, emanuel has seen his performance as white house chief of staff dissected in at least four pieces that were, to varying degrees, sympathetic: two in the new york times magazine. similarly, geithner's tenure as treasury secretary is the topic of thousands of words in the current issue of vogue. emanuel is basically a ghost in his pieces-you sometimes think you detect his presence, but it vanishes when you do a double-take. geithner is the central presence in his profiles, delivering lengthy soliloquies on the political economy of financial crises. but whereas geithner's participation is seen as benign, even salutary-virtually everyone in washington (including me) thinks the administration could benefit from a better explanation of its economic successes-emanuel's studious non-participation is held up as evidence of malign intent. \"it sounded, for all the world, like the kind of orchestrated leaks that often precede a forced resignation in washington,\" the wrote of his paper's emanuel stories. \"except that the chief of staff doesn't usually force the president out .\" so, according to this thinking, emanuel has been serving as washington's de facto assignment editor in addition to his other responsibilities. it might all make perfect sense--if it weren't completely nutso. let's not kid ourselves: any time you see a spurt of stories about an operator as prodigious as rahm emanuel, there's reason to think he might be involved. emanuel is \"as relentless in working reporters as he is in working congressmen,\" the times' <mark>peter baker</mark>, who authored one of the profiles, recently told the new yorker. \"he cajoles, lobbies, berates, and trades information because he understands it's better to work with the media than to shut us out .\" suffice it to say, it's hard to believe such a person wouldn't take an interest in his own press clippings. moreover, it would be na\u00efve to assume emanuel wasn't involved in a piece just because he didn't advertise it. as the wall street journal's naftali bendavid notes in the thumpin', his book about emanuel's turn at the house democratic campaign committee (dccc), the chief of staff's longstanding mantra when dealing with reporters is \"no fingerprints .\" bendavid illustrates the approach in the context of several dccc-initiated stories about republicans in the aftermath of hurricane katrina. having said all that, the far more important thing to understand about emanuel is that he has an acutely-honed sense of his own self-interest. which is why he surely knew that drawing attention to himself, and to the ways the president erred by rejecting his advice, would have been a recklessly self-defeating act. all the more so back in february, when the obama administration faced its most turbulent moment yet. this is, after all, one of the most fanatically discreet white house's in recent memory. the average \"west wing\" fan could have told you that airing dirty laundry amid all the scrutiny would completely tick off this president. between this and my own writing about emanuel-a piece i can assure you he didn't initiate, and that i actually started back in december, long before he became washington's chief preoccupation-i'm confident the recent profiles had little to do with any lobbying on the part of their subject. what the pieces mostly had to do with is the fact that emanuel is a compelling figure in his own right. since i published my take last week, a variety of people have privately expressed amazement that emanuel and the white house would allow such a piece to be written. the observation often takes the form of a comparison to a previous chief of staff-something like, \"i can't imagine john podesta or andy card ever going along with a piece like this .\" but, as much as i respect podesta and admire his work for bill clinton, the situation isn't close to analogous. emanuel was a widely known-and much-profiled-figure long before he joined the obama white house; in his own prior life, podesta was a career staffer known only to politicos. there was always going to be a much bigger appetite for rahm emanuel profiles than john podesta profiles. and some fraction of those were going to see the light of day, regardless of how emanuel felt about them. as for the orientation of the recent rahm pieces, that has much more to do with broader media tidal-movements than any intervention by emanuel himself. back in january and early february, a handful of reporters and pundits alleged that emanuel's mistakes as chief of staff were threatening obama's presidency (see here). at that point, a second group of journalists noticed that the anti-rahm narrative, whatever truth it contained, had overshot its <mark>mark</mark>. being opportunistic players in a competitive industry, they (er, we) gambled that some additional reporting and analysis might produce a corrective to the conventional wisdom. better yet, the corrective would have the virtue of being both novel and true! unfortunately, as any economist will tell you, people in a competitive market tend to bid away profits pretty quickly. and so it was that we ended up with not one corrective piece but four. it's not surprising that people like broder--and bloomberg harrumphed about the recent rahm coverage--would read multiple pieces on someone like emanuel and assume they must be orchestrated. these writers came of age in an era when practicing political journalism meant channeling the thoughts of powerful insiders. the main reporting challenge back then was breaking into the establishment-becoming the guy bob strauss or <mark>jim baker</mark> called with a juicy scoop. but the cardinal virtue for this generation's political journalist isn't access; it's counter-intuition. everyone wants to say something surprising, and to generate it by dint of their cleverness and resourcefulness, not at the urging of some wise man they're cultivating. you spend weeks working sources at varying distances from your subject, praying that the scraps of news you collect don't first wind up in the hands of widely-read web reporters like marc ambinder. so you can imagine how it feels when, just as you're pulling it all together, you learn that two or three other journalists have been up to exactly the same thing. actually, you don't have to imagine. i'll tell you: it's kind of annoying. but that's the way the world works. (and, for the record, i wouldn't trade jobs with anybody ...) it's all a little ironic, i guess: as much as we rahm-ologists like to believe we're independent arbiters, our pieces suggest we're only slightly more free-thinking than the establishment journalists of yore. maybe the only difference is that we're chained to a predictable meta-narrative rather than to a particular source. granted, i hope that's not the case. but, if it is, you can hardly blame rahm emanuel. the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. by using this web site you agree to accept our report offensive content: if you believe this comment is offensive or violates the cbsnews.com terms of use, you can report it below (this will not automatically remove the comment). once reported, our staff will be notified and the comment will be reviewed. offensive: sexually explicit or offensive language advertisements, commercial links, or repetitive posts disruptive posting: flaming or offending other users illegal activities: promote cracked software, or other illegal content e-mail this comment to a friend. e-mail this to: send me a copy of this message note: your e-mail address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail and in case of transmission error. neither your address nor the recipients's address will be used for any other purpose. <mark>patrick kennedy</mark>: media doing \"despicable\" job covering afghanistan 7.2-magnitude quake rocks central chile as president sebastian pinera is sworn into office; no immediate reports of injuries angelina jolie films in paris; plus, tom hanks, adrien brody, catherine zeta jones and mo \"nique a glimpse at the day's news as seen through a camera lens this\" er \"actress now plays a\" good wife \"", "articleID": "2010031116_00139536_W", "names": {"David Mark": ["Q16115800", "Q17505469", "Q18159867", "Q459205"], "Jim Baker": ["Q17352688", "Q18764156", "Q6193502", "Q6193507"]}}]
