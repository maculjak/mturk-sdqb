make you hurt and they might even make you dead. the college recruiters, player agents and the public know all about the first but hardly anyone is eager to mention that last bit. every professional team's season highlight video has pictures of happy, healthy athletes, dancing girls and touchdowns, goals and winner's circle celebrations. rarely is the public reminded of the cost--one that can be counted in blood, broken bones and lost dreams. in fact, many of the players don't even understand the ravages that sport can inflict on their bodies. and, even if they do, it's not as if it would suddenly make anyone decide to give up being a quarterback or nascar driver to take up an exciting career in bookkeeping. the center for disease control and prevention estimates that about 300,000 sports-related concussions are suffered each year in the u.s. the average elite athlete will die by age 67, considerably lower than the 76-year life expectancy of the average american. according to the nfl players' association, the average life expectancy of an nfl player is 58 years. \"there's a dramatic difference from the rest of society,\" says stu laird, president of the canadian football league players' association. \"there are some insurance carriers who won't insure them past 51. i've heard figures anywhere from 55 to 59...it's quite dramatic. i wouldn't imagine the cfl to be a lot different in that regard .\" soccer leagues in europe are doing studies that show significant brain damage in players from mid-air collisions and from striking balls with their heads. hockey recently saw the death of don sanderson, a senior player with the whitby dunlops. that is an isolated incident. but serious injuries are not--an nhl player will suffer on average three injuries a season. that can be anything from bruises and lost teeth to herniated discs and concussions. laird understands the dangers and the sacrifices athletes make physically, personally and emotionally. and with team salary caps of $4.2 million for a 40-man cfl roster, nobody is getting rich. the average nfl and cfl career is less than four seasons. but as a 13-year veteran who retired in 1996, laird also understands why <mark>young</mark> athletes will challenge those odds. \"when you're 20, you feel bullet-proof. retirement? getting old? that's 30 years down the road...you don't think that far ahead. i know i wouldn't have given it up for the world. we were having such a good time .\" and, the good times do roll. \"it's glamorous. no doubt a unique lifestyle,\" says toronto maple leafs player development coach paul <mark>dennis</mark>, of the pro lifestyle. \"guys go from making $65-a-week riding the buses from regina to seattle to earning hundreds of thousands of dollars .\" but there is also the reality of eric lindros lying in a crumpled heap with the fairies dancing in his brain. some, such as race-car drivers gilles villeneuve, <mark>greg moore</mark> and dale earnhardt, pay the ultimate price in deadly crashes. jockey avelino gomez's brilliant career ended with a deadly fall at the 1980 canadian oaks. then there are the after-shocks. there is the reality of former cfl lineman <mark>david boone</mark>, found dead on the deck of his home of an apparent suicide. <mark>boone</mark>, who won five grey cup rings with edmonton, suffered from chronic pain and depression believed to have been brought on by haunting football injuries. teammate york hentschel died of organ failure at age 52. another teammate, <mark>bill stevenson</mark>, couldn't escape the bottle. last year, b.c. lions' terry bates broke two vertebrae in his neck and then discovered that the league allowed teams to release injured players and cut their benefits at $60,000 before the next season's training camp. the league's disability plan leaves a bit to be desired. the players hope to improve it in future negotiations with the owners but economics, as always, restricts what the league can do. but money does not heal all wounds. in the nfl, a neuropathologist found that concussions andre waters sustained playing football led to his depression and suicide. former pittsburgh lineman justin strzelczyk was killed in a high-speed police chase. a post-mortem showed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which causes depression and dementia and is usually found in people more than 80 years old. strzelczyk was 36. \"the elite athlete grows up believing he is invincible,\" says sports agent boblamonte. he is also an educator and on the board at new york university. \"they've grown up being the strongest, the best. that invincibility doesn't allow them to see the forest for the trees. you're indestructible. even if they're shown otherwise, they don't see it. it's the classic\" you're not talking about me' syndrome. it's you, and me, and bob, we go into pro sport and we were great in junior high, great in high school, we were great in college and now we're in the pros and it's never going to end. we're the greatest that ever was. \"the adulation, the money and the excitement of pro sports can be intoxicating. today, glenn healy is director of players affairs for the nhl players' association but there is a certain boyish charm to the excitement that comes into his voice when he recalls the 1994 playoffs .\" the challenge, that rush you feel when you're trying to win a championship; i still remember how we felt with the rangers when we stepped on the ice with one game to win in game 7. where are you going to get that? you find me the office anywhere that can match the rush of that experience. you can't. \"it is a high that cannot be diminished by psycho-babble or medical statistics .\" even today, i still miss playing, \"says laird, and he hasn't strapped on the pads in 13 autumns .\" if you look at other sports, baseball, hockey, volleyball, basketball, you can still play the game at a recreational level for a long, long time. but when football is over, you're done. the game just leaves you. there are very few opportunities to stay involved. \"so dallas cowboys quarterback troy aikman hung on through 10 concussions before retiring. san francisco quarterback <mark>steve young</mark> suffered four concussions in three years before he stepped down. in the nhl, mike richter retired only after doctors told him one more concussion might leave him with a lifetime of headaches .\" the game beats you up. you typically don't leave healthy, whether it's a knee, an ankle, a hip. we're like timebombs. we feel good at 35, \"healy says,\" but i'm starting to see guys now who have had hips replaced, knees replaced. you just abuse your body and play when you shouldn't. \"look at <mark>pat quinn</mark>, ken dryden, <mark>colin campbell</mark>, steve yzerman--all had post-career operations. a lot of guys get things done .\" boxing and soccer players are susceptible to many of the same types of injuries. even women's hockey isn't immune. in a study of ncaa sports, women's hockey players were twice as likely to suffer a concussion than their male counterparts. it is the most dangerous female sport, on par with men's soccer. but none compare with pro football. \"in many cases the players are their own worst enemies,\" laird says, \"in the sense that they want to play...to help the team. you don't want to be the person to let down the team and you'll push yourself to extremes. it's such a macho sport...we have to educate people that there could be long-term consequences .\" the anecdotal evidence sometimes seems overwhelming, even when the science is sketchy. the hamilton tiger-cats lost two promising players. defensive back jamaica jackson, 26, died of heart failure last april. offensive lineman travis claridge, 27, died mysteriously in las vegas of \"acute pneumonia, exacerbated by respiratory depression brought on by intoxication with the painkiller oxycodone,\" according to a cbc report. a few years ago, a mental breakdown put barret robbins, the oakland raiders pro bowl centre, in hospital on super bowl sunday. former blue bomber nick benjamin died at 46 of kidney failure, his body so beaten up he had to crawl to the bathroom at night. \"you have to be such an extremely fit individual to play at this level that it is hard to understand why these same guys are so susceptible later,\" laird says. \"how can that be the same person?\" last summer, former tiger-cat receiver leif pettersen, 57, died of a heart attack. former alouettes star tony proudfoot has lou gehrig's disease. sometimes pain becomes familiar and unquestioned. laird says that could explain what happened with his nfl counterpart gene upshaw, who was diagnosed with cancer on a sunday and was dead within the week. \"you just get used to the pain,\" laird says, \"you look at someone like gene...he thought all that pain he felt was because he played 16 years. i'd seen gene in march and noticed he lost weight but he looked great. someone else would've felt that and gone to a doctor .\" the stories tend to be less catastrophic in the nhl, but equally heart-breaking. pat lafontaine and brett lindros lost nhl careers prematurely due to concussions. eric lindros was also forced from the game after too many blows to the head. he is not going gently into the dark. \"you have big strong men, there's going to be high impact. inevitably concussions will occur. that being said, the respect level of our game has diminished so much that it has never been this low,\" says eric, who recently stepped down as an ombudsman with the players' association. the average nhl career is over in less than five years. and, while not everyone leaves on a stretcher, it doesn't minimize the hurt. \"i'd hate to see these goaltenders today who go down on every shot. i'd hate to think what their knees and hips are going to be like at 60,\" healy says. still, leave it to a puck warrior to find some levity amidst the ruins. \"you shake hands with johnny bower and you think:\" are those feet or hands?' he's broken every finger. they are, \"says healy, chuckling,\" enormous: like oktoberfest sausages. \"--the disabled list the following are examples of competitors who were severely injured while competing in their chosen sports.in some cases the injuries were career-ending or fatal. former buffalo sabres goaltender clint malarchuk bleeds profusely after his carotid artery was severed by the skate of st. louis blues' steve tuttle during a collision on march 22, 1989, in buffalo. more than 300 stitches were required to close the wound. florida panthers foward richard zednik, centre, is helped from the ice after his carotid artery was accidentally cut by the skate of teammate <mark>olli jokinen</mark> feb. 10, 2008, coincidentallyin buffalo. auto racing is inherently dangerous. many drivers have suffered serious injury or died as a result of crashes over the years. but few as high profile as seven-time nascar champion dale earnhardt sr. earnhardt was killed when he suffered a basilar skull fracture among other injuries in a last-lap crash during the 2001 daytona 500. earnhardt's death was the catalyst for various safety improvements in nascar. former buffalo bills tight end kevin everett is tended to by emergency personnel after sustaining a fracture and dislocation of his cervical spine during an nfl game in 2007. everett was temporarily paralyzed, but fortunately regained the ability to walk. he never played another game in the nfl. some other former nfl players to suffer serious neck injuries include mike utley (detroit lions, 1991), <mark>dennis byrd</mark> (new york jets, 1992) and mack strong (seattle seahawks, 2005). published by sun

49ers have a shot at stealing a potential hall of fame quarterback away from their chief rival. it could work. obviously, the 49ers have a desire to sign him, and they have $26 million of cap space in which to do it. if that does happen, offensive coordinator and head coach <mark>mike singletary</mark> would be smart to redress their offense into a form which suits warner, which means more passing, more multi-receiver sets, more shotgun formations. kurt warner doing what he does best. it doesn't mean the 49ers can't have a potent running attack, but to not take advantage of warner's skills would be to greatly miss an opportunity. but here's the other question, does the personnel the 49ers have suit warner? consider when he was at his best in st. louis and arizona, he teamed with the best receiving corps in the game at the time. when warner was with the giants relatively pedestrian receivers, he struggled. also, warner has said the reason he was so dynamic this past season was because he knew the offense. if warner has to go through a steep learning curve, expect the new <mark>york</mark> giants' warner, the guy who throws interceptions, gets sacked and fumbles. that's why it's so crucial that the 49ers approximate the offense of former arizona offensive coordinator todd haley if they can pull off the coup of signing him. email) | march 02 2009 at 10:35 am this story is great blog material but other than that...a complete waste of everyone's time. they should be spending the money on a hard hitting safety like jermaine phillips and a tackle like khalif barnes which both play into <mark>singletary</mark>'s defense first, smash mouth attack. then get a pash rusher in the draft unless they can trade back, get more picks and still pick up sanchez or stafford if they fall in the draft. kurt-o-claus is coming to town! i read somewhere that this kind of move indicates jed york is showing a new, more aggressive style of ownership! this will at least force the tards to up the offer to warner and eat cap space! good for jed! jimmy raye's best quality as a coach is finding a way to use his players the best way! he will be able to get warner going here too! no way warner signs here. he's a poor fit and really not what the niners need right now. this would certainly fall under the \"holy sheepsh! t' heading of fa signings. - go slim pickens!!! - it would be a stop-gap signing, but it would get them pretty far in the west this year. if they did do this, they would then have to address their line immediately. sign barnes and/or someone else (runyan? pace?) and draft a couple more guys. they could still go after e brown in the 1st round, but the 2nd and 4th round picks would have to be ots and maybe my guy from slo in the 3rd round - ramses. i would be crazy to say that bringing in kurt warner would be a bad thing. but i really like what we've got going with shaun and the power running philosophy that the niners are trying to implement. we finally have a coach who has a system in place that he wants to run for years to come. and to change that structure because of one player is risky. i say stick with what you have and bolster that defense and o-line through the draft. instead of kurt warner visiting, the 49ers should be getting <mark>jay cutler</mark> on the phone. apparently he can be had for a first. now your talkin primafacie! is there really evidence of that? we should jump on it! <mark>jay cutler</mark> is angry with the fiasco over the weekend when a three-way between denver, tampa bay and new england falling apart. it would have put matt cassell with the broncos, <mark>cutler</mark> in tampa and a first with the patriots. . buying opportunity. . i don't think signing warner would be a coup, especially at the price he'll command. as <mark>keith</mark> points out, he had very pedestrian years when he was throwing to average receivers. and do we really thing that johnny raye will be able to\" approximate \"todd haley's offense, even if <mark>mike singletary</mark> gave him the ok? aw man you had me excited but. ., we don't want to trade <mark>jay</mark>,\" mcdaniels said saturday. \"we never did. he's our quarterback .\" ...that was a compilcated deal, i don't think we can put together a package like that. mcdaniels was after cassell his ex qb...pmh9erfan...jimmy raye would be able to get the most out of having warner if we did get him!. why shell out all of that dough for a guy who will play one, maybe two seasons for us and be gone. . i could see why the jets did it...it was favre. . warner is no favre!. bad move imo.... posted by: kauairobert | march 02 2009 at 11:29 am regardless of what kurt warner did last season and when he was with the rams i have little to no faith in him as a football player and least of all as a quarterback. in both situations where he won he had the most ridiculous wide recievers in the game which took most if not all the pressure off of him at the qb position. he's an arena league qb parading as an nfl qb because when he succeeds all he has had to do is throw the ball deep and the amazing recievers just go get it. he can't scramble, he still holds the ball too long, and we want to run a power running offense. he doesn't fit the 49ers offensive plans, our offensive personnel doesn't fit warner and frankly <mark>singletary</mark> and warner together would be way too much god talk for the bay area. it's a step backwards for the 49ers who should be looking more at development of a qb than a has been who was never really a qb in the true definition of the word. they should be pressing denver hard for <mark>cutler</mark>. the pats already set the market at a 2nd round pick. hey <mark>kevin</mark> do we have to sign warner's wife to a contract too since she's the leader of the household and spokes woman for the warner family? - what a pathetic ownership we have here, it started from the automatic hiring of <mark>singletary</mark> with his 5-4 pristine record and without bothering to look at what was available, the hiring of raye and now warner. this ownership are not only a bunch of tight wod's but are clueless on how to run a winning nfl franchise properly. - but hey they're very lucky to have <mark>kevin lynch</mark> as their ambassador of spineless reporting and a whole lot of fans like unca_chuck who accept anything and just move on. if they were doing a reality show to see how far and gullible fans can be taken for a ride by their teams ownership then i'd understand but this is insanity and should be considered a crime. i'd be willing to bet that warner is in \"get paid\" mode. the cards rejected him and told him he wasn't worth 12-15 million a year. he thinks he is, and with all the wasted millions the niners throw around (see most recent signing), why not throw another couple mill at warner to get lienert prematurely playing, fitz frustrated, and the d's stacking the box against the cards' newly acquired running backs (in this year's draft). it's a win / win anyway you slice it, but this group of dumbies will screw it up six ways from sunday. pay warner a lot o' dough!!!! well, i'll be damned. if this comes to fruition, i'll have to come up with some new grocery clerk material. it won't be easy, but i'll do it. you guys can count on me. . good post bra!...~ aloha ~ here's a funny one...i was on the broncos website looking for <mark>cutler</mark> news...they have a picture of nolan up there hahahahahahahahaha if a qb is all this team needed to compete and win a championship, this would be the greatest day ever. but we need to be able to keep him upright and play solid d. i don't think we are there yet and would rather see ol and db addressed before we worry about a qb. hill will be just fine this year. we can address the qb \"need\" after the season when the rest are covered. in my opinion. - that is of course, unless they plan on bringing in an actual wr like tj...brmgd30! good post! there are actually people on here who think we should sign warner and draft a querterback with our #1 pick!!!! sheeesh...we might as well put 5 offensive tackles and 4 quarterbacks on the field every play! hey kauai! i agree, \"warner is no favre!\" but something tells me, both will end up in canton someday. bring back joe and steve! i'm always looking for conspiracies. i can't help but believe the rumors about vick, warner coming in, are for shaun hill. maybe sing wants to scare the pants off of him (so to speak) to become a true full season 1st string qb. maybe he's trying to soften the blow of kicking hill back to 2nd string (with <mark>alex</mark>, with <mark>cutler</mark>?). maybe he's setting the stage for getting sanchez. maybe it's just jerking the cards. i sure enjoy speculating...warner is in the niners complex now! he took a physical and is talking to our guys now! oh, that's what that lear jet flying over my house this morning was. i thought it was larry ellison again. no, no, no, no! did i fall asleep and wake up and the niners had an excellent, deep, wide receiver corps? and get a successful pass-blocking ol? kiss off rebuilding the lines if you sign warner. at least we know why scotty didn't splurge on fa so far. i just * hope * he's playing poker and raising the stakes for the cards. puh-lease...the biggest mistake the 49ers made was not going after gm scott pioli the braintrust of the new england patriots.now he's on his way to making the chiefs respectable again getting cassel for a 2d round pick a brillant move.does anyone think mcclueless could pull that off with <mark>jay cutler</mark> and denver? jayson <mark>taylor</mark> is now available for $8.5 mil. screw kurt warner (no offense, future hof), and take <mark>alex</mark> with you...warner as the starter with hill as his backup would be far better than hill with <mark>smith</mark>... (heaven forbid a <mark>smith</mark> with hill scenario). with warner, vd wouldn't have to catch with his fingers wide or low anymore, one of his key weaknesses as a pass catcher, because warner can hit him on the numbers every time. we haven't anybody with his kind of accuracy since joe and steve. the only problem would be that vd would be doing too much strutting around with his new found \"ability\". and then we could still draft e. brown (or sanchez as an apprentice qb if brown is gone) with the first pick. after looking it up, maybe <mark>jason</mark> is more interested in dancing now than his 6 pro-bowl appearances as a pass-rushing de. sing would change that in a hurry. reno, big, where are you? would he fit into a 3-4, or am i just blowing $8.5 mil worth of smoke again? \"we don't want to trade <mark>jay</mark>,\" mcdaniels said saturday. \"we never did. he's our quarterback .\". you believe him? josh mcdaniels was ready to dump <mark>jay cutler</mark> for matt cassell, which says how highly he thinks of <mark>cutler</mark>. sez here next year's no. 1 does it. here's my two cent opinion that i posted on the last thread. i just don't see warner on our team. i guess if we picked up holt, pace, and with bruce we could be the geriatric greatest show on grass. god, please don't let that happen. news flash - i just got off the phoe with a bud from high school. he let me know that the the most popular sporting goods store we used to shop at is being bought by dicks sporting goods. the place used to be called chick's. no word on whether it will now be called chicks with dicks! pursuing and then signing warner would have made all the sense in the world - if we still had martz. as is, i find the news tepid. i don't mind that martz is gone but hell, i would mind if we get warner and now no more martz to pair him up with. reno, what about <mark>jason taylor</mark>? this question's right up your alley, my good friend...the warner signing is great from two angles...first we get a great qb and stiff the cards and...wait for it...finally dump <mark>alex</mark> smiths 13 mill a contract for warners 13 mill a year contract so we break even and still have all the cap space to blow on another failure of a signing hey sidewinder - \"the greatest geriactic show on grass .\" that's good turf! add that, to my broken left hip. now we're talking! just you wait, i'm gonna beat next year in our fantasy football league. if i make it that long...i like <mark>jason</mark> tylor but don't know what he has left. i really don't know what to think. i'd be inclined to think he's not worth 8.5 mil. i also think if he is worth it mcsing will be calling. - i must get back to work but the chicks with dicks story is true. hey reno - chicks with dicks? you gave me the wrong 900 number again. posted by: del_mar_dennis | march 02 2009 at 01:51 pm reno, there used to be a biker bar about 5 miles from here on the road to my favorite city in the world, los gatos. played pool there - badly, but i wasn't a biker. sold, turned into a gay bar named \"friends\". never went there. didn't last long, i think bikers from all over the west kept showing up...jake2007 - if the 9ers do pick up warner, i certainly don't see them drafting a qb in the 1st round. a qb selected with the 10th pick would be earning as much as most starters in the league. as a reference point, joe flacco was taken 18th overall and got a 5-year, $30m deal. that's in 2008. you have to believe a guy like sanchez taken at #10 in 2009 would command something in the $7 - $8m range. combine that with the $14m/yr warner wants and the $2m/yr they're paying hill and you have the world's most expensive stable of quarterbacks. that said, maybe they'll spend a second day pick on a guy who won't wring them dry. hey reno - if you could promise me this, i'll make it up by draft day. *** if they do somehow end up with warner, the timimg would be awful screwy seeing as how martz left the building a while ago. would it mean we'd go after holt and pace? posted by: unca_chuck | march 02 2009 at 02:15 pm hey dennis - you'll make it. and i am sure it will be just a fun as last year. this is some crazy stuff with warner though. - asmith - like you said, if we could just flip-flop <mark>smith</mark> and warner's expected salary, so we could kick <mark>smith</mark> to the curb, without it costing too much, i'm all for it. - what in the wide wide world of sports is a goin on here?...where's the white women?...and where the hell are vernon \"aint gonna do ya no good no how\" davis's trade papers at? - kurt warner huh?...drop <mark>alex</mark> and give the $'s to kurt instead for two years, also screwing our \"newest\" division rival?...sounds good in theory so far:)... then we draft a qb somewhere on the third round to take the reigns over when warner's gone?...where does hill fit in? - he'd have to change his number out of respect to mr. warner:)... be his back-up...hmmmm...something will go wrong, sing might drop trow in front of kurts wife or something during the \"meeting\" - how'd you like that ass whoopin i put on ya in the nascar del:) - and p.s., why not take a flyer on <mark>jason taylor</mark>, seeing as we're not signing any ot's in free agency.... guess they like jennings? the entire charade about warner goes to show how unsettled <mark>singletary</mark> is on our back-up passing as a starter s. hill. let the ridculous <mark>alex smith</mark> go. pleeeze. go get <mark>cutler</mark>. he is lightyears better than any qb in this mediocre draft. if warner is signed look for bruce to stay!:) wow, v. a new record. your 12,983,036 post saying the same thing. - are you as tired of typing this sh! t as we are of reading it? apparently not. get a life. better yet, get a job. hey \"faithful! that's what i've been trying to tell these people...\"my name is jim, but most people call me...jim\" maybe you should eat something, first? \"no thanks. food makes me sick .\" \"a man drink like that, and he don't eat, he's gonna die .\" \"when?\" posted by: del_mar_dennis | march 02 2009 at 03:12 pm arizona today signed <mark>keith lewis</mark>. seems like a fair trade: <mark>lewis</mark> for kurt warner. damn chuck, was just thinking that v pretty much copy's and paste's his blogs:) - but \"v\" , you and i have had our words, just a couple of times...you seem to be bright, and yet you still are caught up in the past? - don't you \"feel\" something familiar with jed debartolo pulling the strings now? - yep, i said it...he's not <mark>john york</mark>! - a <mark>york</mark>, would not have the balls to send a private jet to phoenix to pick up kurt and the little mrs., then drive them around in a stretch limo to and from headquarters, the hostpital, etc. - it's a debartolo move...one his uncle eddy was famous for:)... the kids got balls, the want to win, he actually seems like he doesn't like losing (uncle eddy perhaps?) - he's going after a hall of fame qb (yes, he was a ram at one time) who i am sure you would rather have the ball in his gloved hands than anyone we've put out on the field since garcia right? - flow with it my guitar wielding friend, stop with the constant whining of the past, the yorks, nolan...this could be our division again!!!! - or, we could just be sheep being led down the yorks fiery path to hell:) - i got my $on little jed debartolo, seeing that he seems to have more of that blood running through his veins, than his no football knowing dr. daddy! - he aint acting like a <mark>york</mark>!!!!.... just sayin...but he also hasn't traded away vernon \"brickhouse\" davis yet either:)... so six in one hand, half dozen in the other...but it'd be nice to know warner was under center for the next two years, instead of doing another deal for the inaccurate <mark>smith</mark> right? move for the niners. last year he had the best receivers in the league and excellent protection--the niners would give him neither and he would be his old fumbling self. the only reason his signing is possible is because the niners are so stupid!!! jed and mcclueless--what a team--i pray to the most high that sf does not sign warner. three negatives: 1. we don't have the personal at wr. 2. we got rid of m. martz, which warner would be able to excel under. 3. we can't protect him, he's not mobile at all. thanks for the visit and then get lost kurt. the only reason dr. <mark>york</mark> was involved in the nfl at all was because of a couple incidents. eddie d. got booted out of league for his felony involvement southern gambling casinos (i don't remember, riverboat?). his sister denise took over. denise was clueless, but sure wasn't going to give up a $1 billion business that eddie made so much money on over the years. denise is married to dr. <mark>york</mark>. he has been running the team for years. we've seen how that's gone. jed's running the team now. with sing as hc. 391 king street west chatham ontario n7m 1g3 canada barefeet possess barefeet pictures of kurt warner posted by: bigred55a | march 02 2009 at 04:17 pm true, warner is no favre. favre only played in one super bowl, and sabotaged two teams on his way out to pasture. if kurt warner wants to be a 49er...sign him up!!!!! why would any team pass on kurt warner? he's one of the best in the nfl!!! why not? it's irresponsible not to. kurt warner can adjust to any offense and its personnel. he's a professional football player for christ's sake. we paid <mark>alex smith</mark> all that money for absolutely nothing!!!!! kurt warner is no <mark>alex smith</mark>. why any 49er fan would settle for the qb's we have already is beyond me. i want to win now. kurt warner gives us the best chance to win now...after the past 7-8 years why we want to postpone winning now for the future doesn't make any sense at all. gooooo kurt warner. and referencing his stint with the giants.... and when he first signed with arizona...his mechanics were changed...and he did what he had to do to be successful in this league...<mark>alex smith</mark> could learn from that. if it takes $14 million per to sign kurt warner, wouldn't that money be better spent on, say, <mark>jay cutler</mark>, a guy to build around? a 37 -, 38-year-old quarterback could go at any minute. chuck, actually the warner topic was just brought up only a few days ago and about you being a spineless, gutless and accepting everything and just moving on, i will continue to bring it up until you stop your puppet dangling ways. - faithful, the <mark>york</mark>'s hiring of <mark>singletary</mark>, raye and now warner happen not that long ago so please don't make it seem like i been talking about warner for years. with that said going after warner who's one hit away from being in a wheel chair isn't what i call a great free agent prospect and it's one out of many bad moves the <mark>york</mark>'s have made since their arrival. again if this happened to be a reality show the <mark>york</mark>'s were putting on to see how far they can take all the gullible 49ers fans for a ride before they said enough is enough well then i would understand. it's obvious it won't work with fans like you and unca_chuck because like v said before you'll accept anything including an all female 49ers team, flag football and much, much more and will never complain and will always have a smile. - when the last time the <mark>york</mark>'s went after a real free agent signing instead of the bottom of the barrel prospects? tell me i'm waiting...what bruce another person who's one hit away from being in a wheel chair himself. do you see a real winning organization like the patriots going after these bottom of the barrel players? no it's only the 49ers who are trying to penny pinch their way to a championship and in reality it doesn't work that way. what happened to you fans has your expectations falling so low that anything is better than nothing? an 8-8 season is your super bowl championship. has it got just that bad that your really don't expect much out of your team and any progress is better than none? these little moves and trades made by this pathetic ownership with the hopes it will lead us to a super bowl victory is pure insanity and you fans that buy into this nonsense and move on with balles chuck and his white flag of surrender is the real problem we face in america today. _ chuck, for v saying things as they really are and bringing out the truth i would prefer you calling me a raider fan or a nazi like most liberals do when they don't want to hear a mans point of view. \"favre only played in one super bowl...\"yeah, i know...would've edited if i could've. malcolm jenkins - 1st round ohio state don't get me wrong, i could live with raji. with <mark>taylor</mark>, you don't need brown. i want a safety. <mark>taylor</mark> gives an edge pass-rusher (from a 4-3)?. still doesn't solve the problem at nt, but, heck, it's just an idea. prima...with all due respect...warner only costs the 49ers money...it's not my money so i could care less really. <mark>cutler</mark> on the other hand will cost draft picks...we can't afford that at this stage of our\" progress \". and why would denver shop <mark>cutler</mark> anyway??? what have they observed that\" we \"haven't?? why do people keep bringing up <mark>cutler</mark>? that was always a 3-way deal that would reunite josh mcdaniels with cassell. the broncos were only willing to trade a franchise qb for a franchise qb. not to mention the fact that shaun hill has a better winning percentage than <mark>cutler</mark> (who i believe has more losses than wins as a starter). <mark>cutler</mark> is definitely not gonna happen and warner's a waste of money. could this possibly be a way for warner to leverage the cards for more money while we scare <mark>alex smith</mark> into giving us a lower restructured deal? in the end, t.j. houshmandzadeh's free-agency fling ended where it started: with the seahawks. houshmandzadeh, the top-rated receiver in free agency, decided monday afternoon to sign with the seahawks. the deal was first reported by espn.com, sighting multiple sources, and has been confirmed by the p-i. houshmandzadeh, who also was being wooed by the minnesota vikings and had an offer to re-sign with the cincinnati bengals, will sign what is believed to be a five-year, $40 million contract that includes $15 in guarantees. renoberger you killed me!!!!!!!!! i read the it's official he signed and...this time it's a player leaving the 49ers. defensive lineman ronald fields has signed a two-year, $5 million contract with the denver broncos, espn is reporting ....oh nobrain strikes again! now he can make fields look even less effective than he really is!", "articleID": "2009030301_00026815_W", "names": {"Alex Smith": ["Q12720234", "Q16658140", "Q20011588", "Q2833039", "Q4717806", "Q4717807", "Q4717808", "Q4717809", "Q4717810", "Q4717811", "Q4717812", "Q4717814", "Q4717815", "Q4717818", "Q4717819", "Q57417658", "Q717897"], "Jason Taylor": ["Q16213806", "Q1684006", "Q24738395", "Q2786087", "Q6163606", "Q6163608"], "Jay Cutler": ["Q312811", "Q937778"]}}]
