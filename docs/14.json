Rashme Sehgal reports for Rediff.com on how fires are blazing across Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and have reached the doorstep of Himachal Pradesh's capital city Shimla. The Himalayas have turned into a veritable inferno. Fires are blazing across Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and have reached the doorstep of Himachal Pradesh's capital city Shimla. The rare oak forest stretching from the verdant hills of Mashobra to Anandpur in Himachal are ablaze and though desperate municipal corporation officials of Shimla have pressed the fire brigade into service, acute water scarcity has rendered the fire tenders ineffective .\" I brought my family to Shimla for a vacation. We came here to escape the heat of the plains and now we find ourselves trapped in this situation made worse by the erratic wind patterns and rising temperatures, \"says chartered accountant Harish Malhotra who had booked himself and his family into a hotel in Anandpur facing Shimla. The situation is even worse in Uttarakhand where the Char Dham Yatra is at its peak between the months of April to end June when the rains start. This year, lack of winter rains had seen forest fires start as early as the month of February. The state administration's failure to take effective action has seen this wall of fire stretch from Rudraprayag, Pauri, Almora, Chamoli, Nainital, Chakrata and Dehra Dun districts. The situation is so alarming that these fires have stretched to the sparsely populate remote hill areas which lack accessibility and where the local population is not in a position to tackle such a major fire. A thick pall of smog has spread across these districts right down to Rishikesh frightening thousands of tourists who are in the process of cancelling their visit to the shrines of Badrinath and Kedarnath right up to Gaurinath. Tour operators warn of heavy cancellations by tourists triggered by reports of the devastating fires .\" These forest fires are bound to impact tourism at a time when we were hoping that we would see a much larger footfall, \"says C Ravishankar, managing director, Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam which oversees tourism in this state. Already, over 3,000 hectares of pristine forest comprising deodars, chir trees and oak have been destroyed. Along with this, an entire eco-system of rare medicinal plants have been lost. The impact of these fires will be felt on the fragile water systems of these hills which provide the catchment area for all our major rivers. If this was not enough bad news, the forest department of Jammu and Kashmir has confirmed that the fires have spread to the state's Rajouri district with fires having erupted in and around Bathuni and Gambhir areas. With no chief minister to take responsibility for the situation, Uttarakhand Governor K K Paul has reviewed the rescue efforts through video conferencing with officials in the field. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who is also in charge of forests, told the media on Sunday that the Centre and he were taking the issue of controlling these fires\" very seriously .' \"Over 6,000 people are presently deployed fighting these fires. We have also granted Rs 5 crore (Rs 50 million) to the state,' said Javdekar who had not visited the areas at the time of filing this report. The environment ministry also started trial runs Sunday for a pre-fire alert system that will issue warnings via SMS regarding the location of a fire to every state government, the Met department and other concerned organisations. Javadekar also pointed out that the Union government would study the reasons behind such major fires and prepare an action plan on how to control such fires in the future. The home ministry has deployed three National Disaster Response Force contingents, army jawans and officers and two Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopters to help douse the fires, but the thick layer of smog is causing a major visibility problem not allowing the choppers to function. Ecologist Dr Yogesh Gokhale of The Energy and Resources Institute believes the state governments have failed to follow simple management practices including the cleaning up of the forest floors of the accumulated pine needles. This, Dr Gokhale pointed out, is highly combustible material and if it had been cleared by the local people themselves, this problem would not have arisen. These pines can be used for a variety of purposes including preparing biomass briquettes and so provide an incentive for the local people to use them. Dr <mark>Anil Joshi</mark>, who heads the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organisation, believes the time has come to revoke the Forest Conservation Act 1980 .\" Earlier, the local communities in a spirit of collective responsibility were in the forefront of controlling the fires, \"Dr <mark>Joshi</mark> said .\" This was because they had a stake in the forests. But after the passing of this Act, the forests have been handed over to the ministry of environment and forests, thereby not allowing the local people to enter these reserved forests. \"The MoEF, Dr <mark>Joshi</mark> maintained, lacks the resources to handle the situation on the ground .\" Under the present regime, there is a forest guard posted after every 80 km and there is also a fire watcher who issues an alert in case of a fire. But the local guys hired to be fire watchers in 2015 have not been paid their emoluments to date, so what motivation would they have to give alerts or to put out the fire? \"Dr <mark>Joshi</mark> did concede that the cause of these devastating forest fires could be the handiwork of either the timber mafia or the lack of rain during two successive winters, which have resulted in a lack of moisture both in the soil and in the air. Environmentalists agree about the role of the timber mafia. Uttarakhand's Forest Development Corporation is entitled to auction trees which have dried up or are dead .\" They now have crores worth of dried trees which can be auctioned and from which they can earn a lot of money, \"an environmentalist pointed out on condition of anonymity .\" This huge fire shows a complete lack of preparedness on the part of the administration who should have played a much more pro-active role, \"felt Dr Ravi Chopra, director, Dehra Dun People's Institute .\" Till 30 years ago, \"he added,\" there was an intense relationship between the community and the forest land. Today the alienation is so high that I have seen villagers living at the edge of a forest who will make no effort to douse a fire. They say the land belongs to the forest department so let them put out the fire. \"\"We need to get local communities involved with forests as was the case 150 years ago,\" Dr Chopra said. Peter Smetacek, the Bhimtal-based lepidopterist who is a member of the Uttarakhand State Wildlife Advisory Board, has warned that these fires would have destroyed an entire ecosystem of insects, butterflies, reptiles and thousands of larger animals. \"In 2009,\" Smetacek said, \"we were witness to a major fire and it took two to three years for the population of insects and butterflies to recover. But this time, the situation is much worse and this will have terrible consequences because we all belong to one ecosystem .\" Dr Chopra pointed out how in 1991, he along with other environmentalists had calculated the worth of a forest in Jharkhand. \"We found that the net present value of a typical tree was between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. And this did not include the worth of its timber. Today, the cost of each tree in these forests would have multiplied several fold so the losses caused by this fire run into thousands of crores of rupees .\" \"Even worse is that this fire will result in the soil becoming very dry. Climate change is resulting in fewer spells of heavier rainfall which will see huge amounts of soil erosion,\" Dr Chopra added. \"All this eroded soil is going to end up in our rivers and dams,\" he warned. \"This will reduce the life span of our dams including the Tehri Dam. The kind of losses the nation is facing are incalculable .\" "}, {"articleID": "2018061122_00154473_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Marco Antonio Rubio": ["Q324546", "Q3845892"]}, "date": "2018-06-11", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/391720-deal-to-include-zte-penalties-in-must-pass-defense-bill", "content": "\u00a9 Greg Nash Senators announced Monday that legislation keeping in place penalties against Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE will be included in a must-pass defense policy bill. \"By including this provision to undo the ZTE deal in the defense bill, the Senate is saying loudly and in a bipartisan fashion that the president is dead wrong to back off on ZTE,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer Dem leaders condemn <mark>Trump</mark> after reversal on G-7 communique endorsement Dem lawmaker: <mark>Trump</mark> conceding \"role as leader of the free world' after G-7 summit Schumer: <mark>Trump</mark>\" turning our foreign policy into an international joke' MORE (D-N.Y.), a supporter of the amendment, said in a statement.

Trucks sat in with Phish for their encore on two blues-rock songs from their catalog, including former guitarist Jeff Holdsworth's\" Possum \"and Son Seals'\" Funky Bitch. \"Anastasio's three bandmates had already shared the stage with Trucks during the previous two years. As time went on, both guitarists' projects evolved, with Anastasio expanding his outfit into the orchestra-size Trey Anastasio Band and Trucks partnering with his wife, Susan Tedeschi, to form the similarly soulful and horn-abetted Tedeschi Trucks Band. The musicians have shared the stage a few times over the past two decades--mostly with the Allman Brothers Band, though Trucks guested with TAB in 2002, and Anastasio returned the favor at New York's Beacon Theatre in 2017. But it wasn't until last night that the two musicians shared the stage for a full set (for which they spent multiple days rehearsing). Trucks blended in seamlessly with the Trey Anastasio Band from the start of their second set, using his trademark slide skills to color the group's layered arrangements and take a number of well-placed solos. Their joint performance opened with two relatively new Anastasio compositions that Phish has also embraced,\" Set Your Soul Free \"and\" Everything's Right, \"and then shifted to three Phish originals Anastasio has added to TAB's canon since rebooting the group last year after a short break:\" Camel Walk, \"\"Ghost\" and \"Blaze On .\" Both \"Camel Walk\" and \"Ghost\" served as perfect vehicles for Trucks, who accented the former song's bluesy roots and added a new, spooky feeling to the latter Story of the Ghost gem. (Interestingly, Trucks has now joined Anastasio for both of Holdsworth's lasting contributions to the Phish repertoire .) As he continued to find his way around TAB's full sound, Trucks shined on the meditative \"Dark and Down\" and the Phish-adopted groove-vehicle \"Sand .\" Though she was not originally billed as part of today's lineup, Susan Tedeschi emerged as the song came to a close to sing on a tender moment from Anastasio's Ghosts of the Forest project, \"A Life Beyond the Dream,\" and another tune that hugs the Phish and TAB worlds, \"Rise Up/Come Together .\" Finally, Anastasio, Trucks and the members of TAB closed the main portion of their show with the high-energy rave-up \"Push On\" Til the Day. \"Another element Anastasio has added to his TAB shows with more frequency since touring as a solo act in recent years is an unplugged encore segment. Last night, the guitarists returned for acoustic duets with Trucks on the Ghosts of the Forest number\" Brief Time \"and a newer Phish song that has recently grown into a dependable rocker,\" More. \"Most of TAB then returned for another Phish favorite,\" 46 Days, \"and Anastasio's horns slid back onstage for the classic show-closing celebration\" First Tube. \"The day's main-stage musical offerings kicked off over 12 hours earlier with Rockin' to Lockn' winner, Washington, DC's Surprise Attack, who offered a high-energy set of their trademark\" Mountain funk. \"(Elsewhere onsite, it has already been an eventful day: <mark>Joe Russo</mark> emerged during recent recording partners Circles Around the Sun's late-night show in Garcia's Forest around 2:45 am, and about eight hours later the Doobie Decibel Duo held court on the Pianos on the Porch nook .) Soon after, the New York--based <mark>Greg Humphreys</mark> Electric Trio, whose namesake has deep ties to the improvisational world through his previous projects Dillon Fence and Hobex, provided the day's first interlocking set when they kicked off their performance while circling toward the audience on the venue's rotating stage. Lockn' has built its reputation on its unique collaborative performances and, after the trio's set, Moonalice offered the first of several special\" Lockn' moments, \"welcoming the sweet-voiced T Sisters and legendary soul singer Lester Chambers and his son Dylan at various points during their performance. The T Sisters shined on a swirl of the Grateful Dead's\" Uncle John's Band, \"\"Bird Song\" and \"Attics of My Life,\" while Lester and Dylan helped Moonalice and the singers close their set with two songs long associated with The Chamber Brothers, \"People Get Ready\" and \"Time Has Come Today .\" Unfortunately, after the ensemble's set, the concert field was cleared temporally as the second storm of the weekend passed through the area. Music resumed after a short delay, although a few acts ended up playing slightly truncated sets to help put things back on schedule. Melvin Seal & JGB and their current featured guitarist, Furthur's John Kadlecik, welcomed fans back with a set comprised mostly of classics from the Jerry Garcia Band songbook, kicking off with staples like \"Cats Under the Stars,\" \"Run for the Roses\" and an appropriate \"Mission in the Rain .\" Their set came to a close with a Garcia-Robert Hunter tune from outside the traditional JGB well, \"Eyes of the World,\" before turning over the stage to the recently reunited Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. <mark>Bob Weir</mark> and Edie Brickell photo by Dean Budnick Brickell has a long history with the Dead world, having collaborated with Garcia and opened for the Dead, but it's been a while since she has been on the jam circuit. Yet, at the end of their performance, Brickell & New Bohemians brought out <mark>Bob Weir</mark> for a choice take on \"Deep Elem Blues,\" marking his first appearance with the group. (Earlier this month, <mark>Weir</mark> sat in with Brickell's husband, <mark>Paul Simon</mark>, at San Francisco's Outside Lands and TAB percussionist Cyro Baptista has been part of his band. Though he did not perform, <mark>Simon</mark> was on hand for his wife's performance .) Form there, the rest of the evening's focus shifted to some of the leading lights of the modern jamband and roots scenes, beginning with funky Mid-Atlantic favorites Pigeons Playing Ping Pong. The quartet, who were energized by their enthusiastic crowd, ran through \"High As Five,\" \"Porcupine\" and a segue from \"Somethin\u2019 For Ya\" into \"Julia,\" before bringing out their previously announced guest, Vulfpeck associate Cory Wong, for \"Lightning .\" Soon after, The Revivalists horn section joined the members of Pigeons Playing Ping Pong for a run from \"FU\" into Prince's \"1999,\" before returning to \"FU,\" before PPPP closed their show by themselves with \"The Liquid .\" The group also took the opportunity to announce two big December gigs: a stop at Washington, DC's The Anthem and their first area date, New Year's Eve at Asheville, N.C.'s ExploreAsheville.com Arena. Several members of the day's next entertainers, Old Crow Medicine Show, used to live in nearby Charlottesville, Va., and the musicians opened things up appropriately with \"Carry Me Back to Virginia .\" The early part of their show was filled with theatrics and sing-alongs like their signature tune \"Wagon Wheel,\" but things peaked when they brought out <mark>Weir</mark> for acoustic-guitar driven takes on \"Mexicali Blues,\" \"Cumberland Blues\" and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\" Old Crow founder Ketch Secor described the surprise sit in as a \"dream\" from the stage. The main stage's penultimate act, The Revivalists, kept the evening's energy up, spicing their set with a cover of The Who's \"Eminence Front\" and their own crossover hit, \"Wish I Knew You .\" In recent years, The Revivalists have grown to embody the festival spirit with their mix of string, brass and improv-schooled energy, and frontman <mark>David Shaw</mark> took advantage of the band's surroundings, moving to the lip of the large Lockn' stage to address his audience several times. Before welcoming Trucks for his second set, Anastasio and his seven-person backing band ran through a mix of classic TAB songs during what he jokingly described as the \"shortest set ever .\" The octet kicked things off with \"Cayman Review,\" one of the standout tunes from Anastasio's 2002 solo release, and charged through rhythmic, Afro-beat influenced originals \"Mozambique\" and \"Alive Again,\" as well as \"Valentine,\" \"Night Speaks to a Woman,\" \"Simple Twist Up Dave\" and the 70 Volt Parade-era single \"Tuesday .\" After the final note of \"First Tube\" drifted into the ether, much of the crowd moved to Garcia's Forrest, where Galactic had set up shop. Meanwhile, Anastasio, Tedeschi and Trucks were preparing for the second part of their two-set, two-day collaboration."}, {"articleID": "2016121312_00409997_W", "names": {"Paul Barber": ["Q7149214", "Q7149215", "Q7149216", "Q7149218"]}, "date": "2016-12-13", "url": "http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=31543", "content": "Diocese of East Anglia to lead the way in opening new Catholic schools December 13, 2016 The Catholic Diocese of East Anglia is to be among the first to open new Catholic schools after the proposed removal of the 50% faith admissions cap, with plans for up to eight in the pipeline. East Anglia has some of the most severe shortage of places in Catholic schools in the country due to the demographic changes that have taken place in the region over the past decade. Since Prime Minister Theresa May announced the proposed removal of the 50% cap on faith admissions, the Diocese has been progressing with a number of bids. Should the policy be lifted after the Government's consultation on the issue closed on December 12, the Diocese is in a position to act straight away to move towards the opening of new schools. The areas of East Anglia where the new schools are being proposed are those with some of the highest need for places and where possible sites for the schools have already been identified. In Cambridgeshire, the Diocese wants to establish a high school and a primary school in West Cambourne and another primary in the Cherry Hinton area. The Diocese also wants to establish a new primary school in Peterborough. A new Catholic primary school is also being proposed in Thetford within the significant new housing development planned to the north of the town, whilst two primaries and possible sixth form provision are hoped for in Norwich. In addition, the Sacred Heart Convent School in Swaffham is also considering proposals for a new free school as well as possible expansion plans. Assistant Director for the Schools Commission for the Diocese of East Anglia, Helen Bates, said: \"It is a very exciting time and we are really looking forward to opening new schools which are desperately needed to meet the demand we already have here in East Anglia .\" For the Catholic Church, the cap has meant it has been unable to open any new Catholic schools in case it results in Catholic children being turned away from a Catholic school. In East Anglia we have some of the most severe shortages of places, which is why we want to bid for so many new schools. \"Brian Conway, Chief Executive Officer of the St John the Baptist Catholic Multi-Academy Trust, which currently covers six primaries and a high school in Norfolk and north Suffolk, said:\" The possibility of new Catholic schools is hugely exciting. Catholic schools have a long history of providing a successful education to widely diverse pupil populations. For example, our current primary school in Norwich, St Francis of Assisi, has more than 40% of its pupils whose first language is not English. \"We also have a real need for Catholic primary school places in north Norwich and this is growing as large housing developments in places like Sprowston and Rackheath are planned. A school in north Norwich could serve a Catholic need from this housing as well as an existing need across north Norfolk where there are no Catholic schools. We are also considering the possibility of new sixth form provision in central Norwich, which could be linked to extra 11-16 places at Notre Dame High School .\" Director of the Catholic Education Service, <mark>Paul Barber</mark>, said: \"This is fantastic news from the Diocese of East Anglia and we warmly welcome their announcement. Up and down the country we are seeing pockets of high demand for Catholic education and if the cap is lifted we will be able to answer that call. Catholic schools are the most ethnically diverse in the country and consistently outperform the national average when it comes to KS2 and KS4 results. We are excited at this opportunity to give more children an outstanding Catholic education .\" Notre Dame pupils in Science class Parents can register their interest in any of the new schools at: http: //rcdea.org.uk/freeschools/ Share:"}, {"articleID": "2014060703_00019929_W", "names": {"Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"], "Scott Thompson": ["Q16214236", "Q2886450", "Q324114", "Q559081", "Q7437374", "Q7437375", "Q7437376", "Q7437377"]}, "date": "2014-06-06", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mg-casey-kasem-hospitalized-critical-condition-20140606-story.html?track=rss", "content": "Casey Kasem makes an audition tape in 1971.
