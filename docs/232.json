(AP Photo/Boris Vergara) Numerous governments in the Western Hemisphere quickly recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president of his crisis-torn country Wednesday. The United States and all but one member of the Lima Group of regional nations threw their support behind Guaido after he declared himself interim president in a defiant speech before masses of anti-government demonstrators. The declaration by the Lima Group, which has been vocal in denouncing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was signed by Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. Mexico was the only member to not sign. The group said it supported the beginning of the process of a democratic transition in Venezuela following its constitution with aim of carrying out new elections as soon as possible. It also condemned acts of violence in Venezuela and made a call for peace. U.S. President Donald Trump called on Maduro to resign and said the U.S. would use the \"full weight\" of its economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuela's democracy. Venezuelans have been suffering from an economic and governance crisis that has led millions to flee hyperinflation and severe shortages of food and medicine. Paraguay was the first regional country to express support after Guaido took an oath before thousands of supporters. \"Count on us to embrace freedom and democracy again,\" Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez said on Twitter. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Latin America's largest nation also would support the 35-year-old lawmaker \"so that peace and democracy return to Venezuela .\" There was no immediate reaction from Cuba, which is the top regional ally of Maduro, nor from Nicaragua, which is also close to Maduro's socialist government. Maduro was sworn into a contested second term two weeks ago in a move condemned by dozens of nations. Guaido has said it is his right under Venezuela's constitution to take over the presidency until new elections can be called. But not everyone backed his bold move. Bolivian President Evo Morales condemned what he called an imperialist attack. \"Our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and Nicolas Maduro, in these decisive hours when the claws of imperialism are once again trying to deal a death blow on democracy and self-determination on the peoples of South America,\" Morales tweeted. \"We will not be the backyard of the U.S. again .\" A spokesman for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico continued to recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president. \"We maintain our position of neutrality in the Venezuelan conflict,\" <mark>Jesus Ramirez</mark> Cuevas told Mexico's Milenio news television channel. \"The Mexican government is analyzing the situation in Venezuela. Until now, there is no change in its diplomatic relations with that country nor with its government .\" Maduro responded to Guaido's move by cutting off diplomatic relations with the U.S., the largest importer of Venezuelan oil, and announced that American diplomats had 72 hours to leave his country. He also heaped much of the blame for developments on U.S. imperialism and Colombia's \"oligarchy .\" Colombian President Ivan Duque said his nation would accompany Guaido \"in this process of transition toward democracy so that the Venezuelan people can free themselves from the dictatorship .\" Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Associated Press.

Simultaneous clean-ups at various locations in the Valley accounted for a total of more than 33,000 pounds of trash being hauled to the dump, and accepted, free of charge. The inaugural Pick A Park aspect of the day was a great success, with dozens of people helping out at different locations, from the waterfront along Lazo Road (Point Holmes Recreation Association), to areas on Lake Trail Road (thanks to Comox Valley Land Trust and Morrison Streamkeepers), and many points in between. The Comox Valley Chamber of Commerce tidied Standard Park. The Comox Valley Pickleball Association adopted the Highland Park area. We Are Wildness, and Kindred Custom Snowboards converged on Farnham Road to clean that area together. We had neighbourhood groups cleaning up their areas (residents along Minto Road were responsible for gathering nearly a ton of garbage), and others who took on popular pathways, such as the Royston Trail (600 pounds picked up there). A crew of volunteers tackled a couple of troublesome spots along Piercy Road, picking up everything from couches to the burned out shell of a boat. Schools even got into the spirit of the event. Saltwater Waldorf School spent a day earlier in the week cleaning up an area west of the Comox Lake Dam. One group that did an outstanding job was the crew from the Fanny Bay area, as organized by James Barth and his Facebook group \"Stop Comox Valley Illegal Dumping .\" Approximately 20 people took ownership of an area at the end of Cook Creek Road and collected 9,900 pounds of garbage in just over four hours of work. Barth acknowledged members from the Comox Valley ATV Club, the Fanny Bay Community Association and even a group from Campbell River that came to lend a hand. \"I help them and they help me,\" Barth said of the Campbell River crew, members of a Facebook group called \"Keep Our Region Beautiful - Help Prevent Illegal Dumping .\" We had a bin supplied by B & D (Containers) - they dropped it off, they picked it up, driver was excellent to deal with, \"said Barth .\" And the CVRD was definitely a help, giving me tips on how to get it all done - that would have been Stephanie. So it went across very well. \"Barth said despite being familiar with the area, the amount of garbage picked up surprised him .\" I had absolutely no idea, \"he said .\" Within two hours, half the bin was full. It blew me away - just blew me away. \"Not to be outdone were the 39 Courtenay and District Fish and Game Protective Association members, who sent 22,500 pounds of garbage to the dump .\" One of the nice things that a lot of people noticed, is many of the areas that have been problem areas in the past weren't problems this year, \"said Courtenay and District Fish and Game Club caretaker Dave Munk. J.R. Edgett Excavating Ltd., donated a backhoe and truck, with drivers, for the day and Gary Marcus Trucking also supplied a truck and a backhoe, for the heavy lifting. Dim's Bins supplied a bin on-site at the F & G, free of charge, for easy dumping access, and Thrifty Foods went above and beyond, supplying free lunch for everyone who showed up at the Fish and Game clubhouse afterwards.

Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. \"We will make it our job to prove the skeptics wrong .\" So far, alas, the skeptics have been right. The GOP's big majority in the House became a curse, not a blessing; little of the legislation that Boehner and McConnell sought has passed. Instead, the GOP's zealously conservative Freedom Caucus pushed Boehner out of office and blocked the rise of his chosen successor, Rep. <mark>Kevin McCarthy</mark> of California. \"We are not solving the country's problems; we are only adding to them,\" Rep. Paul D. Ryan, R-Wisconsin, acknowledged last week as he announced his decision to seek the speaker's chair. By all accounts, Ryan is likely to win the job easily. Last week, he won support from all three wings of the House's factionalized Republicans. That will give him a chance to start over. \"We can show the country what a common-sense conservative agenda looks like,\" he told his colleagues. Still, Ryan faces the same challenge that brought down Boehner and <mark>McCarthy</mark>: the Freedom Caucus, which not only spurns bipartisan compromises but has made its first goal to purge the GOP of its moderates. And amazingly, some Freedom Caucus members consider Ryan, a thoroughgoing conservative by any traditional definition, to be dangerously moderate. Ultras in the Freedom Caucus distrust Ryan because, as chairman of the House's tax-writing committee, he made a bipartisan budget deal to keep the government running in 2013. (Any deal had to be bipartisan because the Democrats had a majority in the Senate that year .) Others worry because he long supported bipartisan efforts for comprehensive immigration reform, even though he's abandoned that goal in the face of grassroots opposition. One even derided Ryan for wanting to preserve time to spend with his young family. \"It's like interviewing a maid for a job and she says,' I don't clean windows,'\" Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona, told the Hill. Remarkably, Ryan met these truculent revolutionaries halfway, even though he was already the choice of most House Republicans. The Freedom Caucus demanded changes in House rules to reduce the speaker's power; Ryan agreed that the GOP conference should consider the idea. The caucus asked him to promise that he would never allow a floor vote on any measure unless a majority of Republicans supported it (the \"Hastert Rule\" ); Ryan agreed. And the Freedom Caucus rejected Ryan's proposal to change a rule that allows a single member to call for a vote to remove the speaker, a weapon it used against Boehner. Ryan agreed to postpone the issue. It was a remarkable process. The Freedom Caucus, with less than one-fifth of GOP members in its ranks, won concessions from a man most other Republicans considered their only viable candidate for the job. Still, beneath his show of flexibility, Ryan appeared to be pursuing a pragmatic strategy of divide and conquer, a course that might enable him to defuse the Freedom Caucus as a constantly ticking time bomb. Ryan has the suppor t of about two-thirds of the Freedom Caucus' members, a break from the group's customary unity. Until now, the group has maintained its influence by wielding an undivided bloc of about 40 votes, just enough to deprive Boehner or any other speaker of his working majority. But as my colleague Lisa Mascaro pointed out in The Los Angeles Times last week, that unity is showing signs of fraying. At least two members recently quit the caucus. If Ryan can co-opt half or more of the Freedom Caucus' members, the group's leverage will erode. A divided caucus won't be able to take Speaker Ryan hostage the way it tormented Boehner and <mark>McCarthy</mark>. But making that strategy work won't be easy. Ryan's House faces a series of daunting tests, the same tough fiscal issues that divided Republicans under Boehner. Congress must raise the federal debt limit by Nov. 3; Boehner may stay in office just long enough to engineer a bipartisan vote with Democratic support, relieving Ryan of a headache. But soon after that, Congress must pass a funding bill to keep the government running after Dec. 11. And then Congress turns to the budget, in search of a two-year deal that would last past the 2016 presidential election. All three measures will almost certainly need President Obama's signature to pass, which means GOP leaders will need to compromise somewhere. \"Whatever our differences, we're all conservatives,\" Ryan told House Republicans last week. His election as speaker may give his party a moment of unity, but it will also open a new phase in the unfinished battle over the GOP's soul. The members of the Freedom Caucus haven't promised him a honeymoon; only a truce. Doyle McManus is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times. Readers may send him email at doyle.mcmanus @ latimes.com.

the wolverines are only listed on 10 of 28 brackets at this point, but that's likely to change if the wolverines beat michigan state saturday (in a contest that's sold out and, the athletic department has declared, a maize out, meaning u-m fans are expected to wear their maize to the 2:00 (cbs tv) game). a victory means the wolverines will likely finish in a three - or four-way tie for fourth place in the big ten depending on what happens with the following teams: illinois: the illini seem headed for a 9-9 finish, standing 8-8 with games on tap at purdue (tuesday) and home to indiana saturday. michigan state: the spartans (8-8) host iowa for senior night wednesday before traveling to ann arbor saturday. penn state: psu (8-8) has been good at home but gets a huge test tonight against ohio state before traveling to minnesota sunday. if all four teams finish 9-9, the wolverines earn the no. 4 seed by virtue of the tiebreaker (overall record against the others tied with them). u-m would hold a 4-1 record against the other three. if penn state were to lose two, illinois would be the four seed and u-m five. either way, a victory (and at least one psu loss) assures the wolverines of a first-round bye and a friday big ten tournament game the following week. a loss to the spartans and u-m would be playing on thursday, but bracketology 101 believes michigan can secure a bid. \"michigan made the cut, despite their loss at home to wisconsin on wednesday, because we think they have a decent chance to beat michigan state at home this weekend and then win their first big ten tourney game,\" they wrote. **** in other basketball news, former michigan great cazzie russell (1964-66) earned a place in the national collegiate basketball hall of fame, the national association of basketball coaches (nabc) foundation announced monday. the class of 2011 also includes ralph sampson (virginia), <mark>james worthy</mark> (north carolina) and <mark>chris mullin</mark> (st. john's), coaches <mark>bob knight</mark> and eddie sutton and contributors joe vancisin and eddie einhorn. the honorees will be inducted into the national collegiate basketball hall of fame on sunday, nov. 20, at the midland theatre in kansas city as part of a three-day celebration of college basketball. a three-time all-american and two-time big ten player of the year, russell led the wolverines to the ncaa final four as a sophomore and again as a junior, when u-m finished as national runner-up to ucla. russell was named national player of the year as a senior, when he averaged 30.8 points per game, and helped michigan to the elite eight. \"i stayed up the night before [my last game] thinking i've been here four years, all this is about to end and then i'm going to have to face the world,\" russell told the wolverine back in 2006. \"it was a great, great opportunity for me as a young man to have gone to a great institution like michigan. no matter what anybody says, nobody will ever take that away from me?
