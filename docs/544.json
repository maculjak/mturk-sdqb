(Google Earth) Canada Four of Nine Aboard Float Plane Crash on Remote B.C. Island Dead By The Canadian Press July 27, 2019 Updated: July 27, 2019 Share LINKEDIN PINTEREST REDDIT TUMBLR STUMBLEUPON VICTORIA, Canada--Four people have been confirmed dead with five others injured in a float plane crash on an uninhabited island off the northern end of Vancouver Island. Lt. Chelsea Dubeau with the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Victoria said they received word Friday that a Cessna 208 float plane had crashed on Addenbroke Island, about 100 kilometres off the northern end of Vancouver Island. The centre said the chartered plane that had nine people aboard crashed at about 11 a.m.. It was headed to Calvert Island, a significantly larger neighbouring island, it said. \"Unfortunately we can confirm at this time that there are four individuals that are deceased,\" Dubeau said. #BCEHS paramedics have assessed and treated the five survivors of the Addenbroke Island plane crash. Two patients in serious condition are being airlifted with critical care paramedic teams to Vancouver. Three other patients were transported to a local area hospital .--Emerg Health Services (@ BC_EHS) July 27, 2019 B.C. Emergency Health Services said two of the survivors were airlifted to hospital in Vancouver in serious condition, while three others were taken to a local hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries. Spokeswoman <mark>Shannon Miller</mark> said paramedic ground crews and two air ambulance critical care teams had been staged in Port Hardy for survivors of the crash. Critical care teams are made up of paramedics with the highest level of specialized training, with a focus on acute medical emergencies and air medical responses, she added. Seair Seaplanes, which offers daily charter flights and scenic tour flights in British Columbia, said in a statement that the \"serious accident\" involved one of its Caravan float planes. \"Our thoughts are with those involved in the crash and their loved ones and are devastated by this fatal accident. We are currently working with first responders and authorities and have immediately suspended all flights,\" the statement said. The company said it would provide updates as details become available and its focus was on working with authorities to provide whatever support is needed. Dubeau said the BC Ferries vessel Northern Sea Wolf was on scene quickly because it was nearby and a Canadian Coast Guard helicopter, Cormorant helicopter, and Buffalo fixed-wing plane were all dispatched to lend assistance. Dubeau said no one lives on Addenbroke Island, although there is a lighthouse on the island. The island is on the route the ferry takes from Port Hardy to Prince Rupert. Chris Krepski, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board, said the board was gathering information before deciding what its next steps would be.

Picture: Getty Cricket Aussie superheroes skittle England by Selina Steele in Hove 29th Jul 2019 6:10 AM premium_icon Subscriber only 0 WHAT'S better than one superhero? Two of course. Which is exactly what the Southern Stars have in Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry. Meg Lanning of Australia dives to make her ground as <mark>Amy Jones</mark> of England takes the bails off during the 2nd Vitality Women's IT20 in Hove, England. Picture: Getty Australia was experiencing a little wobble at 3-35 until Perry joined Lanning for an unbeaten 87-run partnership to claim victory in the second Ashes T20 international. While Lanning's T20 World record of 133 not out was all muscle and force, her knock today at County Ground, Hove was calculated grit. The seven wicket win came with 2.1 overs to spare, Perry finishing on 47 not out and Lanning on 43 not out. But England had its chance with Lanning. If only stand-in keeper <mark>Amy Jones</mark> had the forethought to backhand the ball at the stumps a-la Alyssa Healy. Natalie Sciver of England is bowled out by Georgia Wareham of Australia during the T20 in Hove. Picture: Getty Instead, Lanning survived a run-out scare without having faced a ball. It would have been a diamond duck but Lanning's full body dive, Kate Cross's wide throw and <mark>Jones</mark>'s reach for the stumps were enough to save the Aussie skipper. At that stage Austalia was 1/23. At first it seemed far fetched when England coach <mark>Mark Robinson</mark> said Australia was just a side that were gifted \"God given physical attributes\". Perhaps he was right and this dominance was delivered on divine intervention. Perhaps he was wrong and it was the years of training, preparation and strong domestic competition. Georgia Wareham of Australia celebrates with her teammates. Picture: Getty Either way, Australia continued its summer of dominance with Ellyse Perry becoming the first player, male or female, to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. \"I guess it's lovely, but I wasn't aware of it,\" Perry said. \"I actually think in T20 cricket at international level, we probably play it as much as the men, so I have played a pretty big volume of games now - over 100, so I suppose when you have played 100 games you might get close to it. Ellyse Perry became the first player to reach 1000 runs and 100 wickets in T20 internationals. Picture: Henry Browne/Getty Images\" That's probably the only reason I'm there - because I've played a lot of games. \"It has just been really nice to turn up every game and for us to perform and to find a way to win and win dominantly .\" It was really cool to be out there with Meg. I really enjoy batting with her and she's incredible when she's going. To be at the other end is quite easy really. \"Here's how the game unfolded: IN A SNAPSHOT: England won the toss and perhaps fearing another Meg Lanning masterclass, and the game being over in six overs, decide to bat. On the back of Tammy Beaumont, they bat through the 20 overs finishing 8-121. A six in the final over from Sophie Ecclestone sets Australia a run rate of 6.10. Meg Lanning strikes good form during the first game of the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty After a shaky start, Lanning and Perry to put together a chanceless partnership of 87 to guide Australia to victory. BUNNY BAIT: Australia's Ellyse Perry, opening the bowling, bewitched <mark>Amy Jones</mark> for the fourth time this series. With zero footwork, <mark>Jones</mark> spooned a catch to Georgia Wareham at cover point and England was 1/1 after the first over. THE HEROES: Lanning and Perry. Ridiculously talented, ridiculously smart, ridiculously patient. The composed pair happily waited for the bad ball, which inevitably would come, and easily ticked off the run a ball needed. Beth Mooney has been another star for Australia in the T20 series against England. Picture: Getty A six in the 15th over from Perry saw Australia needing 18 off 28 and it was all over bar a Pimm's to celebrate. SUPPORT ACTS: * Jess Jonassen's wicket in her first over, getting rid of Danni Wyatt, was due to the hot hands of Beth Mooney. Mooney running back with flight of the ball judged the catch perfectly. But ouch - this is where we don't mention her dropping Tammy Beaumont when Beaumont was on 35. But we do have to mention Mooney dropping Beaumont again on 39. Both chances were not as difficult as the one she held. Jonassen takes matters into her own hands and bowls Beaumont for 43 in the 12th over. * Warm up? What warm up! Georgia Wareham snared the dangerous Nat Sciver first ball. The England all rounder went across her stumps to glance the ball down fine leg but completely missed the ball. The leggie then backs this up by snaring England captain <mark>Heather Knight</mark>. Easy as you like, Wareham takes a gentle return catch after <mark>Knight</mark> came at her down the pitch. THE RECORD That player again - Perry. Ellyse Perry received player of the match for Australia in the recent Test against England and is setting records in the T20 arena. Picture: Getty Perry is the first player, either male or female, to complete the double of 100 wickets and 1000 STATE OF PLAY The post-mortem has already begun for England - records have fallen all series and all in favour of the Australians. England's domestic structure is being questioned while Australia's lauded. In comparison, The Southern Stars have set themselves up for a dynasty. Headlined by superstars Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry, and with the likes of Sophie Molineux and Georgia Wareham coming through it's hard to see other nations catching them. NEXT UP: 3rd T20 International at Bristol on July 31. More green and gold dominance. Can't see where England will find any improvement. Australia to go through the series undefeated.
