Photograph: Press 22 <mark>Steve Collins</mark>, father of murdered Limerick businessman Roy Collins, has moved back to the city to rebuild his family's life, he has said. The family fled Ireland in recent years to try and overcome the devastation wreaked on the them by gangland violence and intimidation. Mr Collins led a campaign, including street marches through Limerick, against the rampant criminality in the city and emigrated after testifying against members of the Dundon McCarthy gang who murdered his son in 2009. In October 2017, Wayne Dundon and Nathan Killeen, who are serving life sentences for the murder, had their convictions upheld by the Court of Appeal. Exactly ten years to the day of the killing of 35-year-old father-of-two Roy at the Coin Castle amusements arcade they ran at Roxboro Road in Limerick, his father said it was time to build a new life for his other son Steven in their home city. \"There is inward investment all the time now (in Limerick), we have the hanging gardens and the likes of that here now,\" he said. \"We have invested heavily in a bar here, my son Steven runs it. Father of murdered Roy Collins hopes others will give evidence\" We are trying to rebuild our lives, trying to rebuild Steven's life, to give him something to hold on to. We were comfortable in this city before all this came on our door, then we were destroyed and devastated in every way - this is a rebuilding thing now. \"Mr Collins said he remains\" haunted \"by his ordeal.\" It never leaves you...you never expect it to come into your life, the horrific way it happened, \"he said.\" It's a loss you never get over, nobody ever gets over losing a child - it doesn't matter what age they are. We are just happy to be moving on now. \"Mr Collins praised the support of the people of Limerick who came out onto the streets in solidarity with his family when they began their campaign against gang violence.\" It gave us the impetus to move on and talk to politicians and campaign to get the law changed. I think we've achieved that with the 2009 Justice Act, \"he said.\" I think Limerick is a different place. When we came back we noticed it how things have changed. The investment is coming into the city now. That wouldn't happened back in the day, in 2009. \"For such a small city, it was crazy. To get change, it is heartening.\" Mr Collins told RT\u00c9 Radio's Morning Ireland the change came at a huge cost to his family and the stress has \"put an awful burden\" on their health. \"We relocated to try rebuild our lives again, but it was tough, we always wanted to come back in Limerick. We sacrificed an awful lot for this city.\" It took the people of Limerick to stand up and say \"we are sick of this\" , he said, to bring about the changes. \"I'm just so happy it happened...this didn't just help Limerick - it helped the whole country.\" "}, {"articleID": "2017061707_00294928_W", "names": {"Dustin Johnson": ["Q1002293", "Q30015838"]}, "date": "2017-06-17", "url": "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/17/how-about-showing-dj-little-respect-201/", "content": "How about showing DJ little respect? a A Font Size PHOTO BY AP/CHRIS CARLSON Defending U.S. Open champion <mark>Dustin Johnson</mark>, the world's No. 1 player, won't repeat after missing the cut by three shots at Erin Hills on Friday. <mark>Johnson</mark> played the tournament's first eight holes in 3 over in the opening round and never recovered. As <mark>Dustin Johnson</mark> approached his ball buried in the tall grass on the 17th hole at Erin Hills, a fan standing just a few feet away offered a little pick-me-up to the world's No. 1 player. \"You got a nice bounce off my arm, Justin,\" the fan said proudly as he patted his right arm. Justin? It was that sort of day for <mark>Johnson</mark>, who either didn't notice the misspeak or didn't care, because by that point the first round in defense of his 2016 U.S. Open title was already headed the wrong direction. Starting on the back nine, he double-bogeyed 14, bogeyed 15 and was on his way to wasting a birdie at 16 with the errant drive on 17 that would lead to yet another bogey. Three over in four holes isn't a blueprint for disaster for the average golfer--like, for example, the guy in the gallery who just called the best player in the world by the wrong name--but it's a death knell at this U.S. Open. Just a few holes ahead, Rickie Fowler had four birdies on his front nine, another three on the back side for a 7-under 65. Even though <mark>Johnson</mark> played even-par golf the rest of the way to finish with a 3-over 75, it still left him 10 strokes back after the first round. \"Where I went wrong is when I laid it up in the hay,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said matter-of-factly after his round, referring to his brutal 14th. \"Got it on the green and three-putted for double. A great hole I played there.\" And just like that, the prohibitive favorite coming in was already on the ropes. By the time <mark>Johnson</mark> walked off the green on his final hole, 44 players were under par. He did better Friday, but not good enough, despite getting to the 1-over cut line after a birdie on 12. Bogeys on 13, 14 and 17 knocked him out of the tournament. He finished with a 1-over 73, a two-round total of 4-over 148. The race is on Olympic legend Michael Phelps is probably the greatest that's ever been in the water. Well, for a human. According to a news release from Discovery Channel, Phelps will race a great white shark as part of Shark Week on July 23. \"They are one of the fastest and most efficient predators on the planet: Sharks,\" the release said. \"He is our greatest champion to ever get in the water: Michael Phelps. 39 world records. 23 Olympic golds. But he has one competition left to win. An event so monumental no one has ever attempted it before. The world's most decorated athlete takes on the ocean's most efficient predator: Phelps V Shark--the race is on!\" Phelps is going to have his hands full. According to Jennifer Kennedy of ThoughtCo.com, sharks cruise at around 5 mph, but great whites can reach north of 25 mph if they're in attack-mode. \"Their swimming speed is 10 times faster than the typical human swimmer,\" Kennedy wrote. Phelps was clocked at 6 mph by ESPN.com at the height of his overwhelming success in 2010. The distance and the shark's state of mind will certainly play a role in the race. Phelps, 31, went cage diving with some great whites last weekend, perhaps scouting out his competition: Phelps will also take part in another Shark Week project, Shark School, which will \"dispel the myths and common misconceptions\" about the beasts. That puts Phelps on the first and last days of Shark Week.

Daniel Acke / Bloomberg via Getty Images Democrats could avoid another tech meltdown like the one that afflicted the Iowa caucuses with a better strategy for building the tools they need, progressive technology specialists say. The origins of the Iowa debacle are in a boom-and-bust cycle that places technology in competition with other priorities as time-crunched campaigns grapple with how best to spend as they hurtle toward an election. \"The easy way to spend money, that's reliable, is on advertising,\" says Evan Henshaw-Plath, a technologist who has built applications for progressive causes and was an early employee at Twitter. \"Spending money on technology is riskier and may or may not pay off.\" When campaigns commence, they hire staff, open offices, buy ads. When the campaign ends, the contracts end and the offices close. Code that is written is often abandoned and forgotten. \"We're rebuilding everything from scratch each cycle for everything that isn't finance and compliance,\" Henshaw-Plath says. \"We aren't funding organizations that can survive from one cycle to the next,\" he adds. \"We aren't funding the technology to be maintained from one cycle to the next. And we aren't releasing the code in a maintainable way and picking up again on the next cycle.\" Light falls on Shadow After the Iowa caucus, the spotlight swung to Shadow, the small tech company that built the glitchy application precinct chairs were supposed to use to report results. Shadow's primary business is operating two applications for the progressive movement: a messaging product and a data integration tool. The caucus app's lackluster performance brought scrutiny of the connections between Shadow, its main investor Acroynm, and various figures and campaigns in the Democratic Party. Such connections are no surprise in this corner of the tech world: It's common practice for Democratic candidates and Democratically-aligned causes to use political tools and technologies developed specifically for the left. There are essentially separate, parallel universes of tech vendors that develop tools for either Democrats or Republicans--but not both. \"It is a pretty deeply held value within the progressive community that you want to put your money where your values are,\" says Brady Kriss, the founder and executive director of Ragtag, a company that corrals tech workers who want to volunteer their skills to help progressive causes. \"It's not just about political competition. You don't want your money in any way, directly or indirectly, to go towards supporting issues or candidates that you find morally problematic.\" Some tech experts have pointed out that popular mainstream applications like Google Forms might have been a better choice for Iowa, rather than relying on a custom-designed app built on a small budget under time pressure. Using products already in wide commercial use has another benefit: they're likely to be supported and maintained. \"If you're building on top of that, you don't have to worry about that infrastructure,\" Kriss says. \"That really helps with the cyclical nature of campaigns and campaign tech. Because it's very, very hard to keep a small application like a phone app or a large database base application updated when every other year, no one cares.\" Building beyond the campaign cycle Advocates and entrepreneurs have tried to target the boom-bust dynamic. Higher Ground Labs--a venture capital firm with the mission of supporting progressive tech companies \"for experimentation and iteration that's no longer dependent on election dates\" --was an investor in the company went on to become Shadow. But <mark>Ann Lewis</mark>, chief technology officer for MoveOn.org, says that cyclical fundraising cycles continue to affect progressive tech vendors. One particular challenge she's noticed: A lot of the money for tech arrives in September, just two months before a November election. \"That's often not enough time to really take advantage of the surge of funding in software teams,\" she says. What more money often buys is more staff--but adding engineers to a tech project only a few months before launch actually can hinder the team's speed and efficiency, <mark>Lewis</mark> says. Recurring donations can smooth out spiky funding. But when it comes to structural change, <mark>Lewis</mark> has one big request: open source software, frameworks, and collaboration spaces. Open source software means anyone can access and build on the code. The most common place for developers to share their code and collaborate is the online platform Github. If political tech developers did make more software open source, <mark>Lewis</mark> says they might be able to break free from election-driven peaks and valleys--and sustain applications long enough to make them relevant for more than one campaign cycle. \"Not all projects will be successful and not all projects will live forever. There's a constant evolution in the frameworks and tools that we use to build any kind of software,\" she says. \"But I think investing in open source early is a way to let the best software rise to the top and live past that campaign horizon.\" Copyright 2020 NPR.

I've always wanted to play there.\" \"I'm sure going for the first time for a World Series game, it should be fun,\" he said. Well, wait until he trips over a bullpen mound chasing a foul ball. Or a teammate loses a fly in the mist that wafts above shallow center. Or those swirling winds turn a routine popup into an all-out scramble. Who knows? Might even get a crazy carom off that odd-shaped brick facade on the right-field wall, resulting in the first Series inside-the-park home run since 1929. Yep, loads of fun. Hosmer, <mark>Alex Gordon</mark>, Mike Moustakas and most of the Royals will get their first look at quirky AT & T Park during a workout Thursday. Then it's on to Game 3 on Friday with Kansas City and the Giants tied at 1-all. Tim Hudson starts for San Francisco against Jeremy Guthrie. The Royals' only trip to San Francisco came in 2005 and they took two of three. Buddy Bell was the manager, Tony Graffanino batted third and Jeremy Affeldt was in the bullpen. The 35-year-old Affeldt now pitches for the Giants and came on in relief Wednesday night in a 7-2 loss. He said he figured the Royals could handle the new park. \"That's an athletic team over there. So I think they can make adjustments. I don't think we'll go in thinking that they're at a disadvantage because of not being at our ballpark,\" he said. About one-third of the Royals have played at AT & T Park with other teams. Of the most frequent visitors, Josh Willingham has hit .352 with five homers in 16 games and Omar Infante has batted .307 in 19 games, STATS said. Among the pitchers, Guthrie did fine in two starts and Jason Frasor made two relief appearances. Outfielder Lorenzo Cain played one game at the stadium in 2010 when he was with Milwaukee. The AL Championship Series MVP plans to practice with coach Rusty Kuntz to \"work on my angles and see how the park plays.\" \"It's kind of a work in progress and a wait-and-see type thing,\" Cain said. Good luck, Giants designated hitter <mark>Michael Morse</mark> said. \"It's a big park; right field is tricky. The wind does a lot of different things in the outfield, so our guys are used to it,\" he said. \"It's tough. It's tough out there. But everybody's a professional. I don't think it will be a factor,\" he said. One thing will change, for sure. With no DH in the NL park, <mark>Morse</mark> and Kansas City's <mark>Billy Butler</mark> will lose their spots - <mark>Morse</mark> drove in a run during a 7-1 win in the opener, while <mark>Butler</mark> already has three hits and a pair of RBIs. With tight foul ground, gusts that whip off McCovey Cove, twilight starts and pesky seagulls that hover around in the late innings, a lot of balls become adventures in San Francisco. In 2007, <mark>Ichiro Suzuki</mark> hit the first inside-the-park home run in an All-Star game when his shot off the right-field wall took a weird ricochet. There have been nine inside-the-parkers in World Series play. Lou Gehrig and Casey Stengel are on the list, and Mule Haas of the Philadelphia Athletics hit the last one in 1929. Plus, postseason is frequently a weather adventure in the Bay Area. Players need to pack for all sorts of conditions - short sleeves, hoodies, hats and gloves. During the NLCS, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said the teams played in the toughest winds of the season. Right fielder Hunter Pence had no chance trying to track a fly ball by St. Louis' Kolten Wong that landed for a triple. \"You play this game, you play in a lot of different ballparks and you find a way to adjust,\" Pence said this week. \"I think everyone's going to enjoy it.\" Moustakas was looking forward to the trip.

An off-screen heckler interrupted with a cry of \"You're a racist!\" But the \"heckler\" was comedian Larry David, who before <mark>Trump</mark> arrived onstage had been seen impersonating Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. \"Larry, what are you doing?\" <mark>Trump</mark> asked with a trace of exasperation. \"I heard if I yelled that, they'd give me $5,000,\" said David with a shrug, echoing an offer made publicly by one of the Hispanic groups protesting <mark>Trump</mark>'s appearance. \"As a businessman,\" <mark>Trump</mark> told him, \"I can fully respect that.\" <mark>Trump</mark>'s 90 minutes in the \"SNL\" spotlight followed weeks of growing anticipation, increasingly sharp criticism and mounting calls for him to be dropped from the show. But the Republican presidential candidate hosted Saturday's \"SNL\" as scheduled. And, at least in NBC's Studio 8H, there was no more unrest--orchestrated or otherwise. (Deport Racism, the group that made the $5,000 offer, tweeted that David would get the bounty, \"joke or not.\" ) Only hours after the broadcast, <mark>Trump</mark> was back on television and characteristically bullish about his performance, calling it \"very well received and probably got very good ratings, who knows.\" Very good, but not spectacular. Preliminary Nielsen ratings measuring households in 56 U.S. markets gave Saturday's \"SNL\" its highest rating only since January 2012. Basketball great <mark>Charles Barkley</mark> was host that night. Full results, including viewership figures, will be released Thursday, NBC said. <mark>Trump</mark> also told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that some sketches were cut because there were \"a little risque.\" He did not go into details. During his monologue, <mark>Trump</mark> promised his hosting appearance would be \"something special,\" while noting that many people had asked him why he accepted the gig. He said they had told him, \"You're brilliant, you're handsome, you're rich. The world is waiting for you to be president. Why?\" His answer: \"I had nothing better to do.\" \"But part of the reason I'm here,\" he added, \"is to show I can take a joke.\" In one sketch, <mark>Trump</mark> was willing to mock his penchant for tweeting insults about people with whom he differs. \"I hate to break it to you guys,\" he told viewers, \"but I'm not going to be in the next sketch.\" Instead, off-camera, he live-tweeted comments that were flashed on the screen about \"SNL\" cast members performing a skit: \"Cecily Strong is not a nice person.\" \"Kate McKinnon was born stupid.\" \"I love SNL...SNL loves me. But everyone in this sketch is a total loser who can bite my dust.\" Another sketch imagined <mark>Trump</mark> in the Oval Office in 2018--two years into his presidency--savoring his many successes. By then, Syria is at peace. China is borrowing money from the U.S. <mark>Trump</mark>'s real-life daughter, Ivanka, is the administration's secretary of the interior, and announces the Washington Monument will be covered with gold. Did it all sound too good to be possible? \"If you think that's how it's going to be when I'm president, you're wrong. It's going to be even better,\" <mark>Trump</mark> said, addressing the audience. \"I said to the writers of this sketch,\" Keep it modest .' \"His preference, he insisted, was to keep expectations low for his presidency and not overpromise. Until Saturday, just eight politicians had served as guest hosts in the NBC sketch comedy series' 40 years. Only one of those--the Rev. Al Sharpton, in 2003--was actively involved in a presidential bid at the time. (Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared in last month's season premiere, but not as the host .) The star turn granted <mark>Trump</mark> fanned the flames of outrage sparked in June when he announced his Republican candidacy for president and described some Mexicans who are in the United States illegally as criminals and rapists. Hours before the show's live broadcast, dozens of protesters marched from <mark>Trump</mark> Tower to NBC's studio in Rockefeller Plaza, chanting in both English and Spanish and carrying signs. In Spanish, they chanted:\" The people united shall never be defeated \"and signs declared SNL racist.\" I feel like they're giving him a platform, \"said Hazel Hernandez, 26, who emigrated from El Salvador and now lives in Brooklyn.\" I'm an immigrant myself, so I'm pretty outraged. I've been in this country for many years, and I'm outraged that they would let him host SNL. It's upsetting. \"<mark>Trump</mark>'s comments last summer spurred NBC to sever its Miss Universe ties with him while declaring he would never return to his\" Apprentice \"role. But leading up to Saturday's broadcast, NBC did not respond to accusations that it had reversed itself, or to the outcry against <mark>Trump</mark> that had built since\" SNL \"announced his host booking last month. Typically outspoken, <mark>Trump</mark> welcomed the controversy, predicting it would only boost his audience. It wasn't <mark>Trump</mark>'s first turn as guest host. The billionaire developer and media personality presided in April 2004, a few weeks after he debuted as host of NBC's\" The Apprentice. \"This time, while <mark>Trump</mark> demonstrated once again that he could take a joke, he was running for president.

Novel NextGen Sequencing Test Developed for Retinoblastoma Test identifies germline mutations of gene responsible for childhood eye cancer 6/2/2014 5:10 PM EDT Source Newsroom: Contact Information Available for logged-in reporters only Newswise - Researchers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) have developed a unique next-generation sequencing test for the gene linked to retinoblastoma. The new approach is both more comprehensive and can be conducted in less time than existing tests - enabling early detection of the cancer's genetic cause, which is critical for optimal treatment outcomes. The test was developed to serve the needs of the Retinoblastoma program at CHLA's Vision Center, one of the largest clinical programs in the U.S., caring for approximately 20% of the nation's retinoblastoma cases and seeing as many as 50 new patients each year. Retinoblastoma - a malignant cancer of early childhood that arises from immature retinal cells in one or both eyes - can start growing at any time before birth up until about seven years of age. Among infants and children, common signs of this cancer include having a white \"glow\" or \"glint\" in the pupil of one or both eyes, the presence of a white pupil in a color photo, or crossed or misaligned eyes. Early detection is vital because, when left untreated, retinoblastoma can result in blindness or death. In germline cases, the disease causing mutation is present in cells throughout the body resulting in tumors in both eyes, as well as in other locations throughout the body. Therefore, early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for determining the best course of treatment. A team of physicians and scientists from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine's Center for Personalized Medicine, working with clinicians and surgeons from the Vision Center, developed the CHLA retinoblastoma next generation (RB1 NextGen) sequencing panel based on deep DNA sequencing technology, using novel technical and bioinformatics methodology to sequence the entire RB1 gene. Conventional genetic testing for retinoblastoma typically involves sequencing of specific hot spots within the gene where there are known to be numerous mutations. When CHLA researchers set out to develop their own laboratory-derived test, they took a very different approach in order to sequence the entire gene from end to end. \"Typically, we have used NextGen sequencing capability to sequence many genes at a relatively low depth of coverage\" explained Alexander Judkins, MD, FRCP, head of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. \"Our team took a very different approach by deciding to look at a high depth of coverage of a single gene, sequencing through the entire gene, which is technically very difficult to do.\" With the existing NextGen sequencing approach for retinoblastoma, there are regions of genes that do not get examined at all, potentially allowing significant data to be missed, added Timothy Triche, MD, PhD, Director of the Center for Personalized Medicine at CHLA. \"New data tells us that the non-coding DNA is extremely important. And one of the strengths of our approach is in examining those non-coding areas.\" By sequencing the whole gene, researchers are able to see more frequent occurrences of germline mutations of the RB gene. Because germline mutations can be passed on, this knowledge can better inform the correct treatment approach for patients when these mutations are identified. \"We used to think that if a child had a tumor in one eye and not in the other eye, it was a result of a somatic mutation. And because somatic carriers don't pass on mutated genes, we believed removal of the tumor stopped the cancer,\" says <mark>Tom Lee</mark>, MD, Director of the Vision Center at CHLA. \"But now we know that there is a percentage - on the order of 10 to 15% of those children who had an apparent somatic mutation - who are actually carrying a germline mutation, putting them at risk of developing subsequent tumors during adolescence or early adulthood.\" <mark>Lee</mark> said that the ability to determine the existence of RB1 germline mutations early has significant implications - not only for the prognosis of a new patient with retinoblastoma, but for siblings who could also be at risk and eventually for a patient's own children, if a germline mutation is detected in a retinoblastoma survivor that could be passed on to future generations. With a legacy of treating hundreds of children with retinoblastoma, CHLA now has the ability to also offer this unique and comprehensive screening test to survivors of the disease or their family members, as well as to patients at other cancer centers. \"We believe that siblings and children of carriers of the germline should be tested immediately after birth because by detecting the gene mutations early can save a patient's vision,\" says <mark>Lee</mark>. Approximately two-thirds of retinoblastoma patients at CHLA have unilateral cases of RB, or cancer in just one eye. While only 15% of cases will test positive for a germline mutation, physicians must treat all patients as though the cancer could potentially be bilaterial, or present in both eyes, a condition commonly associated with having a germline mutation. \"Historically, genetic testing can take up to three or four months-which is a very long time when a child's health is at stake,\" said Jonathan Kim, MD, director of the Retinoblastoma Program at CHLA. \"Doing our tests faster and on site has the potential to significantly improve treatments outcomes for all of our patients.\" \"This test enables our researchers to look at the RB1 gene more comprehensively,\" says Judkins. The collection of new genomic data on RB1 will hopefully enable basic researchers to translate this material into biologically meaningful insights, leading to earlier detection and new treatments for both primary and recurrent disease. \"Heath care providers interested in the new RB1 NextGen Sequencing test may contact the Laboratory Service Center of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Children's Hospital Los Angeles by calling KIDZ LAB (877-543-9522) or 323 361 2423.
