He was talking about sabka vikas, He was saying I will be a prime minister for all Indians, he was saying that constitution was my holy book and so on and on. So I said we not only have to welcome these statements but by welcoming them we are putting up a yardstick against which we will judge him in future. If I had criticized him even when he was saying the right things, it undermines our credibility to criticise him when he does a wrong thing, \"Tharoor said. Six months after PM Modi came to power, Tharoor said he started writing his book\" Paradoxical Prime Minister'. \"I was able to begin it with words, I told you so,\" he said. \"He says all these liberal things and makes all these pronouncements. But he rests for his own political importance for his electoral viability across the country on the most liberal elements in the Indian society,\" the Congress leader said. \"Unfortunately, Mr Modi has spent the last four and a half year proving me right .\" Jan 24, 2019 4:16 pm (IST) Shashi Tharoor on what kind of \"liberal' he is:\" I think of myself as an instinctive liberal, not just ideologically but also in my attitude in life.

While the President sought to put the best light on the developments, it was a major shift for Mr. Trump, who had repeatedly refused to open the government, and allow for negotiations on border security to go forward--as his decision on Friday basically accepted what Democrats had called for since before Christmas. The President finished his remarks by saying if there's no deal by February 15 on a border wall, then he would use his powers to declare a national emergency, and move money around in the federal budget to build a wall. President Trump: \"I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government .\" --CSPAN (@ cspan) January 25, 2019 The announcement came on the 35th day of the partial government shutdown, which began before Christmas when the President rejected a plan which he had previously agreed to--a short term plan to keep the government open until February 8--sparking a standoff over funding for the President's plan to build a border wall. Democrats said the bottom line of the President's announcement was simple--President Trump had backed down, unable to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in the Congress to give him money for his border wall. \"After he said,\" re-open the government, \"I think everyone stopped listening,\" said Rep. Rick Larsen. \"This is a recognition by Pres Trump that his forced shutdown is hurting America and is the wrong way to try to change policy,\" said Sen. <mark>Jack Reed</mark> (D-RI). \"This is not a major legislative achievement, and the President should never have inflicted pain on America for 35 days, but this is a first step,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI). \"It's about damn time,\" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). As for Congressional Republicans, some quickly pointed the finger of blame at more conservative GOP lawmakers in the House, who pressed the President to force this shutdown fight. Senior R: \"I hope the president remembers this when the Freedom Caucus types tell him what to do next time. They only have a first move--start a fight. They never have a second move .\" --John Bresnahan (@ BresPolitico) January 25, 2019 \"It's long past time to open our government again,\" said Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), one of a group of more moderate Republicans who had expressed public disdain for the shutdown strategy. Just yesterday, the President had demanded a \"down payment' on a border wall in any short term funding deal--but that fell flat as well with Democrats. The only agreement the White House was able to get was that the House and Senate would proceed to negotiations on a bill to fund border security .\" Democrats don't usually remain this firm, but thanks to Pelosi, they did, \"said Democratic strategist <mark>Brian Fallon</mark>.\" And they won. \"Next Up:", "articleID": "2019012519_00398388_W", "names": {"Brian Fallon": ["Q2503485", "Q27656993", "Q4963711"], "Jack Reed": ["Q528979", "Q6114777", "Q6114779", "Q6114783"]}}, {"date": "2019-01-25", "url": "http://www.kob.com/news/analysis-trumps-shutdown-retreat-reveals-weakness/5223321/?cat=649", "content": "Analysis: Trump's shutdown retreat reveals weakness Donald Trump | Photo: AP By ZEKE MILLER January 25, 2019 07:22 PM WASHINGTON (AP)--President Donald Trump will emerge from the longest government shutdown in U.S. history politically weakened, his reputation questioned and his signature campaign promise still glaringly unfulfilled. Advertisement The 35-day partial shutdown over the president's demand for billions of dollars to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was, in the end, futile. Facing defections within his own party, sagging poll numbers and public criticism for interrupted services, the self-proclaimed master dealmaker accepted an agreement that he had previously spurned and set an ignominious record that will remain part of his legacy. Days after Trump marked the midpoint of his term, the shutdown highlighted the disquieting side effects of his unconventional governing style and the trials that lie ahead for him in dealing with emboldened Democrats. The folly of the effort was readily apparent inside the White House, where aides had warned Trump even before the shutdown began that there was no avenue to success in the showdown with Capitol Hill. Democrats ran for office on preventing Trump from building the wall--and it's hardly a popular idea even among Republican lawmakers. Advisers watched in shock as Trump declared in a December meeting with lawmakers that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government. And when he ultimately did just that, they feared the messaging war had already been lost. \"He was playing double-A ball against major leaguers,\" said former Republican Rep. <mark>Tom Davis</mark> of Virginia, who once headed the House GOP's campaign arm. By backing himself into the shutdown with no way out, <mark>Davis</mark> said, Trump displayed a lack of discipline from the start. The strategic deficit was only magnified by what allies saw as tactical errors. Trump spent the holidays tweeting from the White House rather than making public appearances to showcase his readiness to negotiate. He didn't deliver a public address or visit the border to make his case until weeks had already gone by. Perhaps most crucially, he underestimated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the unity of congressional Democrats, thinking the Californian would be more amenable to a deal on the wall once she won the speakership. Trump's message zigzagged sometimes by the hour. He maintained he was proud of shutting down the government and then tried to pin the blame on Democrats. One moment he signaled he was ready to concede the wall in favor of other barriers on the border, and the next he tweeted he was fighting for the wall as strongly as ever. It was emblematic of the dysfunctional White House culture he has fostered and the challenges that have been manifest on decisions big and small for two years. By the end of the shutdown, West Wing aides and outside allies of the president began to look at the seminal promise of Trump's 2016 campaign as an immense--and unachievable--burden on his presidency. It was complaints that Trump appeared to be passing up his last, best opportunity to make good on his build-the-wall pledge that led Trump into the shutdown to begin with. Conservative commentators and House Freedom Caucus members fired off warnings that Trump's base would sour on him if he didn't use the last days of unified GOP control of Washington last year to try to get money for the barrier. But in his quest to appease his base, the president tarnished his standing with the American public. Overall, 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job performance in a survey released this week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's down from 42 percent a month earlier and nears the lowest mark of his two-year presidency. \"Hopefully now the president has learned his lesson,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a gloating press conference with Pelosi. The impasse was an early test for Pelosi after her return to the speakership, one that she appeared to pass handily. Democrats remained unified against White House efforts to divide the caucus, and they head into the next round of debate over border security funding determined to make good on their own 2018 promises to block Trump's wall. As White House aides suggested that the shutdown had brought Democrats to embrace border \"barriers,\" Pelosi make clear her party remained resolved against the wall. \"Have I not been clear?\" she said. \"No, I have been very clear .\" Trump, characteristically, refused to concede that he'd conceded. Instead, he insisted he hadn't caved to Democrats, and he threatened yet another shutdown even while bemoaning the last one's impact on Americans. \"This was in no way a concession,\" Trump tweeted late Friday. \"It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it's off to the races!\" ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE: Zeke Miller has covered the White House and politics in Washington since 2011.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 26, 2019 at 10:46 AM Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has a three-step plan to drive same-store sales improvement in the United States. This includes enhancing the in-store experience, delivering beverage innovation, and driving digital relationships. Basically, the coffee chain wants to cut wait times in stores--especially during peak times--create new drinks or food items that entice consumers to either spend more or make an extra visit, and sign more people up for its loyalty programs. Those efforts are succeeding; the company is delivering 4% comparable-store sales growth in the U.S. \"We are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store transactions in the U.S., underpinned by our digital initiatives and improved execution of our in-store experience,\" said CEO <mark>Kevin Johnson</mark> on the first-quarter earnings release. Starbucks is working to take non-customer-facing work away from baristas. Image source: Starbucks. What is Starbucks doing? The chain's efforts to enhance the in-store experience focus on serving customers faster while continuing to build the connection between the consumer and in-store staff. To make that happen, Starbucks has been working to free up employee time to focus on customers. \"Our Starbucks store partners who proudly wear the green apron are at the center of connecting with customers and we are on a mission to support them by simplifying work and reducing some of the non-customer-facing tasks that historically have taken up to 40% of their time,\" said <mark>Johnson</mark> during the Q1 conference call. The changes made include shifting some cleaning tasks to after the stores have closed. in addition, Starbucks has automated \"product planning and replenishment which reduces store clutter and time away from customers .\" These changes will take multiple quarters to be fully implemented, but <mark>Johnson</mark> said that they are already paying off. \"Our customer connection scores continue to improve in Q1 on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. And importantly, across both, the morning and afternoon dayparts,\" he said. The company has also expanded its delivery pilot program. Ultimately, this should allow U.S. stores to increase comp sales, assuming the company can manage workflow to not impact in-store visitors. When it comes to beverage innovation, the company has focused on its cold drinks. <mark>Johnson</mark> said that cold beverages had gained momentum across multiple dayparts. \"The focus of our latest beverage innovation revolves around iced espresso, draft nitro beverages, and refreshers,\" he said. \"We have expanded the deployment of our nitro offering from about one-third of U.S. company-operated stores last quarter to 40% in just one quarter. And we remain on track to reach our goal of 100% penetration by the end of fiscal 2019 .\" Digital relationships, the third growth driver, have been increasing as well. The company has collected 13 million customer registrations from people who use its WiFi but are not Rewards program members. The chain also added 1 million members to its Starbucks Rewards program, a 14% increase that brings total membership to 16.3 million. \"This result was driven by leveraging our increased digital reach, as well as a more seamless customer onboarding experience, greater mobile order and pay adoption, and enhanced personalization features,\" said <mark>Johnson</mark>. \"Between digitally registered and active reward customers, we are now approaching 30 million digital connections in the U.S.\" Steady as she goes <mark>Johnson</mark> has shown that Starbucks can continue to grow sales in a mature market. He also has a clear plan to continue doing that, though it's important to note that he has largely backed away from his predecessor's plans to add premium products to up to 20% of stores. That plan hasn't gone away, but it has been scaled back into more of a test. In theory, that leaves the company with another potential growth driver in its back pocket once it exhausts its current three-tiered approach. Daniel B. Kline has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Starbucks. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Written by Ron Devlin Reading auto dealers had their motors revving full speed when the eight-day-long Third Annual Automobile Exhibition opened in the Bechtel Building at Fourth and Penn streets on Feb. 22, 1919, 100 years ago next month. World War I had ended three months earlier, and manufacturers and dealers were gearing up for returning soldiers. \"From four years of world-shattering war, with its consequent financial and economic disasters, the motor car emerges bigger, stronger, more useful and more appreciated than ever before,\" said a show advertisement in the Reading Times on Feb. 24, 1919. \"It comes now to the world in all its glory, with all the people bowing in acknowledgement to its achievements .\" The automobile industry contributed more than $600 million in munitions to the war effort, and was eager to get back to making cars. A shortage of 700,000 units was forecast, primarily because of shortages of steel and manpower during the war. The war had a positive effect on the development of the truck, the industry reported. French generals credited the versatility of trucks in delivering supplies and munitions to the battlefield with playing a critical role in winning the war. Schwartz Motor Truck Co., which built trucks at Pearl and Chestnut streets in Reading, promised better service and a complete line of parts in a Times ad. Industry development The Reading show committee reflected the broad development of the industry in Berks County. H.O. Keller of Reading Automobile Co. was president. Others included H. B. Schwartz of Schwartz Motor Co., A. N. Kline of Studebaker Co., H. G. Lutz of Fisk Tires and W. <mark>J.</mark> Memmert of Taylor Motor Garage Co.. America was undergoing major social and cultural change in post-World War I. Women, who would gain the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in August 1920, were behind the steering wheel in increasing numbers in 1919. \"Men must drive cars built for women,\" a Times story said. \"Men's pretense that the motor car is an intricate piece of machinery that a mere woman's untechnical mind can't understand is gone forever .\" Cars exhibited at the Reading show reflected the broader social change. They were more stylish, powerful and affordable. The Chandler, available at <mark>J. Miller</mark> Kalbach Co. in Reading, offered six body styles ranging in price from $1,795 to $3,095. \"Gracefully designed, splendidly furnished and upholstered, roomy and comfortable, it is a car of exceptional refinement,\" its ad bragged. Converted into headquarters Overland Harper Co had taken over the former Rajah Temple in the 500 block of Franklin Street and converted it into headquarters for sale of the Overland and Willys-Knight motor cars. The Daniels 8, built in Reading and sold by Reading Automobile Co., was featured at the show. Characterized as a distinguished luxury car with \"a little more power than you'll ever need,\" it was the brainchild of George E. Daniels. He would become the first president of General Motors and general manager of Oakland and Locomobile cars. The Standard 8 Hupmobile, available at C.C. Snyder in Reading, bragged that its two-speed sliding gear transmission would deliver \"no shifting of gears in traffic or on hills .\" Built with Standard Steel, is sold at a \"remarkable\" price of $2,750. Barbey Automobile Co. at Third and Spruce, \"the service station with a conscience,\" sold Exide batteries that were standard equipment in Cadillac, Pierce-Arrow, Hudson and Buick autos. Heydt Motor Car Co. would exhibited Hudson and Essex cars, seen in Reading for the first time. The 35 car and 11 truck models, which had economy to luxury price tags, were illuminated by large red, white and blue electric globes. The name of each car was displayed on the globe. The Specht Orchestra and Dusenberry's Jazz Band provided entertainment to the thousands who visited the show. The Reading Automobile Dealers Association, show sponsors, said it reflected all that had been learned in car building to date. \"The Reading show reflects what has been accomplished,\" an association ad in the Times said, \"notwithstanding the fact that the resources of the automobile industry have been diverted in the last few years to help winning the war .\" Contact Ron Devlin: 610-371-5030 or rdevlin @ readingeagle.com.

Related content Lawsuit: Utility caused wildfire that preceded mudslides (CNN) - Pacific Gas and Electric has filed for bankruptcy protection after coming under pressure from billions of dollars in claims tied to deadly wildfires. California's largest power company said in a statement Tuesday that it had submitted a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the Northern District of California. PG & E said it was committed to maintaining services for customers during the bankruptcy process. <mark>John Simon</mark>, the company's Interim CEO, said he would work \"to create a more sustainable foundation for the delivery of safe, reliable and affordable service .\" \"We have heard the calls for change and we are determined to take action throughout this process to build the energy system our customers want and deserve,\" he said in the statement. PG & E has been linked to a series of wildfires in California, including the Camp Fire, which caused 86 deaths and destroyed 14,000 homes, along with more than 500 businesses and 4,300 other buildings. PG & E announced on January 14 that it intended to file for bankruptcy, but it had to wait 15-day period required by California law. The company needs to use the bankruptcy process--which will allow it to shed some of its debt--to pay for damages and stay in business. PG & E said Tuesday it was seeking approval for a $5.5 billion debtor-in-possession financing agreement. Previously, it said in a filing that it has only about $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. The company has cited at least $7 billion in claims from the Camp Fire. It is believed that the Camp Fire was started when a PG & E power line came in contact with nearby trees. PG & E reported \"an outage\" on a transmission line in the area where the blaze began, about 15 minutes before it started. Within the massive burn area, PG & E found power equipment and a fallen power pole riddled with bullet holes, according to a letter it sent to regulators. The company also reported that it found a downed line with tree branches on it. In addition, a series of wildfires in 2017--many of which were also blamed on PG & E--caused $10 billion in damages and 44 deaths. In 11 of those fires, state investigators found the company violated codes regarding brush clearance near its power lines or had made related violations. Copyright 2019 by CNN NewSource.
