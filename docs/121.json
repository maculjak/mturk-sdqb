And it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East. Since then, <mark>Wright</mark> has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. Now, he has compiled his many New Yorker essays into a new book called The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State. But his interest in terrorism stretches back to well before his New Yorker job...back to a screenwriting gig in the 1990s. He tells NPR's Kelly McEvers that the 1998 film The Siege asked\" what would happen if terrorism came here? As it already had in, say, London and Paris, you know, how would we react if it happened in New York? \"Interview Highlights On people's reactions to The Siege after the Sept. 11 attacks It was the most rented movie in America after 9/11...I think there were two things--one was, it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end. On his piece about <mark>John O'Neill</mark>,\" The Counter-Terrorist \"If you recall, the planes were all grounded [after the attacks], and I lived in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days, and I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found <mark>O'Neill</mark>'s obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he'd been washed out of the [FBI] because he'd taken classified information out of the office. And then he wound up getting a job as head of security at the World Trade Center. You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center--they had bombed it once before in 1993--so he instinctively put himself at ground zero...it was <mark>O'Neill</mark> and a handful of people that really realized the peril that America was in. On the Americans held captive and killed by the Islamic State, and what might have been done differently I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive. Unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that, and also at the time opposed any Americans, even the parents of these individuals, paying to ransom their child. So essentially, the parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS, and they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI...there was rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way. On the relevance of al-Qaida in the age of ISIS Well, al-Qaida is the parent, with all the progeny that has multiplied all over the world. If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced--it's not extinct, but it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately. On how we've changed in America Well, I was reflecting about how, when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport, but it was where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place--we decided it must have been Paris--and we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack, and we pretended we were really cosmopolitan. And then we went up in the FAA tower,\" Come on in, kids! \"So we sat down and watched these airplanes land. And that was America. And I'm so struck, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. In Philadelphia, you go visit the Liberty Bell and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingements on ordinary liberty--the kinds of things we took entirely for granted, those are gone. But if they're forgotten they'll be permanently gone. And I think that it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom, and if we lose that, then I think terrorism really will have won. Copyright 2016 NPR.

SISAK and MICHAEL BALSAMOAssociated Press NEW YORK (AP) - The FBI and U.S. Inspector General's office will investigate how Jeffrey Epstein died in an apparent suicide Saturday, while the probe into sexual abuse allegations against the well-connected financier remain steadfast, officials said. Epstein, accused of orchestrating a sex-trafficking ring and sexually abusing dozens of underage girls, had been taken off suicide watch before he killed himself in a New York jail, a person familiar with the matter said. Attorney General <mark>William Barr</mark>, in announcing the investigation, said he was \"appalled\" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody. \"Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered,\" <mark>Barr</mark> said in a statement. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell Saturday morning at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Fire officials received a call at 6:39 a.m. Saturday that Epstein was in cardiac arrest, and he was pronounced dead at New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital. Epstein, 66, had been denied bail and faced up to 45 years behind bars on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges unsealed last month. He had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial. The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case. Epstein had been placed on suicide watch and given daily psychiatric evaluations after an incident a little over two weeks ago in which Epstein was found with bruising on his neck, according to the person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. It hasn't been confirmed whether the injury was self-inflicted or the result of an assault. Epstein was taken off suicide watch at the end of July, the person said. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that he had been housed in the jail's Special Housing Unit, a heavily secured part of the facility that separates high-profile inmates from the general population. Until recently, the same unit had been home to the Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is now serving a life sentence at the so-called Supermax prison in Colorado. Epstein's death raises questions about how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates. In October, Boston gangster James \"Whitey\" Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Saturday in a scathing letter to <mark>Barr</mark> that \"heads must roll\" after the incident. \"Every single person in the Justice Department - from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer - knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him,\" Sasse wrote. <mark>Cameron Lindsay</mark>, a former warden who ran three federal lockups, said the death represents \"an unfortunate and shocking failure, if proven to be a suicide .\" \"Unequivocally, he should have been on active suicide watch and therefore under direct and constant supervision,\" <mark>Lindsay</mark> said. Epstein's removal from suicide watch would have been approved by both the warden of the jail and the facility's chief psychologist, said Jack Donson, a former prison official who worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades. An attorney for Jeffrey Epstein, Marc Fernich, said in a statement that jailers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center failed to protect Epstein and to prevent the \"calamity\" of his death. Fernich also said that reporters, plaintiffs' lawyers and court officials \"should be ashamed of their behavior\" following Epstein's indictment last month. He said Epstein had \"long since paid his debt to society\" for his crimes. Epstein's arrest last month launched separate investigations into how authorities handled his case initially when similar charges were first brought against him in Florida more than a decade ago. U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned last month after coming under fire for overseeing that deal when he was U.S. attorney in Miami. On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein's ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself. Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre's attorney, said Epstein's suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed \"is no coincidence .\" McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said \"participated and facilitated Epstein's horrifying sex trafficking scheme .\" Other accusers and their lawyers reacted to the news with frustration that the financier won't have to face them in court. \"We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed the pain and trauma he caused so many people,\" accuser Jennifer Araoz said in a statement. <mark>Brad Edwards</mark>, a Florida lawyer for nearly two dozen other accusers, said that \"this is not the ending anyone was looking for .\" \"The victims deserved to see Epstein held accountable, and he owed it to everyone he hurt to accept responsibility for all of the pain he caused,\" <mark>Edwards</mark> said in a statement. Epstein's arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges. Federal prosecutors in New York reopened the probe after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over that plea bargain. His lawyers maintained that the new charges in New York were covered by the 2008 plea deal and that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his 13-month sentence in Florida. Before his legal troubles, Epstein led a life of extraordinary luxury that drew powerful people into his orbit. He socialized with princes and presidents and lived on a 100-acre private Caribbean island and one of the biggest mansions in New York. ___ Sisak reported from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Balsamo from Savannah, Georgia.

The 30-year-old Northeast Portland artist had been invited by her pastor's family to teach art at a Philippine orphanage. After the trip was postponed, however, Weaver was shocked to hear that a devastating typhoon had hit the Philippines, leaving more than 6,000 dead, millions homeless, and major logistical challenges for relief operations .\" I was glad I wasn't there but (I thought) there's something I can do, \"she recalls. So she set up a Facebook page to collect donations for her pastor's organization, Christian Frontier Ministries. Within 48 hours, her social media community was so supportive that the effort took on a life of its own. It turned into a group called Portland 4 the Philippines, a collaborative of artists, dancers, musicians, performers and other creatives who've produced three fundraising concerts so far and have a fourth scheduled for later this month. The events include lineups of at least five bands, spoken-word performances, art auctions, raffles and education in the form of updates, photos and blogs from contacts on the islands. The Portand creative community has embraced the effort .\" There's a definite family here. We're all really driven to do something with our arts that actually make a difference, \"says Joseph\" Djo \"Fortunato, a 34-year-old musician and visual artist who is one of three other co-organizers .\" We're all trying to survive off our arts, but everyone wants to have a purpose for it. \"Fortunato, who is half Filipino, grew up on the East Coast but has several hundred relatives in the Philippines and has been there twice for family reunions. He says he'd never thought much about the Filipino community in Portland before, but this tragedy has helped bring many of them together. The events have been family-friendly and affordable, with tickets on a sliding scale of $5 to $20. Local and international artists have donated their work for auction, and local venues and others have pitched in. The three events so far in December and January have raised more than $2,000. The fourth event (they set one in each quadrant of the city) is set for Jan. 25 at the Dublin Pub. Artists Colton Carnahan, Jessica Rose and Kenton Clow, 1000 Fuegos, Jordan Harris, <mark>Jesse James</mark> with Drake Carnahan, and Erick Valle are some of the acts set to perform. All of the proceeds are going to two on-the-ground charities in the Philippines that are focused on relief efforts .\" It's an opportunity to remind ourselves why we pick up an instrument, a paintbrush - which is to make the world a better place, \"Fortunato says. Long-term plans Raising money is just part of the goal. The group wants to keep a spotlight on the disaster for years to come, as the nation rebuilds. They plan to sponsor the extended recovery efforts, which Fortunato's uncle is helping to lead through his organization, Soft Power Philippines. That group formed after the earthquake that struck a month before the typhoon. They offer trauma counseling, education and sustainable materials to the disaster survivors as they rebuild their communities with a 21st century model. They want their efforts to be sustainable, not just a flash in the pan .\" This horrible tragedy creates the need and opportunity to build a better world, \"Fortunato says .\" It wouldn't have been as devastating if they would've planned better, and they know it. \"Most Americans would have a hard time comprehending the scale of the devastation, which has been called far worse than Haiti endured after its 2010 earthquake. That's why Tom Finch volunteered to help, despite not being an artist or a musician .\" It's forced me to confront my own Eurocentrism, that I need to open my eyes to more than just this Eurocentric paradigm, \"says Finch, 39, a longtime teacher at Portland Public Schools, on sabbatical this year.

british columbia pro-life researcher ted gerk appeared before a government committee today to call on the government to allow access to information relating to abortions performed in the province. the kelowna native, presenting to the special committee to review the freedom of information and protection of privacy act, called for the repeal of bill 21, an amendment to the province's freedom of information act that was enacted in 2001 by the ndp government to specifically exclude access to abortion information. as gerk told the committee, the bill \"created the amazing dilemma that i can know that my local hospital is providing abortion services, but i'm not allowed to know how many .\" in fact, as he pointed out, the abortion figures put out by statistics canada no longer include the number from b.c., and simply includes the note that the b.c. figure is \"too unreliable to be published .\" gerk charged that the amendment was enacted during a period when government was \"closely aligning themselves with political activists that lobby them on a regular basis,\" but \"then ensuring that information detailing that lobbying is never made public .\" the amendment, suggested gerk, was a way of covering up that information. prior to the passage of the amendment, information obtained through freedom of information, \"provided embarrassment after embarrassment directed toward the government and the bureaucracy,\" he added. through freedom of information requests, said gerk, he and fellow researchers were able to learn details about a special government committee called the abortion services working group, for example. they discovered that through this committee the ministry of health and the ministry of the attorney general were meeting with abortion-activist groups, and they also learned that freedom of information was a topic of discussion at these meetings. he mentioned, further, the discovery in the early 1990s that the b.c. attorney general had filed a false affidavit when he swore that he had not participated in a secret strategy meeting with abortion proponents. in 1996, said gerk, he and others discovered that the college of physicians and surgeons \"didn't even follow their own rules when it came to the accreditation of one of vancouver's abortion clinics .\" detailed in 2001, gerk was also able to discover, while investigating the death of a woman following an abortion at vancouver general hospital, that 15 babies had survived abortion between 1995 and 1998, but then died later. the amendment, gerk concluded, \"was put there, plainly and simply, because the government was tired of having to defend their abortion policies and activism. they were meeting with activists on one side of a public policy issue, all the while refusing to meet with those with a differing opinion .\" \"i didn't think it was too much to ask that we be allowed, in a democratic country, to monitor abortion advocacy being undertaken by our government and the bureaucracy,\" gerk observed. \"i mean, the same pro-choice groups that secretly met with government have called for a ban on any discussion about abortion and the formation of any pro-life groups, on university campuses!\" \"the public and media are surprised, now all these years later, at the travesty that foi has become in bc,\" gerk stated. \"i would submit that many of them failed to recognize that when you allow government to make any topic off limits, make it secret, you have in fact sown the seeds of secrecy...and how can you complain when it naturally expands to other areas?\" gerk and john hof, the president of campaign life coalition b.c., also called on the acting b.c. information and privacy commissioner, <mark>paul fraser</mark>, today to address this problem of abortion censorship. they presented him with 2,500 postcards signed by fellow british columbians. contact information: mr. <mark>paul fraser</mark>, qc office of information and privacy commissioner for british columbia po box 9038, stn. prov. govt. victoria, bc v8w 9a4 phone: (250) 387-5629 e-mail: study: 56% of young adults in a new sexual relationship infected with hpv liberal leader ignatieff slammed as \"extreme\" and \"divisive\" on abortion lawsuit filed challenging constitutionality of fed. hate crimes law canadian professors' union blacklists christian university over \"academic freedom\" poll: majority of americans wants us supreme court to reject gay \"marriage\" mcgill prof: quebec anti- \"homophobia\" plan is \"declaration of war\" u.k. gov' t backs down on equalities bill amendment following papal criticism chinese parents refuse simple life-saving treatment for daughter u.s. bishops' media director who exonerated exec admits to not reading key report planned parenthood board members in law, medicine teaching positions at jesuit u. the two lists: a former pro-choice atheist reflects on sex, abortion and anger congressman smith blasts abortion -

According to city campaign finance records, Arthur Dantchik, Joel Greenberg and Jeff Yass--heads of the trading firm Susquehanna International Group--have pumped almost $7 million into the American Cities super PAC, which backs state Sen. Anthony H. Williams (D). The total contributed by the three financial executives through May 4, the cutoff for the latest reports, not only dwarfs the amount spent by each candidate in the race, but also is nearly equal to all candidate and other super PAC fundraising combined. The contributions come amid a continued uptick in large campaign donations from financial investors to city, state and municipal elections sent through super PACs in recent years. The funds are largely given in support of market-based education reforms including the privatization of public schools, the diversion of public school funds to charter schools and the breaking of teachers unions .\" There is a trend right now toward increased outside spending on lower-ticket races, \"said Denise Roth Barber, managing director at the National Institute on Money in State Politics, a group tracking campaign finance at the state level. The $7 million contributed by just three individuals in the Philadelphia mayoral race stands out as one of the largest financial investments at the city level since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling opened the door for unlimited independent spending by corporations, unions and, ultimately, wealthy individuals. A super PAC that was largely funded by supporters of charter schools and school privatization spent $4 million in support of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's winning re-election campaign this year. A hedge-fund-backed group in New York that successfully helped elect a Republican state Senate majority in 2014 also spent $4 million. And in Newark's 2014 mayoral election, supporters of market education reform similarly spent $4 million in a losing campaign to elect a successor to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The Susquehanna International Group investors are major backers of these policies through their political and charitable donations, and as a staunch supporter of these types of policies, <mark>Williams</mark> is a perfect fit with these priorities. In the state Senate, <mark>Williams</mark> was the architect of an expansion of the state tax credit diverting public funds to charter schools by allowing corporations and wealthy individuals to be refunded with public money when they pay for a scholarship, or\" voucher, \"for a public school student to attend a charter school. He also served on the education commission created by former Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, a proponent of charter schools and vouchers. <mark>Williams</mark> is not a new commodity for the investors based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass spent at least $6 million through their Students First PA PAC to support <mark>Williams</mark>' bid for the Democratic Party's gubernatorial nomination in 2010. Susquehanna International Group did not respond to a request for comment from Dantchik, Greenberg, Yass or the company itself. Barbara Grant, a spokeswoman for the <mark>Williams</mark> campaign, said she could not comment on the prior connections between the campaign and the American Cities PAC donors, citing the ban on coordination between campaigns and super PACs .\" I can tell you what the senator has said for a very long time about his being influenced by the gentlemen who are the founders [of American Cities PAC], \"Grant said .\" And basically, he's said they have supported him for a long time and they've never asked him for anything except to advance the cause of good schools and good education for kids. \"Connections between <mark>Williams</mark> and the Susquehanna International Group donors are not limited to their contributions. <mark>Williams</mark>' campaign manager, Dawn Chavous, Chavous also founded a charity, Sky Community Partners, to take advantage of the tax credits for scholarships policy pushed by <mark>Williams</mark>. The Susquehanna International Group investors have given money to Sky Community Partners in exchange for tax credits under the program. Actually, Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass are, collectively, the largest users of the tax credit program. Not only do they give to Sky Community Partners, but they have also donated to Choice Academics, a charter charity run by Yass' wife, Janine. The tax credit program, which cost the state $127 million in 2014, has been plagued by a lack of oversight and criticized by Gov. <mark>Tom Wolf</mark> (D). According to a report on Philly.com, the state's Department of Community and Economic Development\" acknowledged that until 2012, it did not keep digital records for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of educational tax-credit applications filed on paper. \"The program also contains a loophole, according to Philly.com, allowing companies to sidestep the limit in the total amount of tax credits they can receive under the program in a given year by donating through affiliates or subsidiaries. This is precisely the practice used by the Susquehanna International Group. While Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass have a long history of supporting <mark>Williams</mark> in Democratic primary elections and have made bipartisan contributions for years, they are primarily backers of Republican Party politicians and groups promoting libertarian policies. They have contributed to national Republican Party committees, Corbett, Wisconsin Gov. <mark>Scott Walker</mark> (R) and Republican leaders such as former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va .). Large contributions have flowed to various committees set up by the Club for Growth. Most of the candidates they supported in recent elections are from the more libertarian wing of the party or the tea party. Yass contributed to the 2000 presidential campaign of Libertarian Party nominee Harry Browne and the Libertarian National Committee and also the Ralph Nader's 2004 independent presidential campaign. The trio has also donated to Democrats, including both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential nominating contest and Pennsylvania politicians such as then-Gov. Ed Rendell and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey. Democratic congressmen on key financial services committees have also received contributions. Dantchik, Greenberg and Yass have given contributions to Democratic Party committees as well, albeit on a smaller scale than to Republican groups. The three investors have also given millions of dollars to such nonprofits as the libertarian Cato Institute, the libertarian legal group Institute for Justice and the Ayn Rand Institute .\" They know they can't elect a Republican citywide in Philadelphia, and <mark>Tony Williams</mark> is the closest thing they can get, \"said Kati Sipp, director of Pennsylvania Working Families, a group backing <mark>Williams</mark>' opponent Jim Kenney in the mayoral race. Previous polling, both independent and by groups favoring individual candidates, showed a tight race between Kenney and <mark>Williams</mark>. An NBC 10 poll released on Thursday, however, gave Kenney a large lead and <mark>Williams</mark> in a tie for second with former District Attorney Lynne Abraham. Kenney has the backing of many of the city's largest unions including the teachers unions and national unions like the AFL-CIO, and those groups have contributed large sums to super PACs supporting his election, but not nearly to the level of the Susquehanna International Group. The union-supported Building a Better PA super PAC raised $1.5 million through May 4. Another pro-Kenney union group, Forward Philadelphia, raised $783,100 through the same date. Spending by all super PACs is expected to pick up in the final week of the campaign.

Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri called on young Muslim men in the United States and other Western countries to carry out attacks inside there and urged greater unity between militants. \"I call on all Muslims who can harm the countries of the crusader coalition not to hesitate. We must now focus on moving the war to the heart of the homes and cities of the crusader West and specifically America,\" he said in an audio recording posted online on Sunday, referring to nations making up the Western-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. He suggested Muslim youth in the West take the Tsarnaev and Kouachi brothers, who carried out the Boston marathon bombings and Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris respectively, and others as examples to follow. It was not clear when the recording was made but references to former Taliban leader Mullah <mark>Mohamed Omar</mark> as being alive suggest it is at least two months old. <mark>Omar</mark>'s death was announced by Afghanistan's government in late July. Zawahri reiterated his position on Islamic State, repeating what he said in a recording posted on Wednesday--that he viewed the group's claim to be a caliphate as illegitimate but would join them in fighting Western and secular forces in Iraq and Syria. Former Egyptian doctor Zawahri urged unity between Islamist militant factions in Syria and Iraq, where a Western-led coalition is bombing Islamic State targets, but recognized it would he be difficult. He called for the formation of an independent sharia court to settle disputes."}]
