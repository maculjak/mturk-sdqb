government department has demolished a group home at north goulburn for which it paid over $300,000. now the department of ageing, disability and home care (adhc) is building a replacement on the 6000 square metre property it owns at 24 common st to accommodate just two more people with disabilities. it will not reveal the cost of the new development, comprising four one-bedroom villas, a twobedroom villa, staff and common rooms, a sleepover facility, a carport and garaging, courtyard and garden area. the post three times asked its value, only to be told by a spokesperson the department would not be making any further comment. however she confirmed that adhc paid $307,000 for the former house and property in 2002. soon after, it was converted into four to five \"flats' for clients. the demolition and flurry of construction activity piqued councillors' interest at a recent meeting. planning director <mark>chris stewart</mark> advised that the department did not require council approval for the work. it was relying on the affordable rental housing state environmental planning policy, for which its department is the consent authority. the state government's ability to bypass council planning laws is nothing new. the council has raised concerns about this in the past, particularly where group homes' locations have generated community controversy. the department has also spent hundreds of thousands on group homes over the years, including $690,000 for a house in cunningham drive, tarlo in 2006. the spokesperson said adhc recently identified the common st facility as being\" outmoded and no longer suitable for residents' needs. \"\"a range of options were considered for this site and it was determined that the existing building could not be modified in a cost effective manner to meet these needs,\" she said. \"however the size, location and physical characteristics of the site made it suitable for redevelopment as modern accommodation for people with a disability .\" the refurbishments are expected to be ready by the end of this year. the complex will house six people. these clients have been moved to other accommodation in the meantime. the building would not result in closure of other group homes and demand for this type of housing was still strong in goulburn, the spokesperson said. \"this will be considered during planning for the southern highlands local planning area under the second phase of stronger together,\" she said. goulburn mp and community services minister pru goward could not comment on whether the rebuilding was value for money at this stage. she has asked for a report on the reconstruction and its cost, which she wouldn't receive until the end of the week. \"certainly there has been a lot of rebuilding of group homes because they require ramps and specialised facilities,\" ms goward said. \"the department may well have done an appraisal that found it was cheaper to rebuild than adapt the house .\" at the same time she believed the transition to group homes from institutionalised care had been a learning curve for all governments in terms of cost. \"our government's emphasis is on independent living because it's better for young people with disabilities and it's better for parents,\" she said. \"the only alternative for them when their parents are no longer able to look after them is nursing homes and i don't think that's good for anyone .\" 5 months at half price online only deals for the htc incredible s half price - 24 months massive deals on selected phones from vodafone get a

will come alive this weekend, as the trans-tasman baroque trio, latitude 37, perform a concert as part of chamber music of new zealand's 2011 kaleidoscopes season. wellington-born harpsichordist donald nicolson, 31, is a part of that trio, along with australians julia fredersdorff and <mark>laura vaughan</mark> on violin and viola da gamba. nicolson spent about eight years learning the harpsichord, a keyboard instrument. \"it sounds like 18th-century france,\" he says. taking music from 400 years ago and making it contemporary appeals to nicolson. \"there was something deeply emotional, and human about it,\" he says. he became interested in the instrument after his father rescued an old harpsichord from wellington's broadcasting house. he went to victoria university for four years, and then to the rock conservatorium in the hague, in the netherlands, for another four. while there, he studied with harpsichordist ton koopman, who he says was \"one of the godfathers of the harpsichord and early music movement. he influenced me very much .\" but although he came from a piano background, it was not until after 10 years of learning that he finally thought he was playing the way he wanted. \"it's all arts in a way. you're always practising, trying to keep getting better and find new ideas,\" he says. latitude 37 is a trio of performers, who were bought together through their love of dynamic performances of rock. they represent australia and new zealand combined, and this was where the name came from. latitude 37 is the latitudinal position linking melbourne to australia. the band formed in 2008 and this will be its second tour of new zealand. the band plans to wow southlanders on sunday at the civic theatre. \"i'm looking forward to it. i

tried not to think about what kind of effect they could do his career. but those thoughts were impossible for the ducks' top goaltender to keep out of his mind whenever he sat in the waiting room for the many appointments to diagnose and deal with the ailment that was affecting his head. as he proclaimed himself symptom-free on friday and fit for training camp next month, hiller talked about the mental strain he was under over the last three months of a potential vezina trophy-caliber season that was interrupted for good. \"normally i'm used to where if i want something really bad, i can just try a little harder and somehow i get there,\" hiller said from his off-season home in his native switzerland. \"and i think in this situation, it was frustrating for me. i was pushing and trying and trying. i couldn't just push and it was gone .\" it was kind of like a new situation for me. i don't think i was thinking that was it with my career or anything. but sure it's tough. you have a lot of time to think in not playing. in the doctor's office and waiting for the appointment, you have a lot time to think about that and what's going to happen and everything. \"i always tried to not think about it too much .\" hiller is certainly in a much better frame of mind these days as he reported that his on-ice training with swiss elite league club sc bern has gone well, noting that the intensity of practices has been similar to what he'd go through on a regular day with the ducks as \"they're starting the season pretty soon here so they're already getting game ready .\" though the real test of whether he's at full strength won't come until he's in camp and playing in the preaseason, hiller said he's at the point where he'd feel comfortable competing in game action. \"i haven't played games for quite a while now so i can't make any promises,\" he said. \"i'm feeling great in practice. i see the puck well and everything. i'm definitely looking forward to be back playing as soon as possible .\" after being shut down for good during the first-round playoff loss to nashville, hiller was ordered by the team to rest in a depature from the failed process to work through the symptoms. the fourth-year nhl goalie didn't do much outside of off-ice training until last month, either spending time at home or vacationing in hawaii with his girlfriend. on july 10, hiller finally returned to the ice as he took part in the camp run by his mentor, former ducks and current toronto maple leafs goaltending coach francois allaire. he acknowledged that he felt nervous but said he cleared that hurdle. \"i went back on the ice and felt pretty good right off the bat,\" he said. \"i had some better days and some days where i was a little so-so. but i never felt like i was off a lot .\" while he said he's progress to where \"i pretty much have to say i am where i used to be\" , hiller remains a bit frustrated that no definitive cause for his vertigo has been found even after visiting with doctors in switzerland where he felt more at ease talking to them in his native german tongue. \"i got some second opinions, but nobody could really exactly tell me where it was coming from,\" he said. \"everybody was saying it could be a few things, but nobody was really able to put their finger on it. it was frustrating, especially for the future. i wish i would know what exactly happened to prevent it from coming up again .\" i definitely hope it's a one-time thing. if it is, i don't really care what actually caused it. \"in hiller's absence, the ducks responded to the implosion of backup curtis mcelhinney by getting ray emery and <mark>dan ellis</mark>. both stabilized the club's goaltending and helped the club make the playoffs with emery ultimately starting five of the six postseason games against the predators. despite the strong performance by emery, the ducks decided not to re-sign the veteran in a sign that they were hopeful that hiller would be able to regain his spot at the lead goalie with the returning <mark>ellis</mark> as his backup. hiller gave the club the kind of news it wanted to hear, at least until he hits the ice when camp opens. you can

originated well outside the canaries' penalty area. john ruddy beat away the former ipswich captain's spot kick but barnett's straight red left <mark>lambert</mark>'s side undermanned when kenwyne jones rose highest to connect with glenn whelan's cross deep into stoppage time. \"it was at least three yards outside,\" said <mark>lambert</mark>. \"it was never a penalty in a million years. how he gave that - his positioning was so far behind it. the assistant seemed to give it .\" i've seen it since and it changed the game. it was a big, big decision and a major turning point. we looked comfortable with how we had started the game. \"it was bad enough getting himself sent off, but the actual contact, the initial contact, was outside. i think anywhere on the pitch it would be a free kick but it's a double hit with the penalty and the red card .\" it pushes you on the back foot against 11 men and you are up against a really good side, but the effort was excellent. he was the last man so he had to go. i think with 11 men we would have seen it through. i thought leon's general game was excellent but the contact was outside the box. when you go down to 10 men at this level it becomes really tough. \"<mark>lambert</mark> remained upbeat afterwards despite the late heartache .\" for us the disappointment is there not to have won the game, but i'm not too despondent about it because there was a big, big effort from everybody, \"he said .\" for the first home game i thought we played really well. i think we showed we could adapt. stoke are a really good side, who are difficult to play against. they got a terrific point against chelsea and then had a hard game in europe and got a great result there so we were under no illusions coming into this game. \"commitment-wise and effort-wise we gave as good we got. i can't ask for any more with how they played the game. i was delighted with a lot of aspects. it's a testament to our lads that we continued to hang in, even when we are on the back foot .\" <mark>lambert</mark> believes his men have already proved they are fast learners in the premier league after a brace of battling displays during the opening week of the new campaign. \"we've only played two games so lets not get carried away,\" he said. \"we'll certainly try everything we can to win football matches and that is what we'll try to do. i'm happy with how we have adapted so far. it's new to us and two years ago we were in league one\" that is the magnitude of it. it might take us time to adapt to certain things but we're in here on merit. it's not as if we're here by default. we have to have a level of performance that is very high. if you ask stoke, then we gave them a fright. \"ritchie de laet glanced home bradley johnson's inviting cross in a vibrant first half with fellow close season arrival anthony pilkington underlining his class in a wide left role .\" pilks was very good. he is coming back from a long term injury and i thought he played well, \"said <mark>lambert</mark>.\" he (de laet) was excellent i thought, just his all round game. he scored the goal and it just shows you how important set pieces are in the game. if you can defend them and score at the other end you'll do okay. audio optional - mp3 files only not a member yet? register to create your own unique pink un - norwich city football club news

former government insiders, western-leaning intellectuals, businessmen and even a smattering of ex-islamist militants. but they were united by one goal: to unseat muammar gaddafi. they won international recognition by forging a leadership council that espoused democracy. with gaddafi's regime on its last legs, the question now is whether the opposition can take over the plundered country and lead it effectively. the task of putting libya back together after six months of civil war and 42 years of gaddafi rule is all the more difficult because the nation has no experience at the ballot box or with democratic institutions. gaddafi ran the country according to his whims and idiosyncratic political philosophy. and he brooked no dissent. \"the rebels want a libya reconciled with itself, that is democratic, whatever that may mean,\" said george joffe, a libya expert at cambridge university. \"but the way in which they're going to do that isn't clear ....there are absolutely no basic structures they can use .\" without any practical experience to fall back on, the council has done an imperfect job of managing the territory under rebel control since the uprising began feb. 15, when youth activists started protesting in benghazi. as the demonstrations spread and the revolt gained steam, more experienced hands rushed to join the movement and fill the leadership void. eventually, the rebellion formed the national transitional council. members are representatives from each rebel-held city, and are selected by similar local councils. heading the ntc is mustafa abdul-jalil, a pious former justice minister who joined the rebels in the uprising's first high-level defection. despite past links with the gaddafi regime, he enjoys the respect of broad swaths of the rebel public for his criticism while minister of the tight control of security forces. but he is not considered a strong leader or a dominating personality. abdul-jalil is one of several former regime members who make up a powerful bloc on the council. the group includes the head of the rebels' acting cabinet, mahmoud jibril, as well as the rebels' chief diplomat, ali al-essawi. jibril, educated at the university of pittsburgh, helped draw up ambitious visions for the future. one of them, titled \"libya 2025: a look ahead,\" called for a restricted role for the state, free expression and the opening of the free market. past efforts inside gaddafi's government have earned former regime members respect in rebel-ruled eastern libya. they say they strive to create a democratic state, but they are not natural politicians, and the long periods many spent abroad make them distant figures. the movement also has sought help from libyans who have returned from exile eager to play a role in the nation's rebirth. chief among them is ali tarhouni, a straight-talking economics professor who left his teaching job at the university of washington to become finance minister in the rebel cabinet. the rebellion has also found space for islamists, including former members of the libyan islamic fighting group, a radical islamist organization that staunchly opposed gaddafi. some high-ranking officials in the rebel security apparatus and military have backgrounds in the group. some divisions have already emerged in the rebel camp, which could expand if gaddafi falls. joffe said the national council's relationship with libya's berber minority in the western nafusa mountains is unclear. the berbers have spearheaded the offensive on tripoli, as well as the uprising in the western port city of misrata that played a central role in the war. \"we don't know whether they'll be prepared to accept leadership of the council\" down the road, he said. \"there are tensions between the islamists on the one hand and the exiles on the other, and there are even divisions among the exiles themselves. there is no obvious leader yet, and that alone is a problem .\" the ntc was on the brink of collapse as recently as late july, with the killing of military chief abdel-fattah younis. younis was a highly divisive figure who served as gaddafi's interior minister until he defected to the rebellion early in the uprising, bringing his forces into the opposition ranks. his move raised hopes among rebels and western allies that the uprising could succeed. but some rebels remained deeply suspicious that he retained some loyalties to the dictator. his body was found dumped outside benghazi, along with two of his aides. the rebel leadership has insisted the assassination was the work of the gaddafi regime, but several witnesses say younis was killed by fellow rebels. the slaying has fueled concerns about unity within the rebel movement, as well as the ntc's ability to impose discipline on the units nominally under its control. it sacked the cabinet in the wake of the killing, and has failed to name a new one. regardless of its failings, the ntc is the only political organization in the rebel camp that has the potential to step in after gaddafi, and the west has pledged to unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen libyan assets to help the council put libya on a new path. for now, gaddafi's regime remains, albeit weakened, and fighting continued monday in tripoli and on other fronts. the rebels on the battlefield remain focused on finishing the job, but also say they are keeping their eyes on the future .? copyright 1999 - 2011 independent online, a division of independent newspapers (pty) limited. the copyright in the literary and artistic works
