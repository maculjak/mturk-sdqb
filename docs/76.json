The views of charity and social enterprise bosses have been revealed in the latest Ulster Bank and CO3 3rd Sector Index. Published by CO3 Chief Officers 3rd Sector, the report is a key barometer of Northern Ireland's third sector, involving a quarterly survey of CO3 members, who include the leaders of some of Northern Ireland's largest charities and social enterprises. Services they provide range from care, to counselling and support, as well as training and development. A total of 65% of respondents believe that political instability in Northern Ireland will worsen over the year ahead and almost two-thirds expect the Northern Ireland economy to deteriorate over the same period, an increase on the previous quarter (61%). As fears for the economy and political instability continue, almost three quarters (72%) of third sector leaders advocate for a shift in the political decision-making process. While opinion is mixed, only 24% believe in maintaining the status quo, opting for civil servants to make decisions about Northern Ireland in the absence of a Stormont Executive. Overall, third sector leaders believe the responsibility for making decisions about Northern Ireland should fall with the Secretary of State (27%), a joint British-Irish intergovernmental conference (25%) or a Citizens' Assembly (20%). One respondent to the survey said: \"Having no decision makers, having no decisions being made, having civil servants who are afraid to commission anything new and being stuck in contracts that are out of date, under paying us and undervaluing us is frustrating and leaving us unable to have much flexibility in responding to the needs of our groups .\" Despite the uncertain environment though, respondents say that their organisations continue to increase employment and remain optimistic that turnover will increase. The latest report shows an increase in employment levels to deal with an increasing demand for services, with 33% of organisations increasing their headcount in the past quarter, the highest rate of increase over the previous 12 months. This comes as organisations are once again reporting continued increases in demand for their services (67%). As a result, 74% expect their turnover to increase or remain the same. Nora Smith, Chief Executive of CO3, said: \"Once again, the political situation in Northern Ireland remains a key concern for third sector organisations and one which they don't expect to improve. Our latest report demonstrates that the lack of a government is impacting on the sector however the resilience of organisations is also apparent. What is clear is that the third sector needs government decisions to be made and the majority feel that the current situation where decisions aren't being made is unsustainable .\" <mark>Richard Ramsey</mark>, Chief Economist, NI, at Ulster Bank added: \"Despite no shortage of political uncertainty, the Northern Ireland economy has been resilient in the past year, with private sector activity continuing to increase and labour market statistics posting a number of records of the positive variety. The latest Ulster Bank and CO3 Third Sector Index suggests that this is being reflected in the third sector where despite issues being created by a lack of decision-making including in relation to funding, third sector organisations report that they are seeing growing demand and are increasing their headcount. Whether this is sustainable in a situation where political stalemate continues and the economy as a whole feels the increasing squeeze of rising inflation and stagnant wages remains to be seen .\" (MH/LM) Charity Leaders Raise Concerns Over Ongoing Political Instability Charities and social enterprises in Northern Ireland are concerned about politically instability and believe action is needed to ensure decisions can be made in the absence of an Executive.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner) Zika is still a threat, Pennsylvania officials remind travelers (...) Andre Penner A female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the Aedes aegypti is a vector for transmitting the Zika virus. (AP Photo/Andre Penner) If you are heading to a warm destination for vacation, state and federal health officials would like to remind you that Zika is still out there. Yes, college students getting ready for spring break travel should know that the virus linked to serious birth defects hasn't gone away. The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention & Control still has a travel alert for places where mosquitoes could spread the virus to people--a list that includes parts of Florida and Texas, as well as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and nearly all of central and south America. Pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to those areas, the CDC says, and all travelers should take extra precautions against mosquito bites both during the trip and three weeks after returning, to avoid spreading the virus. Because the virus can also be transmitted sexually, the CDC also counsels travelers to avoid unprotected sex with a woman who is or may become pregnant for at least six months after being in a Zika-infected region. State officials are reminding potential travelers to be cautious. \"The threat of the Zika virus exists in every part of the state due to global travel,\" said Nate Wardle, the emergency preparedness public information officer a the state Department of Health, which has been \"using social media to reach students and their families to urge the importance of education and awareness about Zika, the dangers and how to protect oneself .\" The CDC recently estimated that Zika made certain types of birth defects 20 times more likely in the U.S., with a previous rate of 3 per 1,000 births rising to 60 per 1,000 births among mothers who had contracted the virus. One of those defects is microcephaly, which is characterized by abnormally small heads and brains. Mosquito transmission hasn't been documented in Pennsylvania yet, but to date department data shows 177 confirmed cases of Zika since the state started tracking them last year, and 32 probable ones. The department doesn't provide local details on those cases, but as of November local health officials said 12 pregnant women in Lancaster County had Zika and there had not yet been any reports of associated birth defects. Updates on county cases and their outcomes were not available this week. In the continental U.S., the CDC says there have been 5,109 cases of Zika in the states, including 1,143 in pregnant women that resulted in 47 babies born with birth defects and 5 pregnancy losses with birth defects. And in Puerto Rico--which has strong ties to the Lancaster area--the CDC says there have been nearly 37,000 cases, and information on pregnancy outcomes is not yet available. Locally, a type of mosquito thought capable of spreading Zika but not likely to do so was found in Lancaster County last year, but Millersville University professor <mark>John Wallace</mark> said that at this point, he doesn't think people need to worry about Zika if they're not traveling outside Pennsylvania. The warm winter here has pushed mosquito season earlier, <mark>Wallace</mark> said, with some flying around now. \"Wear repellent and light-colored clothing; reduce mosquito habitat,\" he said.

The rally followed a meeting where policy makers mentioned the need to boost domestic demand for the first time since 2015, and dropped a reference to deleveraging. Government bonds, which had been rallying at the fastest pace since 2008, declined. It's a change for China's equity investors, where virtually nothing worked only days ago. A $1 trillion rout had left banks and other onshore giants flirting with a bear market, while foreign-listed tech was having its worst start to a year since 2013, and previously profitable Wall Street strategies tracking the cheapest stocks or biggest dividend payers had all but unraveled. Even small caps, which enjoyed a brief moment in the sun in March, had resumed a multiyear rout. \"The Politburo meeting sends a signal that China may roll out fiscal stimulus and supportive monetary policies to resolve financial risk and stabilize markets,\" said <mark>Ken Chen</mark>, a Shanghai-based analyst with KGI Securities Co. \"That has boosted sentiment on the market, especially for blue chips .\" Bulls returned in full force Tuesday, at one point sending the FTSE China A50 Index toward its biggest daily gain since 2016. All industry groups on the broader CSI 300 Index rose, with property developers and banks leading gains. Even tech rebounded from a two-day slump. Firms tied to materials advanced as strength in cement companies outweighed declines for aluminum makers. While the rally helped patch some of the damage inflicted on Chinese stocks this year, the country's benchmarks are still among the world's worst performers since their January peaks. For Bocom International Holdings Co.'s Hao Hong, onshore equities are still going through a volatile period, with valuations, a slowing economy and limited inflation pressure tipping the balance in favor of bonds. \"The general trend for the stock market is down,\" he said. \"If you were buying Chinese banks for their dividend yield, then you might as well buy Chinese government bonds .\" The gap between dividend yields and bond yields has been watched by investors after the Shanghai Composite Index's best start to a year in a decade made stocks pricey relative to government debt. That spread widened again Tuesday. Hints from the Politburo meeting suggest policy makers are well aware of what's been causing market jitters. A trade spat with the U.S. has added another layer of uncertainty to an economy already grappling with the effects of the government's goal to curb leverage and reduce risk in the financial sector. The shift in tone is \"a sign that China is paying attention to the downward pressure in the economy,\" <mark>Han Wang</mark>, chief macro analyst at Industrial Securities Co., wrote in a note Tuesday. \"This would cushion part of investors' worries about the economy due to trade concern and would boost the risk appetite of the market .\" --With assistance by Amanda <mark>Wang</mark>, and

- mali's efforts to escape a post-coup crisis faced further upset wednesday after key political parties called for the prime minister to resign days before a deadline to form a new unity government. interim prime minister cheick modibo diarra has until july 31 to formulate a unity government which regional mediators demanded to deal with the deepening hold of hardline islamists on the north, which they occupied four months ago. but as diarra--an astrophysicist and american citizen--cobbles together this new regime, a grouping of key political parties and civil society organisations on tuesday demanded he step down. \"three months after its formation, the transition government led by cheick modibo diarra has only become bogged down in incompetence and amateurishness and mali is only sinking deeper,\" the united front for the defence of the republic and democracy (fdr) said in a statement. the fdr criticised his roadmap to escape the post-coup crisis as being vithout vision and \"clearly concocted under the pressure of events and in which the burning priorities of the nation are scarcely in evidence\". the grouping notably accused diarra of having \"no strategy to free, through war or negotiation\" the north of the country. one of the parties in the fdr is the malian democratic alliance, whose leader is president of the transition government dioncounda traore. <mark>traore</mark> has been in paris for two months after being violently mobbed in his office by opponents to his appointment. \"indeed, the ship is pitching,\" said an african diplomat based in bamako on condition of anonymity. \"we are a number of countries in the sub-region who have observed the current transition government is struggling to resolve urgent problems .\" armed islamist groups which security experts say are acting under the aegis of al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb, took advantage of a power vacuum after the march 22 coup to seize an area larger than france. since the formation of the 12-month transition government, the islamists have only deepened their hold, implementing strict sharia law and destroying ancient world heritage sites in the city of timbuktu. the occupation has also led to the displacement of some 400,000 malians, more than half of which are living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries, according to the un refugee agency. while diarra's interim government's main task was to solve the northern crisis, it has made no headway. the economic community of west african states (ecowas) ordered them to form a unity government uniting disparate political forces by july 31 or face suspension from the bloc. ecowas wants to send a 3,000-strong military force to mali, but is waiting for united nations approval and a formal request from bamako. \"it is up to the malians to decide who must be their prime minister and the make up of their government,\" a source within the mediation team in burkina faso told afp. he added that mediators want <mark>traore</mark> back in bamako by july 31. in paris ivory coast leader and current ecowas chief alassane ouattara is due to meet french president francois hollande on thursday as west africa's biggest crisis looms large. regional heads of state will meet in abidjan on wednesday to examine a report by military experts who carried out an \"audit\" of the foundering malian army to determine its needs. \"the situation in mali is getting worse every day,\" ivorian army chief soumaila bakayoko said at a ceremony opening the abidjan meeting. diarra, who worked for the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) and was also the microsoft chairman for africa, is the son in law of <mark>moussa traore</mark> who became president of mali after ousting a previous regime and ruled for 23 years until 1991. many in mali see him as too close to the former putschists led by amadou sanogo, who has remained influential despite handing power over to a civilian government and has been accused of meddling in political affairs. 25-07-2012 top rights lawyer praises senegal \"turnaround' in habre case 25-07-2012 rawlingses express condolences to mills' family 25-07-2012

Share: FULL STORY Scientists at Scripps Research have developed a method for rapidly discovering potential cancer-treating compounds that work by resurrecting anti-tumor activity in immune cells called T cells. advertisement Cancerous tumors often thrive because they render T cells dysfunctional or\" exhausted. \"The new method uncovers medicinal compounds that can restore the function of these T cells, making cancers vulnerable to them again. The approach, described in a study published in Cell Reports, may also help restore T-cell responses to persistent infections from viruses or other pathogens. It therefore should speed the development of new cancer and infectious-disease immunotherapies, including those that can be combined with existing immunotherapy drugs to enhance their effects. The scientists demonstrated the potential utility of the approach by using it to rapidly screen a collection of more than 12,000 drug compounds--uncovering 19 that can reawaken exhausted T cells .\" This new screening method should be particularly useful because we can use it not only to identify compounds that restore needed function to exhausted T cells, but also to quickly analyze these T cells to determine how these compounds work on them, \"says senior author Michael Oldstone, MD, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research. The new screening system--and to some extent, the wider field of cancer immunotherapy--is based in part on research over the past several decades by Oldstone's laboratory and several former lab members including Rafi Ahmed, <mark>David Brooks</mark>, and John Teijaro, along with other scientists that have conducted animal-based research on how the immune system responds to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). A unique variant of LCMV known as\" clone 13 \"establishes a persistent infection by exhausting the virus-specific T cells that are required to clear the infection. It does this by boosting signals through T-cell receptors such as PD-1 and IL-10. The discovery that LCMV clone 13 can survive by switching off anti-LCMV T cells was quickly followed by the recognition that cancers often persist using the same trick. advertisement Immunotherapies that block signaling from PD-1 or similarly acting receptors to restore T cells' anti-cancer responses are among the most powerful cancer medicines available today. These therapies save many patients who in the past had seemingly untreatable tumors. But because treatment with these drugs typically works well for only a few cancers, including melanoma--and less often on other cancers--scientists suspect that cancers usually hijack multiple inhibitory T-cell pathways. This suggests that a combination of immunotherapies directed to different molecular pathways could be more effective than the current therapy .\" The idea now is to develop more immunotherapy drugs and find the best combinations of them, \"Oldstone says. A promising hit The new screening system is designed to enable scientists to swiftly find such drugs--in this case, pharmacologically active small-molecule compounds that might work better than, or augment, the current injectable antibody immunotherapies now available. The system uses T cells that have been exhausted by LCMV clone 13 and detects signs of renewed activity in these cells when a tested compound works to reawaken them. An advantage of the new screening system is that it is specific and highly automated; thus, thousands of compounds can be tested within days, with the\" hits \"verified in experiments involving mice. Oldstone and colleagues applied the new screening system to a drug repurposing library of more than 12,000 compounds that either are FDA-approved or have been tested as potential drugs. They quickly identified 19 hits--compounds that, at modest doses, can effectively resurrect the activity of exhausted T cells. One of these compounds, ingenol mebutate, is a plant-derived molecule that is already used in gel form (Picato) to treat actinic keratosis, a pre-cancerous skin condition. The researchers employed elements of their screening system to study the reactivated T cells and determined that ingenol mebutate restores function for these cells largely by activating signaling enzymes called protein kinase C enzymes, a known pathway of activity for this compound. Co-first authors of the study, postdoctoral fellows Brett Marro, PhD and Jaroslav Zak, PhD, in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology, are currently collecting and exploring the therapeutic potential of other reported hits that may work in combination with treatments that block PD-1 - and another T-cell-inhibitory receptor, CTLA-4. Indeed, one such hit in combination with antibody to PD-L1 is already undergoing evaluation in patients. Oldstone notes that the new screening approach is flexible enough to adapt for finding compounds that have other effects on T-cells, such as reducing T-cell activity to treat autoimmune conditions. make a difference: sponsored opportunity Story Source:"}, {"articleID": "2009080206_00022892_W", "names": {"Chris Anderson": ["Q19609580", "Q2536856", "Q29051924", "Q30121842", "Q40360340", "Q4065282", "Q5105727", "Q5105729", "Q5105730", "Q706222", "Q943061"], "John Morris": ["Q19276793", "Q19325579", "Q203188", "Q21501583", "Q24844367", "Q3048680", "Q48744064", "Q53774610", "Q54635355", "Q56036931", "Q6249470", "Q6249477", "Q6249486", "Q6249491", "Q6249494", "Q6249495", "Q6249496", "Q6249497", "Q931890", "Q958669"]}, "date": "2009-08-02", "url": "http://newsobserver.com/105/story/1035261.html", "content": "there are two surefire, easy-to-spot signs of a downtown's cultural vitality: places to see art and the prevalence of bicycles. the art clearly means creativity, and bikes mean people live in the city's center, or nearby, and are probably headed somewhere interesting. both benchmarks are celebrated in an informal art tour called bike first friday, which began in april 2007 when victor lytvinenko, a jeans designer, celebrated his fiancee's birthday by inviting friends on a bicycle parade. it grew each month and now draws as many as 60 riders. \"in a way, we're making a statement that it's a lot easier getting around downtown on bikes than to drive,\" lytvinenko said. raleigh cultural blogs have begun showing up like renovated buildings downtown. along with local blogs that cover a lot of ground--politics, urban planning, neighborhoods, personal diaries--about half a dozen blogs report exclusively on the cultural changes going on. together, they are defining a city that is still trying to figure out what it's going to be when it grows up. typical of blogs, they are often quicker than print media. but unlike many such sites, these have not attracted hysterical rants and unchecked rumors. www.dtraleigh.com). most of them showed up after the suspension last summer of raleighing (raleighing.com), a boosterish site that seems to have been the first to regularly document the downtown transformation, and at its peak had 3,000 regular readers each day, according to creator <mark>chris anderson</mark>. \"when it stopped, everyone said\" hey, i can do that,' \"said photo blogger <mark>john morris</mark> of goodnight, raleigh!\" a lot of people saw an opening when that site shut down. \"food and tunes if on a friday night you find yourself at the north end of downtown in that interesting little pocket near peace college called seaboard station, it might be a pleasant surprise to encounter free music to accompany your dinner or drink al fresco. capital city grocery, owned by a partnership of people who live nearby, will have mellow tunes every friday evening through september. there is seating for 40 and room to stand on the store's patio. a sandwich, salad or prepared meals to go can be enjoyed with a beer or a glass of wine. pam letendre, one of the store's managers, says the vibe is family-friendly. an art gallery and three restaurants are nearby. rickshaw, anyone? here's how it all ties together: say you've had a bite to eat in seaboard, it's too far to walk to other galleries, and you like the benefits of cycling but don't have a bike. your answer is the rickshaw. every night, 16 pedal-powered carriages range from cameron village to mordecai. there's no fare but drivers wouldn't mind a tip, maybe a buck or so a block. they've been plying the boulevards since april 2007, and the number of rickshaws has been more than doubled because of the demand on first fridays. there is also a free trolley on first fridays. the news & observer is pleased to be able to offer its users the opportunity to make comments and hold conversations online. however, the interactive nature of the internet makes it impracticable for our staff to monitor each and every posting. since the news & observer does not control user submitted statements, we cannot promise that readers will not occasionally find offensive or inaccurate comments posted on our website. in addition, we remind anyone interested in making an online comment that responsibility for statements posted lies with the person submitting the comment, not the news and observer."}]
