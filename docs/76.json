"content": "new york - charlie manuel was well aware of the streak, the one that finally ended when roy halladay (of all people) crossed home plate in the third inning saturday night. \"it was 38 innings, but we put one across,\" a smirking manuel said. frank franklin ii / associated press so he was keeping track? \"four games plus two innings,\" he said. \"even i can count that far .\" now they can joke about it. the phillies beat the mets, 4-0, in the process of snapping a scoreless stretch at citi field. new york helped the cause with three errors that led to three unearned runs. and on the day chase utley began his rehab 1,000 miles south, the phils moved back to within two games of the first-place atlanta braves. on saturday, halladay played the familiar role of stopper as the importance of a single game increases. that's an unusual feeling for halladay. he's pitching in a pennant race for the first time since his rookie season. \"it's going to be fun,\" halladay said. \"this is obviously the biggest reason i wanted to play here .\" in addition to notching the team's first hit of the night - as well as the game's first run - halladay pitched eight shutout innings. his season era is 2.24, third-best in the majors behind only <mark>adam wainwright</mark> and tim hudson. the hit elicited a smile from manuel and some dugout chatter, the manager said. halladay might be on the most modest five-game hitting streak ever. \"he finally hit the grass tonight, didn't he?\" manuel quipped. \"i haven't gotten too many out of the infield,\" halladay said. \"i'll take it .\" on the mound, halladay was dominant. immediately after he plated the first run, halladay surrendered a leadoff triple to <mark>jose reyes</mark>. he never advanced. angel pagan hit a 93 m.p.h. fastball weakly to third for the first out. <mark>david wright</mark> whiffed on a dastardly curveball for strike three. on the sixth pitch to the next hitter, <mark>carlos beltran</mark>, halladay threw the same knee-bending curve. it elicited the same response: <mark>beltran</mark> swung and missed. \"my command was better,\" halladay said. \"i didn't have as many balls over the plate .\" the one run was enough for halladay, but he had breathing room courtesy of new york's sloppy defense. in the fifth, raul ibanez hit a grounder to second that could have been a double play. but ruben tejada threw wildly to second, which allowed <mark>jimmy rollins</mark> to score. in the sixth, <mark>wright</mark> let a slow grounder go between his legs. instead of the inning ending, two more phillies runs scored and the boos rained down on <mark>wright</mark>. \"i don't think you're going to win too many games making three errors,\" <mark>wright</mark> said. \"when you have [halladay] on the mound, you know you're going to have to play pretty perfect baseball to beat him and we were far from that tonight .\" manuel denied halladay the chance for his ninth complete game of the season, which would have tied his total from all of 2009. having thrown 113 pitches in eight innings and the phillies comfortably holding a four-run lead, the manager decided his ace had done enough. manuel said he is monitoring halladay, who leads the majors in innings, more closely than before. halladay, for his part, said he is ready for a heavy workload down the stretch. \"today and the last couple of times i felt strong,\" he said. \"it's just a matter of maintaining that. the closer you get to the end of the season and you're in it, you get a little boost .\" after the game, manuel, relaxed by halladay's standard performance, sat back in his office chair in a jovial mood. his team is coming together at the right moment. when asked a question about ryan madson's shaky ninth inning, manuel began to answer. then he stopped. \"don't forget,\" he said, \"utley had a triple .\" confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to report abuse confirm your registration to

quarter of country flooded; ban urges speedy assistance by chris brummitt - aug. 16, 2010 12:00 am islamabad, pakistan - u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said sunday that he has never seen anything like the flood disaster in pakistan after surveying the devastation and urged foreign donors to speed up assistance to the 20 million people affected. ban's comments reflect the concern of the international community about the unfolding disaster in pakistan, which is battling al-qaida and taliban militants, has a weak and unpopular government and an anemic economy propped up by international assistance. \"this has been a heart-wrenching day for me,\" ban said after flying over the hard-hit areas with pakistan president asif ali zardari. \"i will never forget the destruction and suffering i have witnessed today. in the past, i have witnessed many natural disasters around the world, but nothing like this .\" ban visited myanmar after cyclone nargis devastated the country in may 2008, killing an estimated 138,000 people. he also flew to china's sichuan province just days after an earthquake that killed nearly 90,000 people in march 2008. the floods that began more than two weeks ago in pakistan's mountainous northwest have now hit about one-quarter of the country, especially its agricultural heartland. while the death toll of 1,500 is relatively small, the scale of the flooding and number of people whose lives have been disrupted is staggering. the world body has appealed for an initial $460 million to provide relief, but only 20 percent has been given. once the floods recede, billions more will be needed for reconstruction and getting people back to work in the already-poor nation of 170 million people. the international monetary fund warns that the floods could dent economic growth and fuel inflation. \"waves of flood must be met with waves of support from the world,\" ban said. \"i'm here to urge the world to step up assistance .\" zardari has been criticized for his response to the disaster, especially for going ahead with a state visit to europe just as the crisis was unfolding. zardari has visited victims twice since returning, but images of him at a family-owned chateau while in france are likely to hurt him for months to come. in his first comments to the media since returning, he defended the government. \"the government has responded very responsibly,\" he said, saying the army, the police, the navy and officials were all working to relieve the suffering. \"i would appeal to the press to understand the magnitude of the disaster .\" zardari said it would take up to two years for the country to recover. ban said visa restrictions had been eased for humanitarian workers, and they now could get visas on arrival at pakistan airports. on saturday, prime minister yousuf raza gilani said that 20 million people had been made homeless in the disaster. the monsoon rains that triggered the disaster are forecast to fall for several weeks yet, meaning the worst may not yet be over. over the weekend, tens of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes when they were inundated by fresh floods from the swollen indus river. while local charities and international agencies have helped hundreds of thousands of people with food, water, shelter and medical treatment, the scale of the disaster has meant that many millions have received little or no assistance. the u.n. has voiced fears that disease in overcrowded and unsanitary relief camps may yet cause more deaths. earlier sunday, survivors fought over food being handed out from a relief vehicle close to the town of sukkur in hard-hit sindh province, ripping at each others' clothes and causing such chaos that the distribution had to be abandoned, according to an associated press reporter at the scene. \"the impatience of the people has deprived us of the little food that had come,\" said <mark>shaukat ali</mark>, a flood victim waiting for food. waters 5 feet deep washed through dera allah yar, a city of 300,000 people on the border of sindh and baluchistan provinces, government official salim khoso said. about 200,000 had fled the city, and khoso said he did not know how they would be fed.", "articleID": "2010081608_00005792_W", "names": {"Shaukat Ali": ["Q56274761", "Q56705910", "Q7490758", "Q7490759"]}}, {"date":

did property journalists mislead investors? views on bg | august 22, 2010, sunday did property journalists mislead investors? photo by www.independent.co.uk irish investors who claim they were misinformed may sue journalists, says <mark>matthew bell</mark> the independent if the british property market resembles a shrivelling party balloon, in ireland it looks more like the aftermath of the hindenburg disaster. the bubble that started growing in the 1990s and accelerated out of control after 2002, when ireland joined the euro, eventually burst spectacularly in 2008, and has yet to show any signs of recovery. since the crash, those who lost a fortune or who have been left with unsellable property have been looking for someone to blame. now a hate figure has emerged in the form of the property journalist. although a case has yet to be lodged, a number of aggrieved investors are said to be consulting dublin lawyers about launching a case against certain journalists who, they believe, were responsible for misleading them into investing in developments that failed to deliver promised returns. \"journalists fear they may be made legally liable for misleading readers who followed their advice and bought properties abroad, suffering major losses,\" says <mark>richard compton</mark> miller, a property journalist himself. \"there's a lot of anger among investors .\" if such a case were brought, it would raise questions about the responsibility of journalists who use supposedly impartial editorial space to promote commercial developments. it may be understood among journalists that the editorials of glossy property supplements follow a less rigorous code of impartiality than conventional journalism - they are essentially vehicles for advertising - but to the consumer such a distinction may not be so clear. articles recommending holiday homes abroad are particularly contentious, says <mark>compton</mark> miller. \"journalists would go on trips to places like bulgaria and recommend it as a place to buy a holiday flat. now, places like bulgaria have fared very badly, and people are feeling angry with the journalists who promoted it .\" property journalists have already fallen victim to the crash as newspapers have cut budgets and downpaged - or axed - their property supplements, because of loss of advertising. but many lawyers are sceptical about how strong a case against journalists could be. \"the idea that any investor could sue a property journalist is barking mad,\" says simon mcaleese, a dublin lawyer. \"though it wouldn't surprise me: people have been getting desperate to find someone to blame .\" even if it would be hard to prove that property journalists had deliberately misled readers, it is easy to see why investors might feel cheated. property journalism has exploded over the past decade in line with the boom. but it has always been fraught with questions of independence, as developers use offers of lavish trips abroad to entice journalists to write about their projects. \"there are a huge number of freebies,\" says journalist graham norwood. \"one top agent offered me cash to write a nice piece about a property. but part of the problem with international property is that the only way we can see a development is if the trip is paid for. newspapers can't afford to send us, and we can't afford to send ourselves .\" because of this, it is rare to find developments getting a negative press. \"if we don't like a development or property, we don't run an article,\" says one editor. this approach has led to certain supplements earning reputations for only running good-news stories, which investors might argue is misleading. but, says norwood: \"developers can be aggressive about coverage. they have threatened to sue newspapers if they publish negative editorial .\" among the victims of ireland's property crash are newspaper groups themselves: at the height of the boom in 2006, the irish times bought property search website myhome.ie for? 50m, a sum it would now be unlikely to fetch. and with papers investing in the property market, the impartiality of property supplements became even more questionable. \"there were certainly some journalists who were notorious for only writing good-news stories, and of questionable partiality,\" says one writer, who wishes to remain anonymous. \"but most are like any journalists, they try to be fair and accurate .\" whatever a story's angle, the burden of due diligence would always rest on an investor, says mcaleese. \"proving professional negligence is difficult at the best of times,\" he says. \"but the argument here would be impossible to stand up. it is buyer's remorse gone mad. it's like the mad murderer's argument: you knew i was mad, you should have put me in a padded cell .\" the false estate: did property journalists mislead investors? \"did property journalists mislead investors?\" bulgarian pm gets much praise from wb

steenhuysen chicago (reuters) - julia wood, a 51-year-old mother of 12 from chicago's east side, has some health insurance through a state program--but is so worried she may lose it she asks not to give her real name. wood's husband, a plumbing contractor, watched his business dry up in 2008 with the mortgage crisis. \"the economy hit us,\" said wood in an interview at the not-for-profit chicago family health center. like millions of americans, she is waiting for healthcare reform legislation signed into law by president barack obama in march to take effect. but like millions of americans, she is not sure what it will do for her. a thomson reuters poll of consumer confidence released on monday shows americans' confidence in their ability to pay for and access healthcare has fallen by 5 percent since december 2009. the thomson reuters consumer healthcare sentiment index, based on a monthly survey of 3,000 consumers, asks if they have had trouble paying for or had to postpone care in the three months prior. and it asks if they expect to in the coming three months. on every survey question, responses were more pessimistic in july than they were in december. \"that's a cause for concern to healthcare providers and policymakers,\" gary pickens, chief research officer at thomson reuters, parent company of reuters, said in a statement. pickens has seen a gradual eroding of confidence since december, despite a few notable peaks, such as in april, the month after congress passed the affordable care act. \"i doubt the average person really knows what has been implemented,\" he said. \"they just know there is a lot of talk and there has been a lot of negative publicity .\" letdown david kendall, a senior fellow for health and fiscal policy at thirdway, a centrist think tank, said dissatisfaction with the current health system likely reflects a letdown after the reform debate subsided. \"the healthcare debate raised people's expectations and there is now disappointment as a result that the problem isn't solved,\" kendall said. he said growing dissatisfaction with healthcare may help democrats who supported health reform a little. but it may also be polarizing. in the thomson reuters poll, republicans tend to have slightly higher confidence about access to healthcare, which may be linked to employment, pickens said. \"clearly, at the top of the pile, the most important factor is having insurance coverage,\" pickens said in a telephone interview. \"it's related to your employment status and, obviously, so many people in the country are out of work .\" republican national committee chairman <mark>michael steele</mark> said in a statement on friday that the white house has failed to win widespread support for health reform. \"for months, the white house promised wavering democrats that the bill would become more popular once it became law. the white house was wrong,\" he said. kendall, however, thinks concerns about the economy will overshadow any concerns about health reform in the midterm elections. \"what matters more to people right now is their concern about the deficit and the economy and their own jobs,\" he said. stephanie washington, a 50-year-old clerk for the chicago public schools, said she hopes healthcare does become an election issue.", "articleID": "2010082414_00222579_W", "names": {"Michael
