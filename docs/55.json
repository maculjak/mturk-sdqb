responded to brodeur's quick poke-check attempt with a nifty deke of his own in the second round of the shootout, pominville sealed it with a goal in the next round, and the sabres snapped a four-game winless streak with a 2-1 victory over the slumping new jersey devils on wednesday night. <mark>miller</mark> preserved the bonus point by stopping zach parise and jamie langenbrunner in the first two rounds to snap a personal three-game shootout losing streak. \"i wasn't going into the game banging my head against the wall, but i knew i could be better in the shootout,\" <mark>miller</mark> said. brodeur finished with 30 saves, while <mark>miller</mark> made 39 stops in a game that featured a potential olympic matchup. <mark>miller</mark> will likely be the starter for the united states, while

brodeur said about the shootout showdown. \"i thought he wasn't really looking at me .\" <mark>hecht</mark>, who's perfect on all three shootout attempts this season, certainly was. \"i saw him early

stayed away from the situations that we got ourselves into the last couple of games .\" brian rolston scored the only goal for the offensively-challenged devils (34-16-2), who've scored just 12 times during an eight-game stretch in which they've won just twice (2-5-1). \"we did a good job of creating opportunities, but we didn't finish,\" said langenbrunner, who was whistled for goalie interference 8 minutes into the third period after delivering a blow to <mark>miller</mark>'s head, then struck <mark>miller</mark> in the mask with a slap shot in overtime. \"(<mark>miller</mark>) bailed them out of a few situations .\" sabres center tim connolly failed to register a point, snapping his career-high 16-game points streak. brodeur, meanwhile, rebounded from a poor start against ottawa on tuesday in which he was pulled after allowing three goals on 12 shots over the first two periods. new jersey was playing its fourth game in six nights, while the sabres returned tuesday from their season-long seven-game swing out west. \"to me, it looked like you were looking at two tired teams,\" ruff said. \"there was only pockets of energy here and there .\" mair gave buffalo the early lead with his second of the year with 5:46 to go in the first period. standing in front of the net, mair was able to get a piece of derek roy's slap shot from the top of the right circle. rolston tied it with his 16th with 5:09 remaining in the second period. after a long pass from johnny oduya at the red line, rolston raced along the left wing before unleashing a slap shot from the left circle that beat <mark>miller</mark> on the short side. \"when you get more chances, you want to win,\" devils coach <mark>jacques lemaire</mark> said. \"you get a point, but this is a game that i felt we

common destination by jyoti kalsi, special to weekend review \"the path' by abdulnasser gharem. this installation was the artist's subtle but powerful way of questioning the assumptions people often make 3 abdulnasser gharem and al braithwaite come from different backgrounds. gharem was born in khamis mushait, a small town in saudi arabia, and continues to live and work there. his art is rooted in his environment and the people around him. al braithwaite is based in london but has travelled extensively around the middle east. his art aims to bridge cultural divides. but in their own unique ways, each artist challenges accepted norms, ideas and systems in our society and encourages people to re-examine their beliefs and choices. gharem is quite unique, not just as a conceptual artist in saudi arabia but also because he juggles his artistic work with his career as a major in the saudi arabian army. after joining the army he got the opportunity to study at the al miftaha arts village, where he discovered his talent for painting. an invitation to participate in the sharjah biennale exposed him to contemporary art, motivating him to become a conceptual artist. one of his first major successes was a project titled the path, centred around a bridge near his home. during a storm in the area, many people sought refuge on this bridge, believing that the concrete structure would keep them safe. but the bridge collapsed, resulting in the loss of many lives. a year later, gharem got together friends and relatives of those who died and spent three days spraying the words\" al siraat \"(the spiritual path) all over the broken bridge that leads nowhere. besides being an emotional tribute to the dead, this was gharem's subtle but powerful way of questioning the things people trust implicitly and the path they choose. fragility of concrete a video and photographs of that performance are part of gharem's latest exhibition titled restored behaviour. in this show, he explores and questions our trust in certain materials, structures and ideas through a series of installations and paintings created from rubber stamps. here, concrete is used as a symbol of things that we believe to be safe, immovable and absolute and the rubber stamps are a clever reference to bureaucracy and the authority of its accoutrements. and the ever-present grey and yellow markings similar to those on the roads in saudi arabia denote the path we are on. gharem's installations of lightboxes with detour signs, concrete roadblocks and diversions marked in grey and yellow playfully comment on the way we navigate our lives, blindly following rules and regulations laid down by those in authority, with the assumption that they are leading us on the right path. his paintings are witty and thought-provoking. for instance, in a painting titled obama, he uses the advertising slogan for a well-known american brand of children's shampoo to ask whether obama's election will really result in\" no more tears \"for the arab world. and in another painting titled no, no, no, yes, he uses words from palestinian poet mahmoud darwish's poem as a subtle allusion to the things we can and cannot do. as a soldier, gharem is often the one setting up roadblocks and enforcing rules and regulations; but as an artist, he exhorts people to question these routes and rules rather than accept them without thinking .\" life is a kind of stamped contract since the time you are born. you have religion, it's a contract. you have a wife, it's a contract; and between countries there is a contract for trading. but i want people to think about every contract and choice they make in life and to not be misdirected into having a false sense of security regarding certain materials and ideas. ultimately i want to question whether we as individuals, as cultures, as societies are following the right path or whether we should trust in a path at all, \"gharem says. while gharem's message is subtle, braithwaite's work is direct and in-your-face. the young artist is fascinated with the middle east. in 2002, he joined off screen, a group of european artists who travelled in the region holding art workshops and joint exhibitions with local artists. he thus has a good understanding of the middle eastern ethos and thinking. he uses it to confront western stereotypes and biased views and tries to present a balanced perspective on contemporary issues through his art. his latest work, titled hall of mirrors, is a playful and profound statement on the realignment of power in the 21st century. it includes a series of portraits of political leaders and other iconic figures from the middle east. the artist has used the 18th-century eglomise technique to etch the portraits behind mirrors. rather than firm lines, his portraits are composed of childish scrawls made with crayons, marker pens and pencils. but the scratchy mirror paintings are framed in antique gilt frames from the height of europe's imperial past. the rich, ornate frames, sourced from auctions and antique dealers, remind you of paintings of royalty seen in european palaces and manors. but the grand oil paintings of those emperors and generals of the past have been swapped with braithwaite's na\u00efve, airy portraits of personalities such as muammar gaddafi, ayatollah khomeini, reza shah pahlavi, caliph ali ibn abu talib, haifa wehbe, osama bin laden and <mark>saddam hussain</mark>. the artist describes this quirky juxtaposition of the orient and occident, old and new, and ornate and sketchy as\" reverse colonisation \". allusion to regime change\" the world is changing rapidly and people are torn by a conflicting sense of identity and responsibility on issues ranging from climate change to the war on terror. this series comments on the changing reality and our struggle to reconcile the past with present geopolitical situations. showing these antique european frames occupied by middle eastern power barons is an experiment in regime change. europe has a history of colonisation and by recolonising history, i am trying to restore the balance and relieve postcolonial stress by shearing off some of the west's tentacles and puncturing european vanity, \"braithwaite says .\" i used mirrors because i wanted the message to be direct and in-your-face. quite literally, this work holds up a mirror to society to see how it looks and feels when daoud successfully slingshots a piece of rubble into the eye of goliath. \"email a friend emailing an article to friend is a simple way to share a news item.

planned. first, the aggressive combo guard was sidelined with a leg injury for 5 weeks, watching his westbury teammates eat defeat in the most challenging non-league games of their schedule. once he returned and worked his way back into action, personal reasons not only yanked him out of the line up, but had him mia from games altogether. \"i got in trouble with my mom for doing something wrong\" , the 6' 2 junior reflected. \"she took me off the team for a bit, but she (eventually) changed her mind and let me play basketball again .\" with westbury on a losing skid that pushed them out of the top 10last week (with their second loss to elmont this season), hagigal returned to action just in time with a 28 point, 11 rebound performance to help catapult westbury to a sorely needed win over their league rival south side cyclones, 65-64, in ot. hagigal wasn't bashful about making up for lost time, keeping westbury afloat with a buffet of mid-range jumpers, treys and coast to coast reverse lay-ups to start the game. south side would reciprocate, thanks to a cyclone of a start from 6' 5 big man brett cohen, who did much of the same. with westbury top gun paris abrams and south side's answer, <mark>leon taylor</mark>, both cold to start, hagigal and cohen would get a bit of help from the role players. 6' 3 forward ryan spadaford twisted his way to the hoop to give the cyclones a 12-7 lead, but lucens victor would help hagigal tie it up to end the first period. both teams would stay on each other's heels for much of the second quarter, making mini-runs and keeping each other honest. cohen's fast break lay-up gave the cyclones a four point lead, 23-19, but hagigal calmly waltzed up to the arc and buried a triple to close the gap. with the pace picking up and <mark>taylor</mark> beginning to percolate, westbury answered with a dose of diamond pressure. eventually, they would recapture the lead when mikey hooks nailed a three at the halftime buzzer to put westbury up, 29-27. westbury would open up the second half in a blaze, pressing, trapping and eventually going up six, 33-27. but south side adhered to the game script by making a counter-run, and a coast to coast lay-in from cohen brought them back within a deuce, 37-35. thanks to a solid display of defensive hustle and some play making prowess from lamard herron - pg tyrece redd didn't arrive until the third quarter - hagigal was able to convert on the break and in the paint. but the cyclones stuck around, and when redd turned the ball over with the quarter winding down, cohen converted on the other end to tie it at 43, sending the cyclones' home crowd into a frenzy. from that point onward, it was anyone's game. abrams sent home a trey to give westbury a 51-45 lead, but once again, here come the cyclones. <mark>david white</mark> answered with a long ball of his own, and moments later (after eating up 32 seconds of shot clock), julius jones dittoed with one from the corner to tie it at 51 with 4:12 left in regulation. both teams would take turns answering each other, but south side's 2-3 zone began to put the clamps on westbury's half court set down the stretch. with westbury seemingly limited to fast break points, the cyclones looked to have the momentum despite the game being a one possession affair throughout the waning moments. with the game tied at 57 and under a minute left, jones muscled in a put back to give the cyclones the edge and left westbury with only one shot to seal the deal. abrams' desperation shot rimmed out, but the 5' 9 redd slipped into the paint for the put back with time running out, saving the game and sending the nassau a rivals packing for a trip to overtime. the back and forth plot continued at the start of the extra session, but the turnover bug suddenly bit both teams. with 46.9 seconds on the clock, the score was tied at 63, and westbury's allegiance to defense stunted south side in their half court set, to the point of nailing the cyclones with a 35 second violation. with 12.3 on the clock, westbury finally broke the silence when herron's short inbound pass to hagigal was powered in from deep in the post for a point blank lay-up to give them a 65-63 lead. herron was forced to foul <mark>taylor</mark> with 0.7 left in the game and westbury in the bonus, making it seem as if double overtime was on the radar. <mark>taylor</mark>'s first attempt drew silence from the gym, as it bounced around the cylinder for a good two seconds and eventually dropped, sending the home crowd into pandemonium. the second attempt, however, didn't share the same fortune, and westbury escaped a two game in-league slide at the hands of the persistent cyclones. \"i'm just glad to be back and i'm happy we were able to pull
