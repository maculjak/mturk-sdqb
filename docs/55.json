While death penalty is considered by its proponents a deterrent from crime, opponents point to flaws in the justice system - especially since the rise of the more sophisticated DNA tests that led to some exonerations. A report released on April 18, 2012, by the prestigious National Research Council of the National Academies, based on a review of more than three decades of research, concluded that studies claiming a deterrent effect on murder rates from the death penalty are fundamentally flawed. Said the report: \"The committee concludes that research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates...Consequently, claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgements about capital punishment.\" Not much help here in helping one make one's mind up. Whatever the case, some ugly crimes have been committed in Jordan recently, so the government is probably acting under pressure from the public now. While people want to see the phenomenon stemmed, officials need to tread a thin line between allaying citizens' fears, or anger, and upholding the country's stand and recognition worldwide as wanting to be among the increasing number of nations that abolish death penalty. Such move would be in deference to the Kingdom's obligations under existing international norms. It could also be taken in view of the fact that death penalty does not seem to actually contribute to lowering crime rates. Instead of executing people, the country has to deal with the causes of crime and try to address them. Poverty, ignorance and a justice system that by the minister's admission has loopholes can be often blamed for crimes, of all kinds. Education, awareness, reinforcing the value system of yore, good neighbourliness and good living conditions often keep crime at bay. His Majesty <mark>King Abdullah</mark> told an Italian newspaper in 2005 that, \"in coordination with the European Union, we would like to modify our Penal Code. Jordan could soon become the first country in the Middle East without capital punishment.\" This is a serious commitment that the government should take into consideration upon reviewing legislation, death penalty foremost.

The\" new deal \"is an attempt by the Prime Minister to win over critics across the Commons who have rejected her three previous attempts to get an agreement through.

The talks also covered the\" whole range of topics \"related to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including customs arrangements and calls for a second referendum.

But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who has said she could stand in the contest to replace Mrs <mark>May</mark>, insisted the UK had to be prepared to walk away without a Brexit deal. (PA Graphics) Despite the collapse of cross-party talks with Labour, the WAB contains a series of commitments on workers' rights and environmental protections designed to appeal to opposition MPs. It also contains commitments to look at alternative arrangements to prevent the need for the controversial backstop aimed at keeping a soft border with Ireland, an olive branch for Tory Brexiteers and the DUP. Mrs Leadsom, one of the Cabinet's leading Brexiteers, said she would support the Bill, but warned that could change if its provisions were watered down.\" I continue to support the Prime Minister to get her Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, \"she told BBC Radio 4's Today.\" It is leaving the European Union and so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union, I continue to support it. \"What I do think is that for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away.\" Justice Secretary David Gauke (Isabel Infantes/PA) But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry dismissed the idea of Labour supporting it, claiming the Bill was a \"piece of political theatre\" for Mrs <mark>May</mark> to have one last shot at getting her deal through. \"It's almost like she is setting up her own political version of the last rites,\" she told Today. \"She cannot realistically expect to see this get through without fundamental changes and we are not going to see fundamental changes, from everything I hear.\" Defeat for the WAB will accelerate Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s departure from Downing Street, with the Prime Minister due to set out the timetable for the contest to replace her after the vote.

The new coach said that the interaction with the team has been good, and he will adjust to working in the setup. \"The interaction with the team has been good. I have been in this profession for a long time, I have interacted with almost all the players. Nothing too tough, it will take me some time to adjust in the setup of team India but I will manage.

Everyone has played a good number of matches. The entire team is backing them and I am sure we continue to back them up, they will produce good results, \"Rathore said.\" We are fortunate to have so many all-rounders in the T20 format. Manish and Shreyas are two fine cricketers. Manish has done well in the past and Shreyas had a successful tour to West Indies. They just need to be consistent, \"he added. Rishabh Pant who has been often criticised for playing reckless shots, got the backing of the new batting coach but Rathore said that the players in the side need to understand the difference between fearless cricket and careless cricket.\" All young cricketers need to understand the difference between fearless cricket and careless cricket. The team wants everyone to play without fear. We want Rishabh to play all his shots as it makes him special. But you do not want any batsman to be careless and reckless, \"Rathore said.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla ., reforming the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. On Wednesday, Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) unveiled a Web video, calling on <mark>Nelson</mark> to back Rubio's \"VA Accountability First Act.\" <mark>Nelson</mark> has supported similar legislation in the past. \"How many more veterans will die waiting for care at the Department of Veterans Affairs?\" the narrator of the ad asks. \"How many more will be neglected by the people hired to serve them? How many more will suffer before the Senate acts?\" CVA Executive Director Mark Lucas weighed in on why his group was running the new ad. \"Senator <mark>Nelson</mark> has supported strong VA accountability measures in the past, and there should be nothing stopping him from doing so now,\" Lucas said. \"The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 will help Secretary Shulkin get rid of the bad VA employees who drive a toxic culture and fail to give our veterans the care they need. Veterans shouldn't have to suffer at the hands of incompetent or negligent VA employees. We urge the Senate to prioritize sending the VA Accountability First Act of 2017 to President Trump's desk.\" CVA is running similar ads across the nation, urging swing state Democrats who are expected to face competitive races next year, including <mark>Nelson</mark>, to support the legislation. Other swing state Democrats targeted include U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana. Rubio teamed up with U.S. Rep. <mark>Phil Roe</mark>, R-Tenn ., the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, to bring out the <mark>bill</mark> at the start of March. This is not a new subject for Rubio who had been pushing for reforming the VA, often teaming with then U.S. Rep. <mark>Jeff Miller</mark>, R-Fla ., who chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee, on the issue. With both Rubio and <mark>Miller</mark> leading the charge, Congress passed a reform measure in 2014 after reports emerged about veterans dying after being placed on altered waiting lists while seeking medical treatment from VA facilities, including those in the Phoenix, Arizona area. In the aftermath of these reports, few VA employees lost their jobs after the scandal broke though then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned his post under fire. According to his office, Rubio's new proposal \"would provide improved protections for whistleblowers; empower the VA secretary to reduce an employee's federal pension if they are convicted of a felony that influenced their job at VA; allow the VA secretary to recoup a bonus provided to an employee who engaged in misconduct or poor performance prior to receiving the bonus, or recoup any relocation expenses that were authorized for a VA employee only through the employee's ill-gotten means, such as fraud, waste or malfeasance.\" \"For far too long, incompetent and uncaring employees at the VA have been allowed to fail at their jobs but still keep them,\" Rubio said when he brought out the proposal last month. \"In the past, we've passed measures to institute accountability but lacked a president and VA secretary who would actually implement them and fire VA employees who are failing our veterans. Now it's time to finally provide our veterans with the quality, efficient health care they have earned and deserve, instead of protecting the big labor unions seeking to keep the status quo of incompetence and malfeasance.\" The VA Accountability First Act will give the VA secretary increased flexibility to remove, demote, or suspend VA employees who fail to take care of our veterans, \"Rubio added.\" I am pleased President Trump has made this issue a priority, and I look forward to working with Secretary Shulkin to hold VA employees at all levels accountable for their performance and ensure our veterans are no longer ignored or mistreated. \""}, {"articleID": "2014110521_00057827_W", "names": {"Kevin Francis": ["Q1740144", "Q26706887", "Q6396315", "Q6396316"]}, "date": "2014-11-05", "url": "http://theherald.com.au/story/2677524/hunt-for-two-men-raiding-hunter-drug-dealers/?cs=2452", "content": "h1 itemprop = \"name\" > Hunt for two men raiding Hunter drug dealers HUNTER: Two men are allegedly breaking into drug dealers' homes armed with knives and swords.

(Shutterstock) India has become the world's worst victim of extreme weather events driven by climate change, with a sharp increase in climate-linked deaths and economic damage in recent years, analysts said in a report released on Wednesday. The Global Climate Risk Index 2020, released by the non-profit Germanwatch on the sidelines of the UN climate change meeting in Madrid, says India witnessed 2,081 deaths--the highest in the world--caused by extreme weather events in 2018, followed by Japan with 1,282. In 2017, India was in second position. The report places India at fifth position in overall\" climate vulnerability \"in 2018, behind Japan, the Philippines, Germany and Madagascar. Analysts said this marked a significant fall from India's 14th position in an analysis for 2017. According to the report, India's economic losses from extreme weather events touched $37,808 million (Rs 2.7 lakh crore) in 2018, almost a threefold rise since 2017. India has been ranked third on climate-linked fatalities and economic losses over the two-decade period spanning 1999 to 2018.\" A series of extreme weather events impacted India in 2018, \"Vera Kunjel, the report's lead author, told The Telegraph. The extreme weather events included the heavy rainfall and floods in Kerala, the tropical cyclones Gaja and Titli, and a prolonged heat wave.\" All of these have collectively propelled India into the position of being the country worst hit by extreme weather, \"Kunjel said. The report said the Kerala disaster was\" the worst in a hundred years \"and that India was\" affected by extreme heat in both 2018 and 2019 \". The reportsaid that since 2004, India had experienced 11 of its 15 warmest years on record. Maik Winges, another of the report's authors, said that although the developing countries continued to bear the brunt of climate change, two developed countries--Japan and Germany--had for the first time occupied positions among the three worst-hit nations.\" This is a clear signal that the impacts of climate change are (being witnessed) everywhere, \"Winges said. <mark>Harjeet Singh</mark>, global climate lead of ActionAid, said the long-term climate effects documented in the report underlined the importance of implementing a\" loss and damage \"process under the global climate pact. UN climate negotiations have included discussions on loss and damage, which propose that the developed countries should provide support, including finance, to the developing and underdeveloped countries affected by climate change. The argument is that the less developed nations bear less responsibility for the greenhouse gas emissions that have triggered climate change. Although a mechanism was set up during the Warsaw climate summit in 2013 to work on loss-and-damage-related issues, sustained opposition from the developed countries, especially their resistance to providing funds, has put it on the backburner.\" It is expected that loss and damage will be a key issue during the negotiations in Madrid, \"Aarti Khosla of Climate Trend said.
