kelsey barlow continues to make an impact. in purdue's 69-58 victory over wake forest on tuesday in the big ten/acc challenge, the freshman from cathedral high school helped turn the tide. he clamped down on speedy wake forest point guard ishmael smith and got to the free throw line twice, making four free throws, in purdue's first nine second-half possessions. smith, whose penetration sparked the deacons' two-point halftime lead, didn't score in the second half until purdue held a double-digit lead. \"kelsey did a great job of coming in and changing the game with rebounding and penetration,\" purdue junior forward robbie hummel said. \"he's athletic enough to get up and over some of the wake forest big men and he did that .\" barlow finished with six points, three rebounds and two assists. barlow's free throws with 14:47 to go put purdue up for good, 37-36. after barlow entered the game in the second half, wake forest didn't score on five consecutive possessions as smith couldn't get into the lane. \"it was obvious we needed to stop him,\" barlow said. \"stop him and (al-farouq aminu), just contain the middle drives. i think we did a pretty good job .\" barlow left the game with 1:52 to play after a behind-the-back pass to jajuan johnson that was successful but not appreciated in that situation by purdue coach \"he told me,\" after college, go play for the harlem globetrotters, but don't do something like that,' \"barlow said. in the second half, purdue outscored wake forest 20-10 in the paint and 17-4 off turnovers. the boilers won at the line (24-for-31) and on the boards (40-38). wake forest was outrebounding opponents 44-34 .\" coach painter always tells us, if we can do well rebounding and shoot more free throws as a team, you give your team a good chance to win, \"said johnson, who had 21 points and nine rebounds. this was the first win in the big ten/acc challenge for purdue's junior class .\" we were really motivated to come out and get this win, \"hummel said...purdue's 6-3 <mark>chris kramer</mark> spent most of the game guarding 6-9 aminu, who had 12 points, seven below his average. you must fill out the comment body in order to submit

religious role of women thank you for submitting your comment or question to aarp bulletin today. your post is now on its way to the appropriate bulletin writer. due to the large volume of

intrusive to some local women while others say it is a chance to emphasize good works and call more women to religious life. the $1.1 million study--which some view as more of an investigation--includes hundreds of questions on the spiritual and personal lives of this country's 59,000 catholic sisters. u.s. bishops are being asked to fund the three-year undertaking. topics range from finances to attracting new members to nuns who dissent publicly from church teachings in such areas as civil disobedience and sexuality. \"we are closing schools and churches and they are asking the diocese to spend money on this type of thing?\" said sister lil mattingly, a maryknoll missioner who said she is speaking for herself and not as a maryknoll. mattingly said she has a hard time reconciling the wealth in rome with funding problems here. \"we try very hard to review our own lives and how jesus is calling us to live, but i'd like to call on rome to work on that,\" she said. the women being studied are those who work in \"apostolic activities,\" as opposed to cloistered nuns who live in relative seclusion and lead lives of prayer and contemplation. tucson bishop gerald f. kicanas said there are far more apostolic nuns than cloistered nuns in the u.s. today, which might be the reason for the vatican's focus. he said the study is being done to \"strengthen religious life, and to explore ways our religious communities in the united states can...increase in numbers .\" sister elizabeth ohmann, a franciscan nun who works for humane borders, believes there's a different reason the focus is on apostolic nuns. \"i think--and this is my opinion--that they are saying they believe it's the active communities that are really encouraging, say, women priests and are also upholding the rights of homosexuals and even homosexual marriage,\" she said. ohmann said some of her personal beliefs, and those of some of her fellow sisters, are not in keeping with what the church proclaims. \"are we going contrary to rome's teachings? i say,\" yes, it is contrary to rome's teachings .' but it is not contrary to my own conscience, \"she said. kicanas said the bishops are being invited to pay for the study, but it is not required. he doesn't know if they will help with the cost. the diocese of tucson filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004. the nun study was announced last january and written portions were due last week. next, there will be on-site visitations to some congregations. a vatican-approved web site on the study (www.apostolic visitation.org) includes information from cardinal <mark>franc rode</mark> on the reasons for the study .\" like other vocations in the church, religious life has passed through challenging times, \"<mark>rode</mark> wrote .\" apostolic works have also changed significantly because of societal changes. these and other areas need to be better understood and assessed in order to safeguard and promote consecrated life in the united states. \"kicanas said people often react to inquiries like this with fear .\" there's always a level of trepidation that comes with a review and yet it has always been extremely beneficial, \"he said .\" i think our religious communities will have an opportunity, through this study, to identify the significant contributions they have made to the mission of the church. \"laurie olson, a local member of call to action, a national catholic reform movement, said other vatican studies have been conducted following a crisis or scandal, which is not the case this time .\" one can only conclude it's an attack on the sisters, that they are trying to rein them in in some fashion, \"she said .\" it seems to be the pattern of the hierarchy, to attack and further diminish the role of women in the church. \"sister rina cappellazzo, the tucson diocese's vicar for religious, said the study is a chance to look at all the contributions nuns are making, and how things can be done better in the future .\" it's another review of who we are, what we do and why we do it, \"she said .\" after any kind of study, there is a new direction, a clarified vision and sometimes you take a new direction. \"she hopes the study will help attract more women to religious life. there are 194 sisters in the diocese of tucson .\" one of the things that we're hoping is that women will look at this and say, \"this is what i want to join. i want to be a part of this,'\" she said.", "articleID": "2009120411_00294255_W", "names": {"Franc Rode": ["Q468883", "Q5478312"]}},

appreciable accumulations due to the warmth of the ground and other conditions. state offices closed early in 13 louisiana parishes friday afternoon as more southern parts of the state prepared for an evening blast of wintry weather that was expected to include snow - rare anytime in louisiana but especially unusual in early december. <mark>mike griffin</mark>, a forecaster for the national weather

party case (file photo by ryan j. reilly / main justice). the u.s. commission on civil rights has subpoenaed the justice department to obtain documents related to the handling of the case against the new black panther party and several members. documents the commission is seeking include witness statements, copies of investigations by the justice department, reports of suspected voter intimidation, documents on the decision to drop charges and communications among doj officials relating to the case. just one problem - it's up to the justice department to enforce the subpoena from the executive branch agency. and therein lies the conflict. the justice department has declined to hand over the material. it says its employees are not subject to contempt of court for refusing to disclose internal doj documents, under a 1951 u.s. supreme court decision, united states ex rel. touhy v. ragen. in addition, the department is conducting internal reviews related to the incident and has not set a time frame for when it expects to complete them. todd gaziano, the commissioner leading the inquiry into the case, told main justice that doj is stonewalling and that he doesn't buy their explanation for not facilitating the commission's investigation. \"it's a tremendous waste of resources for the attorney general to act in a lawless way,\" gaziano said. \"the department has no statute that exempts them from our subpoena authority .\" the commission's lack of independent authority to enforce the subpoenas it issues doesn't diminish its status, said gaziano. he says the commission had to resort to subpoenas because the department inadequately respond to several letters requesting information. until a final decision related to the commission's review of the matter has been made, the department has instructed the two career civil rights section lawyers subpoenaed so far to \"abide by lawful departmental regulations .\" that means they can't be deposed without the approval of the justice department. \"given the scope of the request, the civil division informed the commission that it would not be able to review its request in the time frame requested,\" said doj spokesperson alejandro miyar. \"we've requested additional information from the commission and we'll respond, but no, there is no time frame .\" rep. lamar smith (photo by ryan j. reilly / main justice). an inquiry into the matter was opened by the office of professional responsibility at the request of house judiciary committee chairman lamar smith (r-texas), according to a doj letter to smith dated aug. 28. members of the black separatist group stood outside a philadelphia polling place last november in military-style fatigues. the government filed a civil lawsuit against the organization and three members in the waning days of the bush administration. j. christian adams, a career voting section attorney with a record of conservative advocacy, who was hired in 2005 by then-civil rights division political appointee brad schlozman. a joint investigation of schlozman by the doj's inspector general and opr found that schlozman had broken federal law by improperly taking politicla and ideological affiliations into account when hiring career civil service lawyers. the report said schlozman was \"unsuitable for public service\" and found he'd referred to applicants with liberal affiliations as \"mold spores,\" \"commies\" and \"crazy pinkos .\" earlier this year, then-acting civil rights division chief loretta king recommended dismissing most of the complaint, after the new black panther members and the party failed to respond. associate attorney general tom perrelli approved her recommendation, the washington times has reported. most of the complaint was dismissed in may. an injunction was obtained against one new black panther party member who held a nightstick outside the philadelphia polling place. read the notice of dismissal conservatives have characterized the incident as evidence of politicization of the justice department under attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark>. the complaint alleged violations of the voting rights act section 11 (b), which deals with voter intimidation. it was only the third case on alleged violations of section 11 (b) in the history of the voting rights act, passed in 1965. doj officials say they are following department policy regarding disclosure of information about cases and requiring their current and former employees to do the same. \"we've had long standing guidelines that are very clear that current and former employees must be authorized by the department before disclosing internal information regarding their official duties,\" said miyar. \"we have to follow the long standing guidelines .\" in a letter to the justice department, the commission's general counsel refered to a \"dearth of cooperation\" on the part of the department. \"we are mindful of the sensitivity of the subject matter involved and aware that, in response to similar requests, the department has raised various concerns and matters of privilege,\" wrote david blackwood. \"while such considerations carry weight, cooperation with commission investigations is a mandatory statutory obligation .\" democratic commissioners have criticized the agency's narrow focus on the black panther incident. but at least one prominent republican also agrees. \"they're provoking a confrontation with the white house, and i'm not sure what the benefits are going to be,\" conservative commentator linda chavez, a former staff director for the commission, told main justice. \"obama has left them alone for now, but he could come in and make big changes,\" said chavez. calling the commission an \"odd hybrid,\" that has been \"a thorn in the side of many different administrations,\" chavez said she considers the commission an executive branch agency with very little authority. she said the information it is requesting from the justice department, specifically the internal communications between officials handling the case, should fall under executive privilege. \"it calls up the whole question of whether the commission has outlived it's usefulness,\" said chavez. gaziano disagreed with chavez. the commission's subpoena power is akin to that of a congressional committee, said gaziano.", "articleID": "2009121017_00008487_W", "names": {"Eric Holder": ["Q312644", "Q3591180"]}}, {"date": "2009-12-12", "url":

gun dealers and a stolen mac-10 pistol when he was killed by a plainclothes officer near the marriott marquis hotel. the handgun, which held 30 rounds, jammed after <mark>martinez</mark> got off three shots. jordan kelsey-stewart, 25, bought the weapon from dale's guns in powhatan, va., chief nypd police spokesman <mark>paul browne</mark> said. officials with bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms

dale's guns, said he provided the information about who bought the gun to the atf earlier friday. he said kelsey-stewart was from the richmond area, had all the proper identification and passed a background check when she purchased the weapon. blankenship said she bought the gun by herself. he didn't know what happened to the gun after he sold it. \"i have no idea,\" he told the associated press. \"i really don't know what happened. i don't know how the gun was stolen .\" <mark>martinez</mark>, 25, went by the rap name \"ready\" and regularly sold cds for his group, square free, in times square. he was part of a freelance collection of hawkers who sell self-produced wares on the street. police said <mark>martinez</mark> ran a scam in which he would autograph a cd or put a passerby's name on it, and then demand payment of $10. he had been arrested june 19 at 1515 broadway, the exact same location where thursday's confrontation started, for not having a tax stamp, which allows hawkers to sell their self-produced wares. vendors selling their own work are protected by the first amendment and fall outside the stricter regulation of vendors selling retail goods. the sheer number of vendors in times square and their aggressiveness lead to frequent confrontations with authorities trying to catch counterfeiters and protect tourists from scams. <mark>martinez</mark> and his brother are well known to regular times square denizens and videos of them rapping and getting hassled by police are posted on youtube. in one shaky video, <mark>martinez</mark> shouts, \"they ain't taking me nowhere!\" and \"i'm ready to lay some down!\" as officers, their hands in their pockets, escort him from the area. his lyrics talk of hawking cds and staring down cops. sgt. christopher newsom usually works in uniform on a task force that tracks aggressive peddling. he was in plainclothes when he stopped <mark>martinez</mark> on thursday and asked him for his tax stamp, setting off the chase and shootout. josiah deandrea, who was distributing fliers friday to a comedy act a block from the shooting scene, said he had seen <mark>martinez</mark> in the area in the past. \"nobody had any idea he had a gun,\" deandrea said. daniel o'phalen, 24, who passes out fliers in times square for the musical \"white christmas,\" said <mark>martinez</mark> was part of a regular crew of cd salesmen. sometimes, he said, the group would order him off a corner, saying he was on their territory. \"they're pushy. they're not nice guys,\" he said. still, it's rare that police encounters with peddlers escalate to gunfire. \"these are usually quality-of-life violations, and they typically do not escalate, they don't involve violators being armed,\" <mark>browne</mark> said. if <mark>martinez</mark> had recently gone looking for a gun, it wouldn't have been unusual for him to look out of state. because buying a firearm is so difficult in new york, people barred from owning pistols here often travel south to shop at gun shows where there are no required background checks for people buying secondhand weapons. <mark>martinez</mark> didn't have a license to own a firearm. there is also a steady supply of guns purchased at southern gun shops and smuggled north. mayor michael bloomberg has been a fierce critic of gun stores with a record of selling weapons that later wound up in the hands of criminals, suing several of them in recent years for reckless conduct and driving several out of business. there are \"too many guns on the streets,\" the mayor said
