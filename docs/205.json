Eurozone industrial output slumps Putin defends conservative values Thousands queue to bid sad farewell as Mandela lies in state Mourners pay respects to Mandela Barcelona that the referendum would ask the region's voters if they want Catalonia to be a state and, if so, should it be independent. Mr Mas did not clarify the distinction between a state and an independent state. However, the questions appeared to open a door for those nationalists who want Catalonia to have the structure of a state but remain a part of Spain, possibly along the lines of Puerto Rico and the United States. Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz Gallardon responded to Mr Mas' announcement, saying a referendum would be illegal and would not be allowed. Spain's Constitution says only the central government in Mariano Rajoy recently rejected a request by Mr Mas to allow one. The government has not said what it might do to prevent a ballot. Mr Mas said the referendum date was set almost a year away so as to give ample time for negotiations with Madrid on \"the way to stage the consultation legally.\" Polls indicate that Catalans are roughly evenly split on independence. The European Union and Nato have warned Catalonia it would be excluded if it seceded. Scotland is staging an independence referendum next year, on September 18. That vote has been approved by the British government. Mr Mas began pushing for a referendum after he failed to clinch a better financial pact for Catalonia with the central government in 2012. The referendum proposal got the support of some one million people who turned out at two demonstrations held since then. The possibility of a region having the right to decide its future has stirred much political debate and raised questions as to whether it is time to reform the 1978 constitution to ease territorial discontent. The Basque region, which has traditionally sought greater powers, failed in a bid to hold a self-determination referendum several years ago. Catalonia is one of the country's most powerful regions and represents roughly a fifth of Spain's 1.1 trillion euro (? 930 bn) GDP. Its population of 7.5 million is greater than those of EU members such as Denmark, Ireland or Finland. The region, like others in Spain, has its own language as well as Spanish. Its financial powers include some tax collecting rights.

He would clean the boots of Juninho as a teenage scholar at Middlesbrough, dreaming of the time he might join the Brazilian on the first team stage. A little later than normal, because of Juninho's departure and then return to Teesside a few years later, Stockdale eventually did. Through hard work and determination, the young man from Redcar made it onto the first team stage--and that is the message he has been banging at Sunderland over the last five-and-a-half years. And, having first joined Sunderland as a coach in the youth set-up from Grimsby Town, he was as proud as anyone else at the club last weekend when five graduates of the academy system helped secure a vital 1-0 win over Hull City at first team level. Loading article content Joel Asoro scored the winner that afternoon and he had George Honeyman, Josh Maja and Ethan Robson alongside him. Lynden Gooch emerged from the bench too. Having experienced what it is like to make the grade the grade at Premier League level with Middlesbrough and then eventually move on seven years later, when he went onto have spells at numerous clubs in lower leagues, Stockdale has stressed the challenge is to stay there. He said:\" The distance from the Under-23s room to the first team room at the Academy is maybe 50 steps. That is the hardest 50 steps any player will ever make. They think they're closer but it is the hardest to take. You have to embrace it and once you do get there you have to stay there. \"I always remember <mark>Curtis Fleming</mark> at Middlebsrough saying to me, when we were battling for the right-back place and an Argentinian came in for the trial. <mark>Curtis</mark> said to me,\" come on, he's not taking our place'. That's the mentality you've got to have, people always want to take your place. \"Sunderland manager Chis Coleman is showing he is willing to give youth a chance, even if he is probably giving more than he would like because of the club's predicament. In that sense, Championship football and relegation from the Premier League has helped. Stockdale said:\" If they're good enough they would get the chance. Certainly this year we wanted them to be part of it and that drips down to the academy. So the Under-23s on Tuesday night was a young team, we're trying to mould that into an Under-19 team if we can so they get an experience of older football. \"We want to get the Under-16s in the Under-18s and if they're good enough the U23s. That's the idea, filter the better players if you like and test them quicker. We'll be sending players out on loans, too.\" Sunderland have wasted plenty of cash over the last decade on players who have not fitted into the club's way or not lived up to their billing; so the change of direction should be applauded and welcomed now that they are in the Championship's relegation zone. Coleman is also keen to build a reputation for helping Sunderland by developing youth from other clubs, highlighted by his capture of Chelsea youngster Jake Clarke-Salter and how he has put him in the team straightaway. Stockdale, who has remained a first team coach under Coleman, said: \"Sometimes it can lift them to have senior players alongside them, because you feel that extra responsibility to the players next to you.\" We had <mark>Colin Cooper</mark> in yesterday, he works with the England Under-21s now and so he came in to see Jake. Jake said to him, I've learned more about defending playing alongside John O\u2019Shea in two games than I have in any amount of junior football. The senior pros have all been in that situation and you really do remember those chats you have, those little bits of information. \"Stockdale certainly had that in his younger days. As a teenager in 1998 his debut was alongside Mark Schwarzer, Paul Merson and Co in Middlesbrough colours. He said:\" It was a cup game on the Tuesday night against QPR. Bryan Robson told me the day before I was in, which didn't help me sleep! But then, and this is the high and lows, on Saturday I was cleaning the boots. \"What is important, and it was exactly the same with me and Boro, is that the younger players come into an environment with really good senior pros. Nigel Pearson was my captain, Robbie Mustoe, <mark>Steve Vickers</mark>. They lead the way and you follow, it is still the same now.\" Now Stockdale is playing a huge part in providing the link between the academy at Sunderland and the first team picture, where the likes of Honeyman are grateful to the advice they have received. Honeyman has played more than any other player for Sunderland this season, and is determined to stay in the mix for the longer term. Sunderland might be in the throes of a relegation battle, but he is convinced that the experience can make all of the young talents stronger people and players. He said: \"I think it can make or break you. To get to this stage, though, I think you have to have a certain mental toughness anyway. There are so many young lads who come through who are all desperate to be first-team players, and you go through so many ups and downs even at a young age, that if you don't have that mental toughness then you will have probably fallen by the wayside anyway by now.\" It (the relegation fight) is not where we want to be, obviously, but once we come through it I am sure it will help the young lads in the long run. \"When you are a young player coming in, you have that excitement, and you probably don't realise the pressures. Ethan, Joel and Maj, they just want to come in and do really well--they are not focused on the consequences of defeat. That's the kind of freshness that young players can bring.\" Sunderland are up against Birmingham on Tuesday and Coleman hopes to have more new arrivals in by then. He signed winger Kazenga LuaLua on a free until the end of the season on Thursday night and is still in the hunt for at least one striker and a goalkeeper. Derby's <mark>Chris Martin</mark> is still on the radar, while it has emerged Hearts striker Kyle Lafferty is also under serious consideration. The Scottish Premier League club, however, are seeking a fee for the experienced Northern Ireland front-man. 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2019050311_00332192_W", "names": {"Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"]}, "date": "2019-05-03", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/games/72423/Tennis", "content": "TENNIS WORLD TOUR REVIEW.

AP/REX Shutterstock For someone who talks a big game about respecting the military, President Trump spends a lot of time offending service members. His latest affront came after John McCain died Saturday. That night, the president reportedly nixed the released of a statement honoring McCain's legacy, instead opting to fire off a perfunctory tweet that failed to commend the senator. The next morning, Trump occupied himself by attacking the Justice Department, and on Monday he ordered the American flags at the White House to return to full-staff, despite the tradition that they remain lowered until the deceased can be interned. While appearing before reporters later in the day, Trump refused to answer questions about McCain. Some of America's most prominent veterans groups were not happy. \"On the behalf of the American Legion's two million wartime veterans, I strongly urge you to make an appropriate presidential proclamation noting Senator McCain's death and legacy of service to our nation, and that our nation's flag be half-staffed through his interment,\" Denise Rohan, the national commander of the American Legion, wrote in a statement, adding that McCain \"was an American hero and cherished member of The American Legion\" before listing his credentials as a Vietnam veteran and member of Congress.

If showing appropriate reverence for service members in any way conflicts with his own ego, he'll throw any veteran under the bus without giving it a second thought. He did so with McCain after the senator was critical of him in 2015, arguing that the Vietnam veteran--who not only was shot down and jailed, but refused to be released because other American soldiers had been imprisoned longer--was not a war hero. That comment alone should have disqualified Trump from ever pretending to respect those who have served. Veterans, including Lindsey Graham, were outraged.

A few days later, while discussing how he was gifted a Purple Heart by a retired lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq, Trump joked about the honor.\" And I said, \"Man, that's like big stuff. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,\" Trump said. \"This was much easier.\" (Trump famously received five dubious draft deferments during the Vietnam War .) Once again, everyone was outraged. \"A direct attack on a Gold Star family, for their patriotism, for their integrity, is totally unprecedented,\" Paul Reickhoff, the founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told Rachel Maddow. \"This is beyond partisanship. This is about honor. This is about integrity. It's completely out of bounds.\" Reickhoff added a belief that the issue would affect Trump at the polls. \"There are 22 million veterans in America,\" he said. \"Our members are extremely diverse. A lot of them are independents, but they vote at over 90 percent. They're very influential in their communities.\" A few months later, veterans would vote for Trump by a two-to-one margin. Since becoming president, Trump has continued to make empty, ostentatious shows of support for the armed services. He regularly accuses NFL players of disrespecting the military as they protest police brutality during the national anthem. He ordered the Pentagon to plan an over-the-top military parade in Washington D.C., one that he ultimately canceled as costs ballooned. He has been known to literally hug the flag. At the same time, the Trump administration is working to prevent transgender Americans from serving their country. On Memorial Day he used dead soldiers as a means to tout his own accomplishments. ProPublica reported earlier this month that three members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club--a Marvel executive, a Palm Beach doctor and a lawyer--were essentially running the Department of Veteran Affairs despite having no relevant experience. A few days later, the administration announced its plan to stop checking for violations of the Military Lending Act, making it easier for financial predators to take advantage of service members and their families. The list goes on. This is the most inappropriate #MemorialDay comment that a @ POTUS has ever made. Self-promotion on a day to remember the fallen, and wishing those remembering their deceased loved ones a \"happy\" holiday is appalling. #CadetBoneSpurs pic.twitter.com/kRse4dnwiu--VoteVets (@ votevets) May 28, 2018 Veterans have long been used as political props, but never before has a politician failed to uphold so many baseline standards for decency toward those who have served. It hasn't seemed to matter, though. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, which vociferously condemned Trump's attacks on the Khan family, recently hosted the president in Missouri. The welcome was warm and, as expected, Trump mostly used the occasion to complain to the thousands of veterans assembled in front of him about how unfairly he has been treated by the media. He might as well have been talking to his supporters at one of his campaign-style rallies. Trump doesn't respect or care about veterans in any meaningful sense, and, as is the case with Trump's obstruction of justice and his campaign's collusion with Russia, the evidence is hiding in plain sight. His behavior is just so abhorrent that it's easier to find twisted ways to rationalize it rather than confronting the president's moral vapidity directly. \"Everyone keeps talking about this as breaking a taboo, crossing a line and doing something unprecedented,\" Maddow said while speaking with Reickhoff in 2016. \"Because of that we don't actually know what the response is. There's nothing like this in history to say this is the appropriate response or this is the equivalent political fate that befell somebody else who did this.\" The same is true two years later, and while the nation remains paralyzed in bewilderment, Trump continues to be president. His response to McCain's death won't be the last time he disrespects the military in service of a mind-numbingly petty grudge or the enrichment of the ruling class. Whenever that next time comes, America will once again be outraged. Now, however, it knows better than to think it will affect Trump at the polls."}, {"articleID": "2018040620_00068090_W", "names": {"Joe Greene": ["Q505256", "Q6210111", "Q982412"], "Franco Harris": ["Q1333547", "Q5868373"], "John Madden": ["Q1345694", "Q51516", "Q6246350", "Q945652"]}, "date": "2018-04-06", "url": "https://247sports.com/Bolt/WATCH-Pittsburgh-Steelers-Joe-Greenes-crazy-play-during-1974-season-117084762", "content": "WATCH: <mark>Joe Greene</mark>'s crazy play during 1974 season <mark>Joe Greene</mark> knew exactly what the Steelers needed during a 1974 matchup against the Cleveland Browns. Slot to 247Sports Links <mark>Joe Greene</mark> new exactly what the Pittsburgh Steelers needed during a 1974 matchup against the Cleveland Browns: points. Pittsburgh's offense was downright struggling against Cleveland, with starting quarterback Terry Hanratty throwing more interceptions (three) than completions (two) against the Browns' defense. With the Steelers' offense struggling, <mark>Greene</mark> made sure to make the most of his opportunity when Cleveland quarterback Brian Sipe fumbled while trying to pitch the ball to running back Billy Lefear. Instead of simply pouncing on the loose pigskin, <mark>Greene</mark> scooped up the ball and lateraled it to Pittsburgh cornerback J.T. Thomas. Thomas caught <mark>Greene</mark>'s toss and scampered into the end zone to give the Steelers a 23-16 fourth quarter lead. Pittsburgh would tack on a field goal to defeat the Browns, 26-16. When <mark>Joe Greene</mark> pitches you the??, you make sure to take it to the??. #tbt pic.twitter.com/9kgpwxFVft--Pittsburgh Steelers (@ steelers) April 5, 2018 The victory helped jumpstart a 4-1 finish to the regular season for the Steelers, who ended the 1974 regular season with a 10-3-1 record en route to winning the AFC Central division for the second time in three years. Pittsburgh would then dismantle O.J. Simpson and the Buffalo Bills in the first round to set up a matchup with the rival Raiders in the AFC Championship Game in Oakland. Pittsburgh had shocked Oakland two years earlier following <mark>Franco Harris</mark>' \"Immaculate Reception\" in the '72 divisional round, giving the Steelers their first-ever playoff victory. The Raiders got even by defeating the Steelers in the same round in the 1973 playoffs. While the Steelers were already itching at the chance to face the Raiders with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line, Oakland coach <mark>John Madden</mark> added some added incentive when he called his Raiders and the Miami Dolphins--the two time defending Super Bowl champions and the team Oakland defeated to get to the AFC title game--the two best teams in football. <mark>Madden</mark>'s comment did not sit well with Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll, who delivered a rare inspirational speech to his team before heading to Oakland to face the Raiders. \"People out in Oakland think that the two best teams in football played yesterday,\" <mark>Greene</mark> said while recalling Noll's speech in his book,. \"But you know what? The Super Bowl will be played in two weeks and the best team in football is sitting right here in his room.\" \"<mark>Joe Greene</mark>: Built By Football\" <mark>Greene</mark> said Noll's words changed the complexion of the Pittsburgh Steelers for good. \"When he said that,\" <mark>Greene</mark> wrote, \"the case was closed. I knew we were going to win. I believed him and he was right.\" Noll was right, as his super charged Steelers defeated the Raiders 24-13. They then defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX, as <mark>Greene</mark>, Noll and the rest of the Steelers were on their way to becoming the team of the decade by winning four Super Bowls in a six-year span.
