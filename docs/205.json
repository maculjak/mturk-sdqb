On May 24, <mark>Stewart</mark> was found dead of an apparent suicide in his jail cell. The state Department of Public Safety is investigating. Formal charges against <mark>Stewart</mark> are scheduled to be dismissed Tuesday in 2nd District Court. <mark>Stewart</mark> faced execution in the killing of officer Jared Francom, whose name is now on the Ogden Public Safety Building. On the one hand, the many websites and pages put up by <mark>Stewart</mark>'s family and supporters talk about getting money together for a memorial. They see him as the victim of the heavy-handed, jack-booted power of the state, even calling him a political prisoner in the war on drugs. On the other hand, police here are armoring up like never before. The gun battle at <mark>Stewart</mark>'s home a year and a half ago erupted as the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force broke down <mark>Stewart</mark>'s door, serving a \"knock and announce\" search warrant for his pot plants. Last August, four Weber police agencies formed the Tactical Operations Group, or TOG, essentially in response to the lessons of the <mark>Stewart</mark> raid. \"TOG was in the planning stages before <mark>Stewart</mark>,\" Sheriff Terry Thompson said, \"but that incident added to the urgency of getting it up and running .\" His agency, along with the police departments of Ogden, Roy and North Ogden, supply officers to the 40-member TOG, officers with extra training and gear in forcibly serving search warrants. \"<mark>Stewart</mark> is the new standard,\" said Lt. Troy Burnett, who administers the TOG. Meaning, he said, TOG squads will serve all warrants with full body armor and helmets as strict policy, regardless of whether the warrant is judged low or medium risk or is for a minor or major offense. The <mark>Stewart</mark> warrant was considered low risk, officers nonetheless entering the home with guns drawn but wearing Kevlar vests, no helmets. \"It's about what the next <mark>Stewart</mark> decides to do,\" Thompson said. \"This wasn't about marijuana. It was a violation of the law. They want to make it about marijuana, but we served a legal search warrant and got the shit shot out of us .\" The TOG is available to any police agency. Those forces are typically expected to adopt the TOG full-armor policy when supporting a TOG unit. Thompson said his agency is considering adopting that Tactical Operations Group policy as its own. <mark>Stewart</mark> supporters rallying online include marijuana decriminalization groups, as well as Second Amendment fans, but for the family, the issue isn't marijuana. It's not pot Erna <mark>Stewart</mark>, a sister-in-law who has emerged as the family spokesperson, says it's the proliferation of what they call \"home invasion raids .\" She said blame is easily assigned, \"but everyone had their faults that night,\" referring to Jan. 4, 2012. \"I just want people to admit that so we can heal. Our community has been ripped in two, and that's very hard. My faith in the system has been ruined. I don't like that either...\"I would like to have some peace officers come sit down and talk to me so I can have some hope .\" She said her brother-in-law's death in the jail still leaves her in tears every day. They buried <mark>Stewart</mark> in a private ceremony Tuesday, unannounced even to the web groups. The \"Supporters of <mark>Matthew Stewart</mark>\" Facebook page, for one example, counted 885 members as of Friday. Erna <mark>Stewart</mark> said the online pages will continue to raise awareness of the dangers of increasing numbers of the search warrant \"door kicks\" and other aggressive tactics. Concerns nationally The American Civil Liberties Union in April announced a nationwide study on the \"militarization\" of police. Law enforcement scholars point to a near doubling of \"SWAT-style\" raids nationally to near 80,000 a year since 2001 with the proliferation of armament grants to local police from the Department of Homeland Security. \"We're not going away,\" Erna <mark>Stewart</mark> said. \"There's no way I can stop now. People need to know what we know .\" As to the monument, honestly, we're so exhausted right now. We're still grieving. But we could do it, find a place, on private property. It would be amazing. \"The first mention of a possible <mark>Matthew Stewart</mark> memorial was made the day after <mark>Stewart</mark>'s death. A day later, seven people had pledged money for a memorial\" to mark this gross violation of human rights. \"They included Salt Lake lawyer Andrew McCullough, former Libertarian Party candidate for Utah attorney general. Todd Blair video Some on the <mark>Stewart</mark> sites enjoy savaging Burnett, the Tactical Operations Group administrator. Burnett is memorialized on YouTube in the September 2010\" no-knock \"raid by the strike force at the home of Todd Blair in Roy. In helmet-cam video later released to the media, Blair is seen being fatally shot three times as Burnett enters the front room some five seconds into the raid. Blair had a golf club raised over his head; Burnett said he thought Blair was brandishing a sword. Web comments attached to news stories over the years on the <mark>Stewart</mark> case inevitably included a link to the shooting on YouTube. Burnett's TOG has been called a death squad. Erna <mark>Stewart</mark> calmly said the TOG is a step in the wrong direction .\" We want to avoid being a negative site altogether if we are really going to make a positive change happen. \"She said she would like to hear from police opposed to strong-arm enforcement of the law. Bernie Allen, one of <mark>Stewart</mark>'s defense lawyers, said they're out there but are a minority .\" I get emails all the time from law enforcement officers who are very concerned about it, since this case and Blair's, \"Allen said .\" It's a handful, but there is concern, and prosecutors outside Weber County have expressed concerns. I hope that means something. \"The whole war on drugs is a horrendous way to look at this...why crash his house?\" he said of the <mark>Stewart</mark> case. \"Was he going to flush his 4-foot pot plants down the toilet?\" ' A minority view' A veteran former prosecutor is also concerned. \"I'm not taking sides on the <mark>Stewart</mark> case,\" said Camille Neider, former deputy Weber County attorney, now a defense attorney. \"I see good arguments and reasoning on both sides. But you have to ask, was that type of force necessary, legal or not, for someone growing pot in their basement?\" You have to balance on a scale. Like a child abduction, or a kidnapping, obviously you have to move quickly. But I don't think we need the TOG, another squad to kick in doors. \"But Thompson and other officials said they are not aware of any agencies that are considering cutting back, as a matter of policy or practice, on\" dynamic entries, \"as the door kicks are sometimes called. That includes the Ogden Police Department, said Lt. Chad Ledford. After the strike force's roughly 100-plus search warrants served a year, Ogden's force is typically next in volume with well under 100. TOG, Ledford said, fills a need for the warrant servicing that doesn't reach the danger level of needing a full SWAT callout .\" There's always the philosophical argument of \"Is it worth it?' But the Legislature makes the laws, and we have to enforce them .\" Ledford added that people are imagining \"we're booting doors in every day. That's not happening .\" \"A good portion of people answer the door. Only a small percentage require a breach .\" As to officers individually or personally rethinking door kicks for minor offenses such as pot plants, Ledford said, \"It's not the topic of conversation every day. But there are those who are wondering about it, if you look hard enough .\" Weber County Attorney Dee Smith, an ardent defender of the breaches as necessity, is not wondering. He even trained with the TOG, brandishing a firearm with \"sim rounds,\" plastic simulated bullets, and shouting \"Police - search warrant\" during door-kick drills. \"I wanted to understand the process they go through, what they face,\" Smith said. TOG squads are available for all agencies, all types of investigators, for serving warrants, \"even property crime detectives .\" He discounted the <mark>Stewart</mark> supporters: \"I don't see that as any kind of movement, just people with an agenda who are grabbing ahold of the <mark>Stewart</mark> case. But it's a minority view .\" Thompson concluded he's confident if there were problems or abuses with forceful serving of search warrants, the judiciary would remedy them. \"I know good people who are concerned about the breaches, and I still love 'em, they're still my friends .\" ", "articleID": "2013060213_00021099_W", "names": {"Matthew Stewart": ["Q43911030", "Q6791273"]}}, {"date": "2013-06-03", "url": "http://www.thisisanfield.com/2013/06/daniel-sturridge-ligament-damage-confirmed-lfc-striker-crisis/", "content": "Should Liverpool FC look to Germany for potential Summer signings?

There's plenty SMITH COUNTY (TYLER MORNING TELEGRAPH) - It was a high traffic day when a line of cars passed <mark>Tom Russell</mark>'s home along Farm-to-Market Road 2493, also known as Old Jacksonville Highway, in Gresham 30 years ago. Now, it's the norm. <mark>Russell</mark>'s driveway is situated where FM 2493's last expansion to five lanes coming south out of Tyler diverges into the two-lane road it was for decades. The road is a traffic bottleneck. But, the Texas Department of Transportation is planning a project to expand the five-lanes (two lanes each for south - and northbound traffic and a continuous left-hand turn lane) 2.2 miles to Farm-to-Market Road 346 in Flint. The project is still at least five years from beginning, but TxDOT officials are beginning to survey potential routes, rights of way needs and plan to meet with landowners along the proposed expansion Tuesday. <mark>Russell</mark> said the expansion would be a welcome relief for drivers commuting to and from dozens of surrounding subdivisions .\" When I look out the window in the morning sometimes, it's bumper to bumper, \"he said .\" There are a lot of frustrated drivers who will be happy (when the expansion is complete). \"<mark>Russell</mark> said the expansion will help alleviate traffic congestion but also make the road safer. Turning into his driveway is a\" look in the rearview mirror to see what's coming \"adventure at times. The danger comes when drivers heading south jockey for position as five-lanes become two. Wrecks and fender benders are common, he said .\" There are people screeching tires all the time, \"<mark>Russell</mark> said .\" The road changes abruptly, and it's a squeeze play when cars can't get over. \"In 2005, when the previous expansion of FM 2493 occurred, from Texas Highway 57 to FM 2813, 12,910 vehicles traveled the section, according to TxDOT. By 2011, daily counts reached more than 19,000. The section set for expansion had 8,750 daily vehicles in 2005 and 11,100 by 2011. The area along FM 2493 is buzzing with signs of growth. TxDOT Project Director Dale Booth said the continuation of the expansion is a result of continued residential and commercial growth along FM2493. Expectations are for Toll 49 to fuel growth in the area, he said. The preliminary meeting Tuesday will allow landowners along the route to express opinions and concerns regarding the expansion project and the department's options. Booth said the three options focus on which way the road will be widened. The road can be widened from the middle of the road equally on each side, or it could be widened from the east or west edge of the existing roadway, he said. Construction will depend on how the three options affect landowners along the route and TxDOT's ability to negotiate rights of way acquisitions. Rights of way acquisitions are expected to begin in 2016, Booth said. The\" best estimate \"for construction to begin is 2018 and end in 2020. <mark>Tom</mark> Mullins, president of the Tyler Economic Development Council, said development north of the planned expansion is evidence of the potential growth along FM 2493. He said the road is beginning to mirror development along Broadway Avenue. Many drivers are now using FM 2493 to avoid traffic on Broadway Avenue, which in turn stimulates commercial growth .\" Commercial and retail growth follows traffic and rooftops, \"he said .\" There's certainly a lot of activity and investment along Old Jacksonville, and it's moving south. \"Christoph Stockhammer, owner of Four Way Cafe, sees the growth potential in Flint. He's noticed TxDOT crews placing flags along the side of the road. His restaurant sits on the southeastern corner of the FM 2493-FM 346 crossroads .\" The growth potential is huge, \"he said of the area .\" Bigger stores are moving this way. That's a sign. \"The Tuesday meeting with TxDOT officials will be held at St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church, 18221 FM 2493 in Flint from 5 to 7 p.m. meta itemprop =\" datePublished \"content =\" 2013-06-03 13:15:05 \"> End of CSCOPE means hardship for some Texas schools by Morgan SmithAUSTIN (TEXAS TRIBUNE) - In late May, state Sen. <mark>Dan Patrick</mark>, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, announced what he called the end of an era in Texas public schools.

If he reckons we should go for someone I will back his judgement 100 per cent .\" As <mark>Paul Lambert</mark> plots the next phase of Villa's recruitment he can rely on a talent-spotter who puts <mark>Simon Cowell</mark> and Co to shame. <mark>Lambert</mark> uses Culverhouse as a sounding board for all transfer transactions and the right-hand man has an impressive track record for identifying potential signings, too. During their seven-year association at Wycombe, Colchester, Norwich and now Villa, Culverhouse has alerted <mark>Lambert</mark> to a host of promising players, who the Scottish boss has subsequently signed. <mark>Ashley Westwood</mark> is one such example, with Culverhouse spotting very early the ability the former Crewe midfielder is now showcasing on the Premier League stage. \"I remember Ian saying a few years back\" there's a lad at Crewe you should keep your eye on'. <mark>Ashley</mark> has been fantastic for us. \"It is not just player recruitment where <mark>Lambert</mark> trusts Culverhouse implicitly - their entire football philosophy has been in sync since teaming up at Wycombe in 2006. Culverhouse was a youth coach at Adams Park then, having made more moves during his fledgling coaching career than the loyal Norwich stalwart did during his playing days. Regarded as a Canaries legend for his part in their early 1990s heyday, the full-back-turned-sweeper spent almost a decade there, helping them challenge towards the top of the top-flight table and embark on a UEFA Cup adventure, including a famous victory over Bayern Munich. The former Tottenham trainee left to join Swindon in 1994, spent four years at the County Ground and then went to Brighton, where he hung up his playing boots in 2000. Seagulls boss <mark>Jeff Wood</mark> gave him his first taste of coaching with a backroom role and Culverhouse later returned the favour by recruiting him as Norwich's goalkeeping coach. After leaving Brighton, Culverhouse coached at Barnet and Leyton Orient, progressing to assistant manager under John Still and Martin Ling .\" Ian was an excellent coach but things broke down on a personal front between us, \"explained Ling, who replaced Culverhouse with <mark>Dean Smith</mark> - now Walsall manager - in August 2005. Culverhouse was snapped up by Wycome boss <mark>John Gorman</mark>, initially in a youth team capacity and continued in that post when <mark>Lambert</mark> took charge of the Chairboys in August 2006. Soon Culverhouse found a kindred spirit in <mark>Lambert</mark>, who elevated him to a first-team role. The pair have never looked back since. Through Culverhouse's experiences at Norwich and <mark>Lambert</mark>'s at Borussia Dortmund, the duo developed a philosophy based around a strong team ethic and giving unknown players a chance to shine. <mark>Lambert</mark> took Culverhouse to Colchester as his assistant in October 2008 and again to Norwich less than a year later. They inspired a rapid rise from League One lowliness to Premier League mid-table comfort. Culverhouse is trusted to take the lead in the Bodymoor Heath training sessions. Their rapport allows <mark>Lambert</mark> to get his ideas across to the squad, but still maintain a distance - an approach he picked up from managerial mentor and former Villa boss <mark>Martin O'Neill</mark>.\" One of the things the gaffer told me was \"don't let them hear your voice all the time every day because you'll want them to hear it and listen to it on Saturday\" ', said <mark>Lambert</mark> \"So at training Ian does the sessions and I walk around and tell the players if I don't think the standard is what it should be .\" Villa know all about assistant managers going out on their own as bosses from their European Cup triumph under <mark>Tony Barton</mark> in 1982 But while Culverhouse's brother David has dabbled with non-league management, the former right-back has previously spoken of his satisfaction at staying as a No. 2 for now. \"I'm quite happy with what I'm doing. I suppose it's something you'd like to do, to test yourself as No. 1 .\" said Culverhouse. \"But the freedom I get now is good enough for me. <mark>Paul</mark> and I have had a successful relationship, so it's not something I'm thinking about at the moment .\" Their close bond was evident when <mark>Lambert</mark> jumped on Culverhouse with a jubilant piggy-back celebration during the win over QPR, and the manager had no qualms about putting his No. 2 in charge when he served a touchline ban against Arsenal. So as Villa embark on another busy summer it is no surprise to learn <mark>Lambert</mark> once described Culverhouse as one of the best signings he has ever made. \"With the quality of the coaching, Ian has been equally as important as anybody who has ever played under me,\" beamed <mark>Lambert</mark>. \"I'm grateful to have such a good assistant. <mark>Lambert</mark> was pleased a dramatic upturn in form and fortunes guided Villa to Premier League safety during a testing first campaign at the club.
