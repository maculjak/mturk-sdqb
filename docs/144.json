from: a traveler to cairo and moscow dear sirs: you may think that the situations in egypt and russia have nothing in common. think again. yes, these two countries have starkly different histories. but having visited both in recent weeks, i can tell you that they have one very big thing in common: the political eruptions in both countries were not initially driven by any particular ideology but rather by the most human of emotions - the quest for dignity and justice. humiliation is the single most underestimated force in politics. people will absorb hardship, hunger and pain. they will be grateful for jobs, cars and benefits. but if you force people to live indefinitely inside a rigged game that is flaunted in their face or make them feel like cattle that can be passed by one leader to his son or one politician to another, eventually they'll explode. have you gentlemen looked at the homemade videos going viral around russia these days? one of my favorites was made by two russian paratroopers-turned-singers, posted on youtube under the title \"russian airborne veterans against vladimir putin .\" their lyrics were aimed directly at you, mr. putin, in the wake of the sept. 24 announcement that president medvedev would step down and pave the way for you and your party (now widely known as \"the party of crooks and thieves\" ) to run for president for two more six-year terms - 12 more years! russians immediately started calculating how old they'd be when they might see their country led by someone other than you, mr. putin. it was depressing for many - made more so by the fact that mr. medvedev said that your \"trading places\" was planned long ago. yet no one else was consulted, and you two didn't even bother to offer a narrative as to why putin should have 12 more years. aleksei navalny, the shareholder-activist-blogger who helped stoke the rallies against you, said to me that nothing spurred the protests more than the daily experience of muscovites having to sit in traffic while a car with a flashing blue light carrying some putin crony behind tinted glass speeds past. \"it is all about dignity,\" said navalny. \"who are these people? why don't they care about our rights? it doesn't matter at all how good a career you build. you will stand in this traffic, and these people and their sons will drive past you with their blue lights .\" mr. putin, you have substantial achievements. during your first eight years as president, starting in 2000, you stabilized a collapsing russia and oversaw the emergence of a big urban middle class. admittedly, you didn't achieve this with kid gloves, and it was attended with widespread corruption and fueled by oil exports. but enough trickled down so that a real middle class of professionals and entrepreneurs emerged. they are your accidental political offspring - \"maybe the first independent political class in modern russian history,\" says max trudolyubov, the editorial page editor of the vedomosti newspaper - and now they want a voice in their future. have you spoken lately to mikhail dmitriev, the president of the center for strategic research? the anti-putin protests, dmitriev found, were not driven by the unemployed but rather by \"the highly skilled part of the russian population\" that has come to feel as though \"russian society is a two-lane highway, with one lane for the privileged individuals in proximity to state power,\" with its own laws or lack of them, \"and one lane for the rest of the population .\" one phrase, he says, \"suddenly appeared all over the country:\" we are not cattle .' \"this, he says, is when he realized that\" this is a matter of dignity and self-respect. \"this struggle between you and your accidental offspring will play out over a long time. but, good sirs, have no doubt about this: politics is back in russia. watch out. you, mr. putin, will surely win the march presidential election, predicts dmitriev,\" but in a weakened way. \"the putin brand is declining, he says .\" the trend is downward. this will ensure that putin is a weak president with declining support. \"therefore, argues dmitriev, your only hope to remain relevant is to\" set up a coalition government, including the opposition, on the basis of free and fair elections and move toward a more balanced and competitive political system. \"sweet leaf hydro your online

"emerging markets are back on the investment radar for 2012 after a poor run in the latter half of last year, state street global advisor's chief investment officer for fundamental equities said on tuesday at a round-table discussion. while investment in those markets was overheated a year ago, the investment climate has since improved. in a press discussion at the firm's canary wharf tower, <mark>chris johns</mark> said that given the appetite for investment in emerging markets a year ago, it was \"almost inevitable\" that 2011 would be a less-than-stellar year. today, however \"the secular drivers of growth are still there. it's a good time to think of increasing emerging market exposure,\" he said. the msci emerging markets index dropped to a year low of 824.39 in october of 2011 after reaching a high of 1,211.98 in late april, according to bloomberg data. the index reached a 2012 high of 1053.13 on monday. state street global advisors had $21.8 trn in assets under custody and $1.9 trn in assets under management at the end of last year. the firm as a whole took a less apocalyptic view of the markets overall than many of its peers last year, three of ssga's cios said during the discussion, though the firm still went short on the euro versus the dollar and yen. <mark>johns</mark> said that ssga currently is overweight in us equities even though those stocks were slightly expensive, adding that many us businesses had recovered more rapidly than commentators had given then credit for. <mark>johns</mark> predicted that cheap, large, high-beta stocks were a good pick for 2012. the high dividend-paying stocks that clients requested intensely a year ago, are now \"overcooked,\" he said. richard lacaille, the fund manager's chief investment officer and <mark>kevin anderson</mark>, global chief investment officer of fixed income and currency both said they were more optimistic about the european market in the new year after the european central bank's long term refinancing operation improved confidence in the region. <mark>anderson</mark> said european banks' deleveraging was reducing the efficiency of the loan market and pushing more institutions into the bond market. as institutions' appetite for risk improves, he said they were likely to look increasingly towards the european high-yield bond market rather than just the us

"content": "the ecstasy and the agony of the internet celebrity youtube mega-celebrity, and thus she who often, in press accounts, gets the term \"internet sensation\" appended to her name--has, it turns out, a dad who is a wealthy internet entrepreneur. she has, it turns out, close ties to the music-industrial complex. she has, it turns out, hair that used to be blonde. lana del rey, in other words, is a pop musician who has been manufactured as a pop musician. in that, she is no different from beyonc? or gaga or madonna or any other musical act that has ever existed ever. music is manufacturing. music is performance. music is spectacle. it lives and dies on its ability to combine sincerity and falsity in approximately appropriate ratios. and so, inevitably, it has introduced many an artist to the business end of the hype cycle. lana, however, is different from her counterparts in one particular way: she found her current fame, such as it is, on youtube. she is not a celebrity so much as she is an internet celebrity. and, as an internet celebrity, lana-n? e-lizzie is not just a product; she is a possession. she is, in a very real sense, ours. we, the internet--we buzzing democracy of views and virality--created her. we have made her both what she is and more than what she is, 26 million youtube views. we have, link by link, converted lana del rey, the person, into lana del rey, the meme. which would be terrific for all involved--the singer gets her audience, the audience gets its singer--were it not for the fact that lana del rey is also, inconveniently, a person. she isn't a lolcat; she isn't an image that can be fractured and amended and replicated and transmitted at will. she is an artistic and aesthetic product, sure, but one that comes with an unavoidable narrative arc--an arc whose plot line, archived on the internet, involves past forays into the music business that were much less \"put it, when he\" exposed \"the indie singer for her non-indie past:\" meet lizzy grant. she had blonde hair, didn't look very \"alt sexy .' sorta like a girl from my high school who was a part-time hostess at chili's .\" the community that created lana del rey, in other words, turned on lana del rey. she became the digital version of the electrified dylan, with an invented name and an incorrect instrument. she was vilified for being the oldest and apparently the worst thing you can be in the music industry: inauthentic. even as a folk singer, greil marcus put it, dylan-n? - zimmerman was \"always suspect .\" he \"moved too fast, learned too quickly, made the old new too easily .\" del rey made her old new too easily. and with, it seems, a productive self-consciousness that edges her away from the sincerity of self-directed artistry...and toward something that seems more about commodity. her voice, my colleague spencer kornhaber has written, ranges \"from gloomy sigh to betty boop-ish squeal\" ; her persona, it seems, is equally variable. and so the singer broke the compact that was implied in her viral celebrity, which was that she would respect the platform, the internet, that created her in her current form. she used the internet's world--a world that prides itself on its meritocracy, that enables and ennobles organic self-expression--for the very analog purposes of album sales and album tours and but her fame was also a violation. the internet is not just a platform, but a culture, with norms and normativity. lana del rey, by trying to move beyond that culture, also betrayed it. \"people seem to feel that del rey is trying to trick us,\" sasha frere-jones you'd think, in this era of the facebook timeline--an era that finds us archiving our own evolutions in the vast scrapbook of the internet--we would be more tolerant of evolution in our celebrities. you'd think, actually, that we would celebrate it. and, to some extent, we do. madonna has made her history part of her current story. lady gaga's transformation from egg-dweller is there, on youtube, for all to see. as an internet celebrity, though, lana del rey lacks this privilege. she exists not merely for the internet; she is of it. we, the internet, are responsible for her. we are also culpable for her. and that means that we are invested in her authenticity--or in, more specifically, her ability to produce authenticity--more than we are in celebrities whose origin stories are of the analog world. we are increasingly aware of ourselves as taste-makers. what my colleagues are sharing on twitter, what my friends are listening to on spotify, what my neighbors are rating on yelp--these, increasingly, are determining the products i choose to consume, as well. their choices are influencing mine, explicitly. which means that our choices, collectively, take on the freight of intellectual implication. my friends are not just my friends, but my filters. they play a curatorial role in my online life, just as i play one in theirs. and: we are all increasingly conscious of the curatorial role we are playing in each others' lives. this invests us much more in the things and the people we endorse. and it means that authenticity becomes not just a matter of subjective value, but of collective. we get to decide, we tell ourselves, whether lana del rey is sincere in the art she produces for us. because to be true to herself means also to be true to us, her audience and her enablers. the singer's most recent album, the one enabled by the internet, is titled born to die. it seems appropriate. we already have tough

at christchurch mayor <mark>bob parker</mark>, after calling him a \"clown\". his comments, reported in yesterday's christchurch mail, were a reaction to the mayor's statement last week that cera could force the city to increase rates or sell assets to pay for the earthquake recovery. mr brownlee told the mail he was furious at the mayor's comments and was a \"clown\" for making the remark. he dismissed mr <mark>parker</mark>'s assertion, saying the cera act specifically forbids such a move. section 48, clause 3 of the act states the minister \"must not direct any council to (a) set a rate under section 23 of the local government (rating) act 2003\". mr brownlee described mr <mark>parker</mark>'s comments as an \"outrageous abdication\" of his responsibilities and he was sick and tired of the scrapping between city councillors. he was not surprised ratepayers were fed up with the way christchurch was being run. mr brownlee told the press last night the \"clown\" remark was \"probably over the top\" , but said he was frustrated with mr <mark>parker</mark> and the council's problems. the mayor is in china and has not responded. this morning he told radio new zealand the \"clown\" comment was taken out of context. \"in the context that i made that comment, i was making another comment about the general performance of the council over the most difficult period that they had a couple of weeks ago .\" i think that they are under considerable pressure to deliver all sorts of services, but it is plain and obvious that it is going to be difficult for them to do so. they do have to work with us. that doesn't mean that they just stump up and put a bill in front of us - they have to work with us. \"mr brownlee revealed the council asked him to exempt the council-owned orion from monopoly controls, so power bills could be increased under earthquake emergency laws. he said he has never said rates must be increased or assets sold to meet council costs .\" the government is spending a lot of money we've been trying our best to move things on, it's undeniable we've had a christchurch city council that has not performed as well as it could - so my comments came at the time we were into reasonably significant negotiations with them over how we were going to help with the huge call that they are going to have on their resources going forward.

shines through the daredevil downhill skier in him still craves going fast even if his body no longer permits it. once helped into his motorized scooter, former olympic champion <mark>bill johnson</mark> races through the halls of an assisted living facility in gresham, ore., hardly ever backing off the accelerator. well, until he's ordered to slow down by the nursing staff. a series of strokes have all but immobilized the skier who once lived life on the edge, whose brash confidence, movie-star charisma and rebellious attitude made him a fan favorite at the 1984 sarajevo olympics, where he became the first american to capture the downhill crown. in 2001, johnson attempted to regain his glory and made a comeback at the u.s. championships at age 40, with grand visions of earning a spot on the squad for the 2002 salt lake city games. only, johnson wiped out during a practice run, suffering a traumatic brain injury that erased nearly a decade of memories. he also had to learn how to walk, talk and eat again. he had made steady improvement over the years, even returning to the slopes for recreation. but johnson's health has been slowly on the decline because of mini strokes. then, nearly two years ago, he had a major stroke that stole the rest of his body. now, his speech is slurred, he can't sit up on his own, his left eyelid doesn't open and only his left hand is operational. that's his steering hand for his powered chair, enabling him to make those mad dashes down to the cafeteria for coffee. he definitely misses the thrill of speed - any kind of speed. there are no reminders of his past hanging on the walls in his room, nor any trophies on the shelf. he prefers it that way. most of those trinkets are neatly boxed up at his mom's house - waiting to be passed along to his children - along with his gold medal, which is tucked away in a safe. johnson still eagerly watches downhill races on television, perking up when bode miller flies out of the starting gate. johnson will follow along, his eyes visualizing the moves as miller carves his way through the course. johnson used to ski a lot like miller - with a gambler's mentality and a resolve to take risks that few others would. indeed, his mind still races, even if his body can't. these days, johnson, who turns 52 at the end of march, spends most of his time confined to his wheelchair or his bed, playing video games or watching game shows. his mom, d.b., frequently drops by to check on him. she used to care for her son at the family home, but his current health has made that impractical. johnson has stopped going to physical therapy, because he doesn't see any reason for it. \"he knows he's not improving,\" his mom said. \"he doesn't like to be fussed over .\" communicating for johnson has become a labored task. so much so that his mom frequently serves as his translator, especially when he can't vocalize his needs - like wanting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from the kitchen - to the staff. that's been frustrating. the personable johnson has always enjoyed chatting, especially about skiing. does watching ski racing take him back to his glory days? \"yes,\" he whispered in the background as his mother held the phone. enjoy watching lindsey vonn and miller race? \"yes,\" he softly said. were you the pioneer that opened up downhill skiing for the americans? a pause. then a chuckle. \"yep,\" he answered. that olympic downhill run in sarajevo nearly 28 years ago was electric as he effortlessly glided through the course, holding off the austrians whom he had infuriated with his bravado leading up to the race. \"what he did that day was amazing at the time,\" said bill marolt, president and ceo of the u.s. ski and snowboard association. \"in retrospect, it's still amazing .\" same with his story. always a gifted skier, johnson had a wild streak that had him careening down the wrong path. caught stealing cars as a teenager, the judge gave him a choice: attend ski school or head to jail. so he went to mission ridge ski academy in washington, where he discovered that, when dedicated, he had potential. lots of it, even, as he earned a europa cup crown. johnson made his first world cup start in february 1983, taking sixth at a downhill in st. anton, austria. a year later in wengen, switzerland, he captured his first big-league race. despite his short time on the circuit, johnson was one of the favorites heading into the olympics - and he let everyone know it. he had a knack for getting under the skin of european skiers, maybe even a few coaches along the way, too. winning that day in sarajevo was the pinnacle of his career. johnson won twice more that season, but wouldn't step on the world cup podium again. and three years after his debut on the scene, he made his last world cup appearance, finishing seventh in the downhill at whistler. still, he became an iconic figure to many americans. \"they related to billy - that brash, throw-it-in-your-face type attitude,\" said phil mahre, who won the olympic slalom in' 84. \"when you tell people you're going to go do something and then you go out and back it up like in sarajevo, it's pretty impressive .\" johnson went through knee and back injuries that curtailed his career and prevented him from defending his title at the 1988 calgary olympics. \"it would've been great if he would've kept the charge going,\" mahre said. \"i think it all came too quickly, it all came too easily. then it left just as quickly and just as easily .\" soon after, johnson's life began to unravel. he lost his first son, ryan, at 13 months old in a hot tub accident and went through a divorce a few years later. he drifted, not really sure what to do next. then, inspiration hit. a way to get his life back on track the only way he knew how - make the olympic team. \"he loved the downhill,\" his mom said. \"that was his life. that's the reason he went back. he was going to try to do it again. he could've done it .\" at the u.s. championships near whitefish, mont., johnson was speeding down the course at close to 60 mph when he entered a twisting section. he lost his balance, did the splits and slammed face first into the snow, biting off a chunk of his tongue as he flew through two sets of safety netting. he needed a breathing tube at the mountain and then was quickly transported to a hospital by helicopter. \"the doctors didn't think he was going to make it,\" said attorney and good friend harold burbank, who oversees the <mark>bill johnson</mark> special needs trust project which raise money for his care. he did, bucking long odds. but he sustained permanent brain damage. for three years after the accident, johnson stayed with his mom as he recovered. then, he moved into a trailer home to regain some of his independence. he even returned to the slopes - for fun. in january 2008, he slowly started losing the use of his right side. he was having mini strokes, the doctors eventually concluded. then, he had an even more debilitating stroke, all but immobilizing him. \"some days are really good days,\" his mom said. \"some days are not so good .\" the good days are when his sons, nick, 19, and tyler, 17, stop by for a visit. \"that lights him up,\" his mom said. so does conversing about skiing, his mom close by to relay his words. you had a unique way of attacking a course, huh? \"yes,\" he said. what do you want people to remember about <mark>bill johnson</mark>? \"best american skier,\" he said. anything people can do for you? a pause. then a chuckle. \"send candy,\" he said. sochi olympics downhill course gets high marks krasnaya polyana, russia (ap) - didier cuche called it \"magnificent .\" bode miller was highly critical. aksel lund svindal said the course for the 2014 sochi olympics was \"what downhill is all about .\" racers mainly gave high marks to the rosa khutor slope after the opening world cup training session was held under clear sunshine and good snow conditions. \"it's a magnificent course,\" said cuche, the four-time winner of the world cup downhill title, who finished second to austria's hannes reichelt on wednesday. \"perhaps a little bit too turning, it could be adapted a little bit to change that. the first 40 seconds or so it resembles more a super-g than a downhill, albeit a very fast super-g .\" it's not like any other run on the circuit, \"said cuche, who plans to retire after this season .\" it's a really interesting run. they have managed to shape the course around the mountain in a really nice way. \"however, miller said the constant turns on the upper section are too much like super-g .\" i don't really believe it embodies anything that a true world cup downhill should be, \"said the 34-year-old american, who would compete in his fifth olympics. training sessions are scheduled for thursday and friday before a world cup downhill on saturday and a super-combined race on sunday - the first major test events for the sochi games. at 2.2 miles, the course is one of the longer layouts that skiers have faced, although the constant turns mean little time in the tuck position. therefore, it's not one of the most physically demanding tests .\" if they ran that as the olympic super-g it would be an epic super-g, because it's not that tiring, even for the amount of time that you're on the course, \"said miller, who cruised down in 32nd place .\" it's just cranking turns the whole way on that good, hard snow. \"miller lamented the lack of gliding sections, where he usually excels .\" there's not one place where you're not going hard edge-to-edge except for this road just before this second-to-last jump into the finish, \"he said .\" because you're so tall and you're legs are long, you're not tucking at all. \"the upper half of the course contains a series of technical, narrow and steep turns before easing out toward the end, although there are large jumps all the way down, including one into the finish .\" it's a tough course, \"said svindal, the two-time overall world cup winner from norway .\" i think a lot of guys were surprised at inspection this morning. \"it's kind of what downhill is all about - the mountain kind of sets the pace,\" svindal added. \"if this was gliding from the top then we would kill ourselves after 20 seconds, so i'm glad they put some turns in there .\" svindal thought organizers injected too much water to make the upper portion of the course harder. \"it's a tough course - that's the bottom line - but the course preparation really makes a (difference),\" said the norwegian, who placed 21st. \"i think they overdid it with the water this time. they'll probably use less water for the olympics .\" svindal's biggest complaint was about the poorly organized charter planes that the international ski federation (fis) used to transport athletes to russia. he and other skiers said they were given no food or water for six hours from the time they began their trip from zurich on tuesday. \"if we knew, we would have brought something, but information was limited,\" svindal said. the u.s. ski team avoided the charter route and flew from europe by private jet, part of a training arrangement with the russian ski federation. \"it was cool to be able to fly here in style,\" said giant slalom world champion ted ligety. construction is everywhere, all the way up to the ski course finish area, which is located halfway up the mountain and requires two gondolas and a windy chairlift for fans and media. the skiers and the fis officials seem pleased, so far. \"this is the training of the test event, so this is round 1, day 1 - we're as green as green gets,\" said men's world cup finish area director mike kertesz. \"i don't mean to pat our own backs, but with all the work we've done so far, things are running according to the way they should, or even better than i've seen a brand new organizer do before .\" --andrew dampf reichelt tops first dh training on sochi 2014 course krasnaya polyana, russia (ap) - hannes reichelt of austria led the opening world cup training session on the 2014 sochi olympics downhill course on wednesday. with bright sunshine and good, hard snow conditions, reichelt clocked 2 minutes, 12.91 seconds down the steep and technical rosa khutor slope. skiers said the course requires allaround skills because it was so technical, with few gliding sections. that fits reichelt, who has won four world cup super-gs and one giant slalom, plus posted three podium results in downhill. swiss standout didier cuche, who has announced he will retire at the end of this season, was second, 0.25 seconds behind, and benjamin thomsen of canada was third, 0.69 behind. more training sessions are scheduled before before racing begins on saturday. olympics rio 2016 adds nissan as local olympic sponsor sao paulo (ap) - rio olympic organizers added nissan as the fifth top-tier sponsor for the 2016 games. organizers didn't disclose financial details, but said wednesday the deal with the car maker for the olympic and paralympic games exceeded \"the requirements from rio 2016 for the category .\" the committee said nissan will provide 4,500 vehicles to transport athletes, officials and journalists during the games. nissan is the sixth domestic sponsor for the games. the others are bradesco, bradesco seguros, claro and embratel. the sole tier-two sponsor is ernst & young terco. rio 2016 olympic committee president carlos nuzman said during a news conference in rio that the games have surpassed the initial goal of $570 million in sponsors. the mark had already been surpassed before the nissan deal, according to the committee. the current worldwide olympic partners for the 2016 games are coca-cola, atos, dow, ge, mcdonald's, omega, panasonic, procter & gamble, samsung and visa. \"this partnership demonstrates the value of the rio 2016 brand and the strength and attractiveness of the brazilian consumer market,\" nuzman said. \"after six months of negotiations that also involved other applicants, nissan submitted a proposal that ensures a consistent mix of products, services and financial backing, proving to be the ideal automotive partner .\" nissan said it has a plan to support local organizers' goals, including a program to support young athletes, promote the games' legacy and marketing ideas \"to spread the olympic experience .\" \"our multiple connections with brazil are deep,\" nissan president and chief executive carlos ghosn said in a statement. \"as a showcase for the energy and vision of brazil, the olympic games are a natural fit for nissan .\" organizing committee ceo leonardo gryner said the deal with nissan

cycling officials: longo's husband arrested over epo buy paris (ap) - french police raided the home of cycling great jeannie longo on wednesday and arrested her husband on suspicion that he bought doses of the banned performance-enhancer epo. the 53-year-old longo was expected to be questioned following the arrest of her husband and coach, patrice ciprelli, at their home in saint-martin-le-vinoux in the french alps, said police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case. another french official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said ciprelli was suspected of buying epo over the internet in the past two years. his arrest came three months after the french cycling federation cleared longo of breaching anti-doping rules in an embarrassing blow for france's anti-doping agency. prosecutors in the alpine city of grenoble are handling the case. france's police agency responsible for anti-doping investigations, oclaesp, also was involved. calls to longo's home went unanswered. ciprelli was suspended by the french cycling federation last september over allegations he bought epo. that prompted longo to pull out of last year's road world championships in holte, denmark. longo's list of titles covers nine pages in \"jeannie by longo,\" her biography. longo won gold at her fourth olympics, at atlanta in 1996. she also has two olympic silvers and one bronze, 13 world titles, 58 french titles and world records. in an ap interview in february 2011, longo's response was ambiguous when asked whether doping might be part of her longevity in cycling. she explained that there are no level playing fields in sports \"because we all do what we can to be better .\" --jamey keaten horner expected to compete in tour of california los angeles (ap) - defending champion chris horner and three-time winner levi leipheimer are expected to be in the field for the 2012 amgen tour of california, which will include a 130-mile fourth stage that will make for the race's longest day. the seventh annual race, scheduled may 13-20, is expected to include about 140 of cycling's top riders. the roughly 800-mile route, which was announced wednesday, will begin in santa rosa, calif., and take riders into the rolling <mark>hills</mark> of sonoma county. the fourth stage will take riders from sonora to clovis during the race's longest day. the concluding eighth stage begins on rodeo drive in <mark>beverly hills</mark> and finishes in downtown los angeles. participating teams and individual riders will be announced in the weeks just prior to the race. boonen wins fourth stage, closer to fourth qatar title doha, qatar (ap) - tom boonen edged closer to winning his fourth tour of qatar title when he grabbed the fourth stage ahead of tom veelers and fabian cancellara on wednesday. riding under clear skies unlike the previous day, boonen timed his sprint to perfection, winning the 90-mile stage at madinat al shamal in the northern tip of qatar. boonen also won the second stage this week and has won 20 overall in qatar. rowing women, men share billing in boat race on thames london (ap) - women will be given equal billing with men in the annual boat race between english universities oxford and cambridge, staging the women's race on the same day and the same course as the men's event starting in 2015. organizers said the races on the river thames in london will give the women's race a higher profile and some much-needed funding. the 4? - mile men's race from putney to mortlake, which was first staged in 1829, is broadcast to 200 countries. the 1.2-mile women's race gets little media attention and has been held further down the thames in nearby henley for the past 35 years. the decision to grant parity between the sexes in funding and coverage follows the path set by tennis, where equal prize money is offered at the grand slam tournaments. \"i'm thrilled that the women's boat race will be given equal parity with the men's,\" said annabel vernon, a rower with britain's national team. \"this provides a massive opportunity to grow women's rowing in this country .\" four-time olympic gold medalist matthew pinsent said its a major advance for equality in the sport. \"we have had women's events at the henley royal regatta for 10 years or so now, but this is an important step for what is one of the pre-eminent rowing races in the world and pre-eminent sporting fixtures in the world,\" pinsent said. female rowers have struggled in the shadows of the men for years, and were only allowed to race in olympics starting in 1976. \"the women's boat club doesn't have nearly the same coaching or logistical infrastructure behind them - they cycle to training, they have to run their own cars to drive to a race, they have to buy their own kit and pay for their own entry fees,\" pinsent said. \"this comes at a good time because there has been all this discussion about women in sport - it's a good moment to be welcoming them .\" female crews will be asked to row a course nearly four times the length of their usual race, providing them with a huge challenge. \"we thought about - and quickly rejected - whether it should be in any way different from the men's race,\" said <mark>robert gillespie</mark>, chairman of the boat race company. \"it's everybody's intention that it should be exactly the same .\" helena morrissey, the chief executive of women's race sponsor newton investment management group, has been the driving force behind gaining equality in the event. \"it is exciting to have the opportunity to fund a program which is making a real difference to university and women's rowing, as well as women's sport more generally,\" said morrissey, who was a cox when she studied at cambridge. this year's men's race will be held on april 7 .--steve douglas swimming phelps using hyperbaric chamber to aid recovery new york (ap) - michael phelps is the latest athlete to use a hyperbaric chamber to aid his recovery from training. the 16-time olympic medalist said wednesday he had been sleeping \"at 8,000 feet every night\" for almost a year. the 26-year-old swimmer noticed he bounced back from workouts better when he trained at altitude, so he's trying a device that simulates that. \"we've been able to realize after going to colorado springs so many times that it is something that helps me recover,\" phelps said. \"that's something that is so important to me now being older. i don't recover as fast as i used to .\" he said the chamber looked like a fish tank: \"imagine, like, a bed with a box around it .\" \"it's kind of strange, but it's good,\" phelps said during an appearance for sponsor head & shoulders. \"i don't mind it. there's a giant door at the end of my bed. the worst thing is trying to watch tv in it. i've got to watch it through plexiglas - it's blurry .\" phelps is preparing for what he says will be his final olympics this summer in london. he won a record eight gold medals in beijing in 2008. hypoxic or hyperbaric tents and chambers are used by many athletes to replicate high-altitude conditions and boost levels of oxygen-rich red blood cells. they have become popular with nfl players trying to speed their recovery from injuries. copyright? 2008. the contents of this website may
