Most people estimate that they consume around 2,600 calories on Christmas Day, but in reality the figure is closer to 6,000. That is the equivalent of 12 Big Macs, and three times the daily recommended amount of calories for a woman, and just under 2 and a half more than a man's. A survey of 2,000 UK adults also showed that 46 per cent us don't consider the amount we eat on Christmas Day, or any other day of the year. It also revealed that half of us are ditching the traditional Christmas turkey meal on 25 December. London pub's offer to feed the homeless Christmas dinner goes viral Despite dessert being a big part of the meal, the poll showed that only 29 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 will eat Christmas pudding, compared to 61 per cent of those aged 55 years old and over which, indicates the reign of the fruit-filled desert may soon be over. Unsurprisingly, alcoholic tipples also play a major part in the season's festivities. A third of Brits plan to guzzle red or white wine this year, a quarter will celebrate with sparkling wine, and a fifth will opt for beer or lager.

In sum, the preponderance of the evidence has not shown that you are responsible for any of the charged violations of the Code,\" retired Florida Supreme Court chief justice Major B. Harding wrote in his findings in the case, according to a document obtained by the Orlando Sentinel. Attorney David Cornwell, Winston's attorney during the hearing process, was the first to post the news on Twitter, listing a portion of the hearing finding. Winston partook in a two-day hearing Dec. 2-3 to determine whether he violated sexual misconduct and endangerment provisions in FSU's code of conduct policy during an alleged sexual assault in December 2012. The hearing spanned at least 12 hours. Winston's accuser has the option to appeal the ruling, although FSU's code of conduct provisions do not allow for entire hearing to be conducted again with a different panel. Harding indicated in his ruling the lack of witnesses beyond Winston and his accuser had an impact on his decision. \"1/8The accuser's 3/8 statements concerning the night's events have changed over time, but you one point on which she has remained steadfast is that once in your room that you had sexual intercourse with her and that she did not consent to or actively participate in the intercourse .\" You, however, vehemently contradict 1/8the accuser's 3/8 recitation of the night's events. \"Harding later stated,\" the evidence regarding the events that unfolded between you and 1/8the accuser3/8 once in your room are irreconcilable. In light of all the circumstances, I do not find the credibility of one story substantially stronger than that of the other. Both have their own strengths and weaknesses. I cannot find with any confidence that the events as set forth by you, 1/8the accuser3/8 or a particular combination thereof is more probable than not as required to find you responsible for violations of the code. Therein lies the determinative factor of my decision. \"Harding reviewed more 1,000 pages worth of evidence, including files originally generated during a sexual assault criminal investigation. Winston did not answer questions during the hearing but read a five-page written statement, a source told the Sentinel .\" Rape is a vicious crime, \"Winston's statement obtained by the Sentinel read .\" The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape. 1/8The accuser3/8 and her lawyers have falsely accused me, threatened to sue me, demanded $7,000,000 from me, engaged in a destructive media campaign against me, and manipulated this process to the point that my rights have and will continue to be severely compromised. \"1/8The accuser's 3/8 and her lawyers' public campaign to vilify me guarantees that her false allegations will follow me for the rest of my life .\" Winston's accuser, a former FSU student who withdrew from school once the charges became public, was also present for the hearing although she never was in the same room as Winston. It marks the second time Winston has been cleared in connection with the sexual assault allegation. State Attorney Willie Meggs opted not to pursue criminal charges against Winston in December 2013, citing insufficient evidence and issues with the timeline of the police investigation.

At election time, candidates seduce us with promises to bring America together, but inevitably fall short and end up leaving office with the country more polarized than when they arrived. After blaming them for their failure to unite us, we turn to the next crop of presidential aspirants and the cycle of hope and disappointment begins all over again. The latest example of this pattern, of course, is President Obama. His 2008 campaign was premised on his ability to forge new coalitions in Washington, which Hillary Rodham Clinton mocked at the time as \"Let's get everybody together, let's get unified, the sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing .\" In office, though, he has never succeeded in overcoming Republican resistance to his agenda, forcing him to pass his most significant legislative accomplishments with few or no GOP votes. After his party's decisive defeat in last month's midterm elections, the administration has now largely given up on the pursuit of bipartisan dealmaking and is pursuing its policy goals on issues like immigration and the environment through executive action. The debate over why Obama failed to achieve some larger consensus has already begun. Some have suggested that if only he had not pursued health care reform or had a less detached and analytical personal style he might have won over the public and his opponents in Congress. It may be true that Obama has made mistakes, but our disappointment with him ultimately reflects the mismatch between our expectations for presidents and the partisan realities of the contemporary era. The public and the news media still want someone who meets the mid-20th-century ideal for a modern president: a uniting figure who works across the aisle to build support for his agenda and commands public opinion from the bully pulpit. While this image was always mostly a myth - presidents typically struggle to move polls or legislators' votes - the political realities of the time did allow presidents to build more diffuse coalitions in Congress and attract broad public support when the circumstances were favorable. However, the political system that helped enable this approach is disappearing. The mid-20th century was a historical anomaly - a low point in polarization that was made possible by the ugly history of race in this country, which enabled the rise of a group of conservative Southern Democrats who functioned almost as a third party. After the civil rights movement, the parties realigned on the issue of race, setting in motion a return to the historic norm of polarization that prevailed in the late 19th and early 20th century. This process, which is transforming all of our nation's political institutions, has been supercharged by the way the parties have become more closely aligned with ideological movements than ever before. A result is what the political scientist Richard Skinner calls the partisan presidency. In this era, presidents are dividers, not uniters (to reverse Bush's famous phrase); their public appeal is deeply polarized along party lines and they depend overwhelmingly on the support of co-partisans in Congress to enact legislation. They are particularly vulnerable to obstruction from the opposition party, which can withhold support as congressional Republicans have done, denying the president the imprimatur of bipartisanship and producing legislative gridlock for which the president is often blamed. That's why it's a mistake to personalize Obama's failures so much, as his critics often do. Critics suggest that Obama is too aloof and hasn't done enough to solicit Republican support or build relationships with legislators. Both may be true, but as <mark>John Harwood</mark> recently noted in the New York Times, Bill Clinton's more successful outreach to his opponents didn't keep him from getting impeached. Likewise, Bush was more gregarious than Obama, but it didn't make him any more popular among Democrats once the post-9 / 11 glow had worn off. It's a common mistake to attribute other people's behavior to their inherent characteristics in this way. We seem especially prone to this pattern, which is known as fundamental attribution error, with presidents. But as recent history shows, our current political system tends to produce division and conflict no matter the circumstances. Comedian Chris Rock is ahead of most political analysts in recognizing this new reality. In a recent interview, he described how Bush adapted to this new political environment, saying Bush \"only served the people who voted for him .\" \"He literally operated like a cable network,\" he added, while Obama is \"a network guy .\" He explained: \"He's trying to get everybody. And I think he's figured out, and maybe a little late, that there's some people he's never going to get .\" As we approach the next presidential campaign, we need to stop asking who can achieve the unity that has eluded Obama. For better or worse, the partisan presidency is here to stay. There are some people the next president will never get, as Rock puts it. The question we should ask instead is whether the candidate we choose will - or can - govern well without their support. Alerts Text message notifications of news happening now.
