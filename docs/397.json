Trump took several days to specifically address the hate groups' actions but in a recent press conference said there were \"very fine people\" on both sides of the conflict. On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke out about Trump's refusal to fully condemn the hate groups who participated, saying, \"President Trump this afternoon gave a press conference that can only be described as clinically insane .\" Meyers went on to highlight Trump's comparison of a Confederate general to George Washington. He also highlighted White House Chief of Staff <mark>John Kelly</mark>'s slumped posture during the speech. The late-night host joked, \"Trump is so fully out of his mind he broke a general. That guy's been in wars .\" Seth Meyers ended his segment, titled \"Breaking Crazy,\" with a call to Congress to \"cut bait\" on the President.

(AP)--The school that once produced <mark>Chris Canty</mark> and Thorpe Award winner Terence Newman has struggled to defend in recent years in the pass-happy Big 12. It still draws Kansas State coach <mark>Bill Snyder</mark>'s ire. The hard-to-please Hall of Fame coach was often quick to bemoan a bunch that allowed 272.7 yards per game through the air last season, better only than the sieve known as Texas Tech. Their shortcomings were only made worse when they were forced to stand beside by the Wildcats' staunch rush defense, which was by far the best in the Big 12. But the Wildcats harbor hope for success this season. They return D.J. Reed, the league's defensive newcomer of the year, and running mate Duke Shelley at cornerback. Two-year starter Kendall Adams is back to anchor the safety corps, while a host of experience headlined by Cre Moore, Sean Newlan and Denzel Goolsby provide plenty of depth. Throw into the mix Elijah Walker, the third-ranked junior college safety last season, and some think Kansas State could have the best secondary in the Big 12--perhaps even the nation. \"I've seen it all happen, the good and the bad,\" said Shelley, who burned his redshirt as a freshman in 2015 when injuries forced him onto the field. \"Really for us as a unit as well, we went from nobody respecting us to,\" Wow, our unit is getting some love and respect we deserve .' We knew we deserved it. \"Now it's time to keep it. Things started promisingly enough for Kansas State last season, holding Stanford in check in the opener on the road and shutting down Florida Atlantic and Missouri State. But concerns arose when Skylar Howard threw for 298 yards in West Virginia's comeback victory, and they had a full-scale problem the following two games against Texas Tech and Oklahoma. First-round draft pick <mark>Patrick Mahomes</mark> II torched the Wildcats for 504 yards and two touchdowns, while the Sooners' Baker Mayfield had 346 yards and four TDs passing in a 38-17 rout. The key is to prevent a similar downturn this season .\" When you have a decent number of returning starters and returning players, the general public will probably say if you have a lot of people coming back then you will have an even better football team, \"<mark>Snyder</mark> said .\" We were pretty decent at the end of the season last year, so there is great expectation. \"There is nothing wrong with that. That is great,\" he continued. \"The key element is you have to do something about it. You just can't be a returning starter or guy that played an awful lot and the same coaches coming back, etcetera. You have heard me say so many times, every season presents new dynamics .\" One of those dynamics is the schedule. Kansas State opens Sept. 2 against Central Arkansas, then plays Charlotte the following week. It gives the secondary ample opportunity to come together before a trip to Vanderbilt. But the Commodores are no real threat through the air, ranking 100th out of 128 teams in passing offense a year ago. Throw in a week off after the nonconference schedule and the Wildcats should have hit their stride before the Big 12 slate opens with games against Baylor, Texas and TCU. High-powered Oklahoma looms Oct. 21 in a game that could help decide the conference race. \"As long as they keep working, having daily improvement, stay together, play together, we will find replacements for those five or six guys we lost,\" Kansas State defensive coordinator <mark>Tom Hayes</mark> said not only of his secondary but the entire unit. \"It's our job as coaches to identify them and certainly the players' job to go earn them .\" ___ More AP college football: http: //collegefootball.ap.org and https: //twitter.com/AP_Top25 Like this: Like Loading...Related Related Posts Kansas State and Kansas football both land players on preseason watch lists Jesse Ertz receives two more honors heading into 2017 <mark>Bruce Weber</mark> and Kansas State agree on two-year contract extension <mark>Snyder</mark>, Ertz could give K-State another winning combo Advertisement", "articleID": "2017081720_00160770_W", "names": {"Bill Snyder": ["Q17388778", "Q4910936"], "Bruce Weber": ["Q4135170", "Q991871"], "Chris Canty": ["Q3675459", "Q5106084"], "Patrick Mahomes": ["Q11329045", "Q19667998"], "Tom Hayes": ["Q19668361", "Q21597864", "Q22087172", "Q22945088", "Q3777584", "Q7816126", "Q7816129", "Q7816130", "Q7816131"]}}, {"date": "2017-08-18", "url": "http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/state/wire/the-latest-conference-of-mayors-supports-anti-hate-pact/article_cecbe996-10e3-5ad1-bb35-7ebb034087d8.html", "content": "The Latest: Conference of Mayors supports anti-hate pact 9 min ago (...)

The mayors announced the compact Friday on a conference call with the Anti-Defamation League, which is a partner in the effort. The compact lists 10 components, including rejecting white supremacism and extremism, celebrating diversity, and ensuring public safety while protecting free speech. During the call, Republican Mayor Shane Bemis of Gresham, Oregon, said the compact was needed because President Donald Trump failed to \"exhibit moral clarity\" when he blamed both sides for the violence last weekend in Charlottesville during clashes between white nationalists and counter protesters.

The City of Manassas, Virginia, is canceling an upcoming Civil War Weekend, citing a desire not to exacerbate recent tension over Civil War monuments.

Manassas spokeswoman Patty Prince said the city has hosted the weekend since 2011, when it was launched in connection with the 150th anniversary of the Civil War.

The Manassas area was host to two major Civil War battles .------1:30 p.m. Hundreds of anti-racist demonstrators are marching through the streets of a North Carolina city in response to rumors of a white supremacist march. The sheriff had issued a statement that he was investigating the rumors, but no gathering of white supremacists was apparent by midafternoon Friday.

Willis Brown, who is black, said he came out to support racial unity. He said protesters are \"trying to live in harmony .\" ------Noon Four people have been charged with trying to rip away a plaque honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from its place of honor in a North Carolina city.

Strolls down Spanish streets and pedestrian-only areas filled with bars and restaurants are one of the country's biggest tourism draws. Those areas are typically packed with people during the summer, often until midnight or later.

He said: \"On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should like to condemn in the strongest terms the unconscionable terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, which targeted innocent civilians .\" Aboulatta said the Security Council sends its \"deepest condolences\" to the families. Many ambassadors and diplomats stood with their heads bowed in tribute .------4:40 p.m. Barcelona and Real Madrid have held a minute of silence for the victims of the attacks in Spain before their training sessions. Real Madrid players huddled Friday before beginning their activities at the team's training center in Madrid, while Barcelona's squad lined up in silence before its practice session at the team's headquarters. Barcelona team President Josep Bartomeu joined thousands at a minute of silence near where the driver of a van started an attack Thursday that killed at least 13 people and injured more than 100 others in Barcelona. There will be a minute of silence held before every Spanish league game this weekend, beginning with Friday's opening matches: Leganes vs. Alaves and Valencia vs. Las Palmas. Other soccer leagues across Europe have also planned acts to honor the victims of the attacks. The French league will hold a minute of silence before games .------4:30 p.m. Two memorials to the victims have grown on Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas promenade--one at the top near where the van jumped the curb, the other on the Joan Miro mosaic embedded in the pavement where it stopped. An ever-expanding jumble of flags, candles, teddy bears and flowers were placed at the base of the ornate Canaletes Fountain. \"We are not afraid! We are not afraid!\" onlookers chanted in Spanish. Jesus Borrull, a lifelong resident, gently pushed through the crowd to kneel and pray in front of the fountain.
