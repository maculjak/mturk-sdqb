In popular areas along the Yonge subway line, even semi-detached homes are now selling for over $1 million, which is out of reach for most buyers. The reason that prices have risen so fast is that more and more people want to stay in Toronto to raise their families instead of moving to the suburbs. Toronto has become a world class city with great restaurants, unique cultural events, and neighbourhood festivals all over the city. Also, with commute times at a record high, many people who work in the city would rather live close to their work so they don't have to spend hours every day in a car or on a train. So what options are there for people with a budget under $1 million who still want a home in a desirable neighbourhood? I posed this question to former city councillor <mark>Adam Vaughan</mark>, who has long believed that an important part of Toronto's growth as a city includes families living near the downtown core. <mark>Vaughan</mark> cites a regulation for new condos mandating that at least 10 per cent of all units in new buildings have three bedrooms or more. \"10 years ago, people were calling me crazy for pushing this regulation, saying that families would never want to live downtown,\" says <mark>Vaughan</mark>. \"In hindsight, I think we will probably look back and think that the 10 per cent requirement was too low .\" The facts seem to back up <mark>Vaughan</mark>'s statement, as three bedroom condos and townhouses close to the downtown core are now selling faster than ever before. There are schools and daycares opening up in the bottom of large condo buildings, and lots of new parks and playgrounds are being built. Another option that many home owners are not aware of that many newer condo buildings have knockdown walls between units. This means that two or more suites could easily be combined into a larger suite by removing a non-structural mutual wall built in a way that makes it easy to remove. While this is a rare occurrence right now, it is a fascinating example of a policy that allows the market to dictate what type of properties exist in Toronto's downtown core. If families continue to choose to live in the city, then there will be more demand for larger units, and savvy investors will combine two smaller suites into a larger suite to meet demand. It could also be a great investment for buyers to purchase two units side by side and rent one out for several years until their lifestyle requires a larger property. Then they can combine the units together and have a space just as large as a single family home. These options may seem unconventional right now, but if house prices continue to grow anywhere near the current rate, we could see the location of knockdown walls become essential information in every property listing. All of this is good news for home buyers. As the popularity of these larger suites closer to downtown increases, it could make detached homes more affordable, creating more of a balanced market. These changes could be years away, but Toronto is well positioned to offer a variety of options for families wanting to live close to the downtown core.

Last month alone, more than five billion robocalls were made. Lawmakers last week proposed bipartisan legislation to fine scam robocallers up to $10,000 per call; and the FCC is demanding telecommunications companies lay out their plans to meet new standards, so that scam calls can be identified and stopped. CBS News asked major companies what they're doing to stop illegal robocallers and one, T-Mobile, offered to show us. As FCC demands telecom companies to meet new standards, T-Mobile introduces new technologies to screen and block robocalls. CBS NEWS T-Mobile's programs to stop robocalls begin in a lab packed with computer servers. \"This is where we test everything that we put into our network,\" said company vice president Grant Castle. From that noisy room came T-Mobile's Scam ID program. It alerts customers to problem calls they won't want to pick up. \"Although the caller is going to use a phone number close to mine, I'm still going to know it's a scam,\" Castle told correspondent Anna Werner. \"I knew the phone number, I could see it was a scam, so I can send it away .\" Castle believes T-Mobile is ahead of its competitors, and the robocallers. \"Every time we make an improvement, the scammers make a change. So, it's an arms race to see who can trick who,\" he said. And the arms race is escalating: \"The scammers are trying new technologies, new ways to scam people. So, we're upping our technology to keep up with them .\" Customers can use the Scam ID feature to screen unfamiliar calls, or block them completely. And this week, T-Mobile is launching a new app, Name ID, that will allow users to choose the type of call they want to block--everything from nuisance calls, to political or charity calls, even prison calls. \"With this new app, customers have better control over what they would like to see, and what they don't want to see,\" said Castle. But the FCC is also pushing companies to meet new standards known by the acronym SHAKEN/STIR. (SHAKEN = Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs. STIR = Secure Telephone Identity Revisited .) They would allow carriers to verify calls with a digital fingerprint, to show that the person making the call and the person receiving the call are who they say they are, not a scammer trying to \"spoof\" or imitate a phone number. Castle said, \"The standard is essentially, two operators have certificates or tokens that they exchange with each other in each call, and more or less it just says I am who I am .\" T-Mobile says it's ready, and other major carriers say they're working on it. But others apparently are not: in letters the FCC asked them why not, and gave all 14 companies until today to detail their plans to the agency. As FCC chairman <mark>Ajit Pai</mark> told \"CBS This Morning\" in March, \"For those things that are within our authority, we're pursuing them very aggressively .\" But in order for that plan to work, all carriers have to get on board. And industry expert Aaron Foss said, even if that happens, \"scammers are going to go where they can find victims .\" Foss founded Nomorobo, a robocall-blocking app for phones. He says those new SHAKEN/STIR standards are good, up to a point. \"But what it doesn't do is, it doesn't say if that call is legal,\" said Foss. \"It doesn't say anything about the content. It just says that that number is allowed to be called. So, it will stop what is called\" neighbor spoofing,' but it's absolutely not going to solve the whole robocall problem. \"Which is why Foss says Nomorobo takes an\" editorial \"approach to robocalls--blocking them entirely .\" A lot of the other competitors are labeling it or saying things like \"spam likely,'\" scam likely,' \"telemarketer .' We know that consumers just don't want the phone to even ring, and that's what we're doing,\" said Foss. Nomorobo and T-Mobile's Name ID app both have a small monthly fee. CBS News reached out to all 14 phone carriers that received a letter from the FCC. The majority responded and said they will tell the FCC today what they are preparing to do to adopt the new call authentication system in 2019. Whether the carriers will all be able to deploy the system in 2019 remains to be seen. \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc..

The trip was an enormously empowering experience. I have far fewer answers than when I set off but at least now I get the feeling I am equipped to ask better questions. The complexity of the situation we encountered was enormous; sometimes confronting and distressing, at other times uplifting and inspiring yet always somehow confusing and confounding to my white sensibilities.

It was as though they were swimming against a tide of self-destruction. Often these incredible individuals admitted they were merely laying down and smoothing a pillow for a dying generation of broken people. Elsewhere, we visited what most people would have to admit were very efficient, very impressive black communities whose self-governance I would describe as ultra-conservative and zero tolerance. This was hard to take for a bleeding heart leftie like me. These were the sort of no-nonsense, three-strikes-and-you're - out policies that would have most white urban lefties crying \"Fascists!\" if it was implemented by the federal government; yet this was a work of steely self-determination by blackfellas, and it was working just fine. Shit! Maybe I'm not a lefty after all! Advertisement I had believed that under the skin, all humans are alike. I now believe this to be a misconception that sells our wonderful diversity short. I met a man in Arnhem Land who told me that blackfellas and whitefellas are different. Initially I felt uncomfortable with what he was telling me, regarding it as divisive, maybe even racist. He told me that blackfellas and whitefellas see the world differently. That whitefellas generally think in straight lines while blackfellas think in circles. He also said that whitefellas are driven by time while blackfellas are more attached to place.

Photo: <mark>David</mark> Dare Parker I didn't quite get the time and place distinction until it was beautifully Illustrated to me in northern Western Australia. A young Indigenous girl who was working with us told us she was heading to the coast to see her mob .\" How long are you going to be in Wyndham? \"one of us asked her .\" Aw...'til I get back! \", came her thoughtful reply. Pure poetry! We are different. Wonderfully, magically different. I had several confrontations with <mark>David Oldfield</mark>. He was convinced that as a nation, Australia could derive nothing from embracing, supporting or saving Aboriginal culture. He scoffed at programs to save local languages, stating that no young blackfella was going to increase his chances of landing a job because he spoke his own traditional language. Unfortunately, we hear this a lot; there now appears to be only an economy where once there was a society too. Unfortunately, an economy is a cruel task master with a brutal logic and little time for concepts such as, tradition or culture or beauty. <mark>Oldfield</mark> was also often keen to point out that Aboriginal culture was\" stone age \". He used it as a pejorative term, proof that our first nation Australians have little to offer beyond throwing in the towel and assimilating into our technologically advanced, turbocharged, white utopia. I intend to lend <mark>Oldfield</mark> a brilliant book by Bill Gammage entitled The Biggest Estate on Earth. It details how for tens of thousands of years before white settlement, blackfellas conducted incredibly sophisticated land management practices to ensure plentiful wildlife and plant foods. Gammage also contends that without this skilful management, Australia has become vulnerable to the devastating bushfires that we encounter on a regular basis. Australia is selling itself short by marginalising its Indigenous people. We can learn so much from our ancient cultures. So following my time on First Contact, the question I am left with is this: Why do most Australians do not share a pride in our nation's ancient heritage? Surely a deep and respectful knowledge of one's country can only enrich our sense of national identity? I imagined telling the people of my birth place, a nation of proud post-Brexit Britons that we would be wiping all British history pre 1788: No Henry VIII beheading his wives, No Queen Elizabeth I or the Spanish Armada, No 1066 and the Norman invasion. No Romans, no Hadrian's Wall and no Stonehenge! I promise you if this happened there would be blood on the streets Yet this is exactly what we have been asking Australians, both black and white, to accept. I really don't know how we go about closing the shocking gap in equality that I saw between black and white Australia. I fear it may take generations of hard work, belief and understanding before we see real equality. What I do believe is that real healing begins with a desire to see things from the other fella's point of view; a desire for understanding, a need for respect. If we can find a way of developing a deep pride in our shared history, an ancient history, a remarkable story, then this I think will allow us to take the first few steps to really complete us as a nation. Perhaps we white Australians could resist the urge to talk about blackfellas as a costly, and dysfunctional\" them \", and instead start perceiving our first nation Australians as an incredibly proud and integral part of\" us \". We are so keen to pat ourselves on the back for Australia's successful multiculturalism, but Aboriginal history is the fascinating story of multiculturalism writ large. Before 1788 this continent played host to, according to some research, about 450 separate nations all with distinct identities, language, culture and traditions. This is a fabulous story. This is the story of Australia, our country. Black, white, Asian, Pom, it doesn't matter. We should all share a pride in the ancient stories found in the red dust beneath our feet. Only then can we truly call ourselves Australians. Ian\" Dicko' Dickson is a TV and radio presenter. First Contact continues Thursday at 8.30 pm on SBS and NITV.

That's just his mark--the eternal student protester--still holding the same views he held half a century ago. Then, Left-wingers would throng outside the US embassy complaining of US imperialism. Strangely, though, they'd be very quiet about atrocities against citizens in the Soviet Union or communist China. A lot of noise about Vietnam but nothing about the Cultural Revolution in which millions of Chinese were persecuted and thousands executed. <mark>Donald Trump</mark> Piers Morgan interview video: WATCH IN FULL <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s SHOCK reply when asked about Labour's Jeremy Corbyn The Left-wing intellectuals and student activists were wrong then and are wrong now. Hilariously, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry declared yesterday: \"If Mr <mark>Trump</mark> wants to see us, we're more than happy to see him. But we don't think that it's appropriate for him to have a state visit .\" Apparently, Mr <mark>Trump</mark> did decline such an invitation from what he called \"a negative force\" but it makes you wonder at her judgment when senior Labour members were more than happy to line up to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping on his state visit in 2015. Was it possibly because Xi heads a communist state and no matter what crimes a Left-wing tyranny perpetuates, they can never be as bad as the capitalist USA? Chillingly, Chinese state media has censored all references to the student protests in Beijing 30 years ago this week which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead. Just one Chinese media outlet referred to it as a necessary \"immunisation\" against political turmoil. Now that really is something worth protesting about, but we have more fury on the streets of London from fuzzy-headed Lefties against US chlorinated chicken then against human rights violations in China now. Chinese students protest in Tiananmen Square, Peking (Image: Peter Turnley/Corbis/Getty) The full craziness of the Labour view of the world was expressed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan when he insulted the US President by saying: \"He is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat .\" Really? That's more of a danger than a totalitarian nuclear power run by a president for life who is busy interning whole swathes of his population, militarising the South China Sea, rigging world trade and stealing our intellectual property? In contrast, Mr <mark>Trump</mark> is offering us a continued strong alliance and our most important post-Brexit trade deal. I know which I prefer, but maybe Corbyn, Thornberry and Khan know better than me? The visuals say it all. While Leftists rejoiced in floating a baby blimp of <mark>Trump</mark> over London yesterday, in Portsmouth today the US President and Her Majesty the Queen stand side by side to commemorate the launch of the greatest armada for freedom. On that occasion, US and British servicemen sacrificed their lives to defeat a real fascist regime, not the fake \"global far-Right movement\" , supposedly headed by <mark>Trump</mark>, as described by the London Mayor. The ridiculous Emily Thornberry, Lady Nugee (Image: Ian Forsyth/Getty) President <mark>Trump</mark> is simply standing up for sovereign nation states against genuine global threats against our liberty. He is right to stand tall against China's dubious trade practices. He is right to cast suspicion on giving Huawei access to sensitive parts of our communications system. All firms in China come under the shadow of the police state. Fearlessly he stands up against a European Union that bullies its poorer members and does not make a fair contribution to its own defences through Nato. The USA accounts for nearly 70 percent of all Nato expenditure and is entitled to wonder why a rich nation such as Germany doesn't pay more. President <mark>Trump</mark> backs Brexit to the hilt and wishes us well. He has his doubts about entrusting Jeremy Corbyn with joint defence intelligence. It's not surprising when you see Corbyn virtue signalling in Trafalgar Square about diversity, attacking the democratically elected <mark>Trump</mark>, yet being so quiet about human rights abuses in a range of socialist dictatorships from China to Venezuela. I'd rather listen to President <mark>Trump</mark> who said in his speech at the state banquet, recalling the Second World War: \"In that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,\" and made certain this country's destiny remained \"in your own hands\". Thank you, Mr President, and with your continued support, we will ensure it remains that way."}, {"articleID": "2014122805_00021617_W", "names": {"John Harwood": ["Q21165869", "Q6238161", "Q6238165"]}, "date": "2014-12-28", "url": "http://buffalonews.com/opinion/viewpoints/polarized-politics-our-unrealistic-hopes-for-presidents-20141228", "content": "Proposal to dissolve Village of Medina brews dissension Local investment advisers predict a strong year for stocks Welcome federal storm reimbursement will require an accurate accounting New ice rink is turning Canalside into a true year-round destination Another Voice: Old clothing should be donated, not thrown away New ice rink is turning Canalside into a true year-round destination \"Dancing With the Stars\" show is entertaining, but light on substance Mary Anne Buddenhagen, longtime Buffalo News correspondent [BN] the know Subscribe for just $1.99 / wk Polarized politics: Our unrealistic hopes for presidents When will we give up on the idea of a leader who will magically bring consensus and unity to our politics? At election time, candidates seduce us with promises to bring America together, but inevitably fall short and end up leaving office with the country more polarized than when they arrived. After blaming them for their failure to unite us, we turn to the next crop of presidential aspirants and the cycle of hope and disappointment begins all over again. The latest example of this pattern, of course, is President Obama. His 2008 campaign was premised on his ability to forge new coalitions in Washington, which Hillary Rodham Clinton mocked at the time as \"Let's get everybody together, let's get unified, the sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing .\" In office, though, he has never succeeded in overcoming Republican resistance to his agenda, forcing him to pass his most significant legislative accomplishments with few or no GOP votes. After his party's decisive defeat in last month's midterm elections, the administration has now largely given up on the pursuit of bipartisan dealmaking and is pursuing its policy goals on issues like immigration and the environment through executive action. The debate over why Obama failed to achieve some larger consensus has already begun. Some have suggested that if only he had not pursued health care reform or had a less detached and analytical personal style he might have won over the public and his opponents in Congress. It may be true that Obama has made mistakes, but our disappointment with him ultimately reflects the mismatch between our expectations for presidents and the partisan realities of the contemporary era. The public and the news media still want someone who meets the mid-20th-century ideal for a modern president: a uniting figure who works across the aisle to build support for his agenda and commands public opinion from the bully pulpit. While this image was always mostly a myth - presidents typically struggle to move polls or legislators' votes - the political realities of the time did allow presidents to build more diffuse coalitions in Congress and attract broad public support when the circumstances were favorable. However, the political system that helped enable this approach is disappearing. The mid-20th century was a historical anomaly - a low point in polarization that was made possible by the ugly history of race in this country, which enabled the rise of a group of conservative Southern Democrats who functioned almost as a third party. After the civil rights movement, the parties realigned on the issue of race, setting in motion a return to the historic norm of polarization that prevailed in the late 19th and early 20th century. This process, which is transforming all of our nation's political institutions, has been supercharged by the way the parties have become more closely aligned with ideological movements than ever before. A result is what the political scientist Richard Skinner calls the partisan presidency. In this era, presidents are dividers, not uniters (to reverse Bush's famous phrase); their public appeal is deeply polarized along party lines and they depend overwhelmingly on the support of co-partisans in Congress to enact legislation. They are particularly vulnerable to obstruction from the opposition party, which can withhold support as congressional Republicans have done, denying the president the imprimatur of bipartisanship and producing legislative gridlock for which the president is often blamed. That's why it's a mistake to personalize Obama's failures so much, as his critics often do. Critics suggest that Obama is too aloof and hasn't done enough to solicit Republican support or build relationships with legislators. Both may be true, but as <mark>John Harwood</mark> recently noted in the New York Times, Bill Clinton's more successful outreach to his opponents didn't keep him from getting impeached. Likewise, Bush was more gregarious than Obama, but it didn't make him any more popular among Democrats once the post-9 / 11 glow had worn off. It's a common mistake to attribute other people's behavior to their inherent characteristics in this way. We seem especially prone to this pattern, which is known as fundamental attribution error, with presidents. But as recent history shows, our current political system tends to produce division and conflict no matter the circumstances. Comedian Chris Rock is ahead of most political analysts in recognizing this new reality. In a recent interview, he described how Bush adapted to this new political environment, saying Bush \"only served the people who voted for him .\" \"He literally operated like a cable network,\" he added, while Obama is \"a network guy .\" He explained: \"He's trying to get everybody. And I think he's figured out, and maybe a little late, that there's some people he's never going to get .\" As we approach the next presidential campaign, we need to stop asking who can achieve the unity that has eluded Obama. For better or worse, the partisan presidency is here to stay. There are some people the next president will never get, as Rock puts it. The question we should ask instead is whether the candidate we choose will - or can - govern well without their support. Alerts Text message notifications of news happening now.
