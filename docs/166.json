9 billion (rm44 .6 billion) of public money. \"in terms of the olympics, sydney is the benchmark on which london works,\" said british sports minister <mark>hugh robertson</mark>, an interested spectator as lundy spoke under the chandeliers at the australian high commission. \"our legislation is based on sydney and quite a lot of australian companies are involved in the delivery of the london games. we're sort of the oldest rivals and the greatest friends,\" he told reuters. foot in door <mark>john armitt</mark>, who heads the olympic delivery authority that oversaw the building of the london venues, believes the global exposure from the games should be good for british business. \"london is a massive shop window in terms of showing the world what we have been able to achieve here and building on the back of it,\" he said. brazil hosts the soccer world cup in 2014 and olympics in rio de janeiro in 2016. fellow emerging economic power russia stages the 2014 winter games in sochi and 2018 world cup. britain has broken off security cooperation with russia after the 2006 murder in london of kremlin critic <mark>alexander litvinenko</mark>. that limits the ability of its companies to bid for contracts to build stadia for the 2018 world cup where security needs to be addressed before construction can begin. after russia, the world cup will head to wealthy qatar which has plenty of money but little in the way of soccer grounds. <mark>armitt</mark> stressed the value of breaking into such markets when britain is locked in recession and the government is cutting spending on big building projects at home. \"if you look at what is happening in qatar, yes it's building new stadia for the football but alongside it there is just an ongoing very large investment in infrastructure and other sorts of buildings,\" he said. <mark>armitt</mark> cited the example of british builder carillion which was involved in the olympic park in london and recently won a 395 million pounds commercial property development contract in the qatari capital of doha. \"as with all international markets, it's a case of getting your foot in the door on the back of something,\" he said. it was inevitable that contractors would find themselves fighting their own version of the sporting contests that have helped to define britain's relations with \"down under'. guan eng mahu hishamuddin susun semula polis, ramaikan yang perangi jenayah, kurangkan intipan politik karpal singh jadikan pertuduhan hasutan dihadapinya sebagai isu pada pru-13", "articleID": "2012072902_00039684_W", "names": {"John Armitt": ["Q16018043", "Q6219383"]}}, {"date": "2012-08-03", "url": "http://amazinavenue.com/2012/8/3/3216893/this-week-in-mets-quotes", "content": "view full size photo?

i'm not sure there are going to be any innings left at the end of august. so i think it's unlikely we'll see him. <mark>matt harvey</mark> is in a similar situation. he threw, i think, 135 innings last year. we're looking at 165, 170 for him. i'm not saying that's the magic number--just in terms of where we should end up at the end of the season, far short of 200. that may get him through the

lots of attention on facebook and twitter that's how the fans and followers around the web described the weekend's events to nasa's social media team. and while social media users are often portrayed as having short attention spans, the @ marscuriosity twitter account continues to receive about 1,000 new followers an hour since landing on the red planet early monday morning. the facebook page imploded from 30,000 to more than 200,000 fans. \"we were blown out of the water,\" stephanie <mark>l. smith</mark>, social media specialist at nasa, said about the response nasa and the jet propulsion lab's social team received on platforms including twitter, tumblr, reddit, facebook, instagram and google +. the social media strategy was something that was considered years before the landing. nasa-jet propulsion laboratory social media manager veronica mcgregor's first mission with mars was in 2008 when the phoenix rover landed. mcgregor began making plans for curiosity's big day back then. @ marsphoenix was the fifth most followed twitter account in 2008, she said. that account still has more than 200,000 followers. \"we knew there was a big audience out there on twitter,\" mcgregor said. the saturday before the landing, @ marscuriosity had 150,000 followers. it now has more than 818,000 and is growing at a rate of approximately 1,000 per hour, mcgregor estimates. she and two team members, courtney o'connor and <mark>smith</mark>, shape the voices behind many of nasa's social media accounts including @ nasajpl @ marscuriosity and @ asteroidwatch. although exact numbers aren't yet available they were astounded when they discovered their official \"landing tweet\" at 1:32 a.m. est on august 6 was retweeted 70,000 times around the world. a search of links, tweets and images including \"mars\" from saturday to tuesday surpassed 700,000. mcgregor and her team said they believe interest in space has always been high. social media simply allowed the community to find each other, mcgregor says. cnn commenters also responded enthusiastically, sharing the mars landing article to social media more than 26,000 times and leaving more than 4,900 comments. a cnn.com commenter known as explore wrote, \"at the very core of me is a desire to seek the unknown, a desire to look beyond the confines of this tiny little spec in the universe to the vastness that lies beyond. this is inherent to every one of us even though we may sometimes deny it because we can only see the here and now .\" and then there were the unexpected internet wins that the nasa social media team never expected to happen. bobak ferdowsi, a nasa engineer and flight director of the mars science laboratory curiosity mission, was quickly dubbed the \"nasa mohawk guy\" by twitter users who followed his updates at @ tweetsoutloud. internet memes showing a side view of ferdowsi's mohawk with captions including, \"becomes an internet sensation. too busy landing a robot on mars to notice,\" tumblrs about bobak and blog posts exploded across the web. he received several marriage proposals via twitter but probably hasn't seen them. mcgregor says ferdowsi has been on twitter \"a while\" but his account went from several hundred followers on saturday to more than 30,000 tuesday. as curiosity landed ferdowski tweeted, \"so incredible to be a part of this team and all that we've accomplished. impossible not to be an emotional wreck .\" a curiosity rover \"call me maybe\" mashup video surfaced on youtube. caley burke, an aerospace engineer with the kennedy space center created the video after being inspired by the u.s. olympic swim team's version. after closely listening to the lyrics for the first time burke said it made perfect sense. \"i knew we were only going to call if the rover actually landed,\" she said. youtube analytics show the video has been viewed 27,000 times, mostly by males between the ages of 45 and 50. there were viewing parties and thousands crowded into times square in new york city to watch the event unfold, snapping photos and sharing them with mcgregor and her team. it was an event that, judging by social media updates, connected science-loving strangers, restored people's hope in space exploration and elicited a sense of awe. since 2010 nasa has ranked at the top of public sector organizations in effectiveness of social media sites by experts from l2, a think tank for digital innovation. nasa hosted social media followers at seven field centers around the nation on august 3 and live streamed the event online. participants were also given the opportunity to be present when the first signal of the landing was detected by mission control. strategy aside, for some it was simply a moment in time to reflect on the amazing accomplishments of their fellow humans and science. no matter how they arrived, they walked away with much more than just curiosity. . all rights reserved. this material may not be
