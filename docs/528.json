Simon Pagenaud breezed past him high on the restart, triggering a dramatic duel that included five passes in the closing 13 laps. Rossi twice regained the lead, but it was Pagenaud who made the decisive pass, taking the lead heading to the white flag and then holding on through the final lap. It gave Team Penske another win at the Brickyard. And it left Rossi ruing a chance that got away. \"I'm happy to get a result,\" he said, \"but unfortunately nothing else matters here but winning. This one will be hard to get over, but at the end of the day, it's a great showing .\" Rossi said the difference was simple: \"Horsepower .\" All month long, the Chevrolet-powered cars appeared to have an advantage over Honda, particularly when it came to straight-line speed. Honda appeared to have an advantage in fuel mileage, but a late wreck that red-flagged the race wound up making that a moot point. Speed was all that mattered. Pagenaud in his Chevrolet had just a bit more. \"There's not much I can do about that inside the car,\" said Rossi, who won the 2016 race in his first try, and has finished seventh or better in all four starts. \"That last yellow hurt us. We were doing a lot better on fuel mileage than he was. It was the first kind of nail in the proverbial coffin. And the second was I just didn't have the speed out front .\" Rossi acknowledged it was \"a good day for the team,\" but a number of incidents hurt the chances of a car he said was \"by far the best in the field .\" The first came on a pit stop midway through the race, when an issue with a component inside the fueling mechanism caused a problem. While a crew member frantically kept trying to get the gas to flow, Rossi began pounding his steering wheel in frustration for a stop that took more than 20 seconds. It only cost Rossi a handful of spots, thanks to a timely yellow flag. \"It wasn't ideal, for sure,\" said Rossi's race strategist, <mark>Rob Edwards</mark>. The second incident involved Oriol Servia, who was a lap down but found himself jockeying with the leaders with about 50 laps to go. Rossi kept trying to get around him, and at one point got pinched and nearly hit the wall while trying to make a pass, leaving him to ask: \"What is he doing!?\" Rossi finally got around Servia while gesturing wildly from his cockpit at about 230 mph. \"There was a lot of lapped cars and no respect for what we were doing,\" Rossi said. \"It was really unfortunate. Ultimately it didn't make a difference with the result .\" Not with the way Pagenaud was driving down the stretch. He took the lead on Rossi during the restart with 13 laps to go, then gave it up on the next lap, only to regain it once more. Pagenaud patiently waited for the penultimate lap, then swept through Turn 3 to retake the lead as the two of them barreled toward the white flag. Rossi sucked up to his Team Penske rival on the back stretch, but Pagenaud slithered like a snake to keep him behind. Pagenaud then dived low as they exited the final corner, and the break in the draft created enough separation that Rossi was never able to make a finish-line pass. Rossi said that Pagenaud was \"moving in reaction, for sure,\" but he never thought about lodging a protest over the blocking. \"The last lap of the Indy 500,\" he said, \"they're not going to do anything .\" Instead, Rossi tried to turn his anger into a sense of accomplishment. \"This one will be hard to get over, but at the end of the day, it's a great showing,\" he said. \"We have to take the positives from this and the positives are the 27 boys did a phenomenal job .\" ___ More AP auto racing: https: //apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https: //twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

On the first day of his three-day trip to Pakistan, Wang on Sunday inaugurated a number of projects along with Prime Minister <mark>Imran Khan</mark> and the two leaders witnessed signing of several agreements, reports Dawn news. Soon after his arrival at Chaklala airbase, Wang spoke at a meeting of \"Friends of Silk Road\" hosted by the Pakistan-China Institute. Sharing his assessment of the progress on the CPEC and the recently launched second phase, the Chinese Vice President said: \"CPEC has come a long way over the past five years...CPEC is rapidly extending to new priority areas including industrial parks and livelihoods .\" CPEC will produce new outcomes and lend new impetus to economic and social development of Pakistan and economic integration of the region. \"CPEC is a consensus that transcends political parties, regions and communities across Pakistan. It also enjoys the most extensive and strongest support in China .\" Recalling Pakistan's support for China at \"critical moments\" , Wang said Beijing too had always supported Islamabad on its \"core interests\". \"No matter how the international landscape changes, China and Pakistan will always stay iron brothers that trust and support each other,\" he told the gathering. Later on Sunday, President Arif Alvi conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, the highest civil award of the country, on Vice President Wang to recognise his services in promoting Pakistan-China ties.", "articleID": "2019052704_00058321_W", "names": {"Imran Khan": ["Q155164", "Q15987686", "Q1660487", "Q17306146", "Q18351186", "Q18619306", "Q18637473", "Q18637525", "Q18637527", "Q18649030", "Q18687912", "Q18687913", "Q18687915", "Q18687916", "Q21061850", "Q27951129", "Q312781", "Q42560214", "Q43384689", "Q50064378", "Q51161844", "Q57064458", "Q59198528", "Q6008185", "Q6008187"]}}, {"date": "2019-05-27", "url": "https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2019/05/27/1921358/disneys-live-action-aladdin-casts-box-office-spell", "content": "Disney's live-action \"Aladdin' casts a box-office spell (Agence France-Presse) - May 27, 2019 - 7:33 pm HOLLYWOOD--\"Aladdin\" apparently still has the old magic, as the new Disney film took in an estimated $86.1 million in the Friday-to-Sunday period in North America to lead all box-office offerings, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported. The film, released on the US's four-day Memorial Day weekend, is expected to earn $105 million when Monday's ticket sales are included, well beyond earlier estimates of around $80 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The live-action movie, directed by Guy Ritchie, stars <mark>Will Smith</mark> as the genie and the Egyptian-born Canadian actor Mena Massoud as the wily charmer who pretends to be a prince to catch the attention of the lovely Jasmine (Naomi Scott). The new version is an adaptation of Disney's 1992 \"Aladdin,\" which featured the unforgettable voice of <mark>Robin Williams</mark> as the fast-talking genie (and the less well-known actor Scott Weinger as Aladdin). Last week's box-office leader, Lionsgate's \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" slipped to second, taking in $24.4 million for three days ($30.5 million for four). Keanu Reaves again stars as retired hitman John Wick, this time being chased by an army of killers after a contract is put on his head. Also starring are Halle Berry, Laurence Fishburne, <mark>Ian McShane</mark> and Anjelica Huston. In third was Disney blockbuster \"Avengers: Endgame,\" taking in an estimated $16.8 million for three days ($21.9 million for four). \"Avengers,\" with an all-star cast including Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, <mark>Chris Evans</mark>, Chris Hemsworth, <mark>Bradley Cooper</mark>, Scarlett Johansson and Josh Brolin, has broken domestic records but, with a worldwide take of $2.68 billion, is still shy of the $2.79 billion earned by all-time leader \"Avatar\" in 2009. Fourth place went to Warner Bros.' \"Pokemon: Detective Pikachu,\" at $13.3 million ($17 million). Its animated title character (voiced by <mark>Ryan Reynolds</mark>) teams up with a young boy (<mark>Justice Smith</mark>, in a live-action role) to seek the boy's missing father. And in fifth was new Sony horror thriller \"Brightburn,\" at $7.5 million ($9 million). <mark>Elizabeth Banks</mark>, David Denman and Jackson A. Dunn star in the story of an alien tot who arrives on Earth and realizes, as he grows up on a Kansas farm, that he has superpowers. Together with The Walt Disney Company Philippines, SM Cinema opened the streets of Agrabah to mall-goers and movie fans alike with The Magic of Aladdin at the SM City North Edsa. Everyone can get a chance to go around the country in their magical exhibit until May 31 at the SM North EDSA The Block Atrium. Step into the streets of Agrabah when you see the grand entrance arch to the marketplace. Enter the mystery-filled Cave of Wonders and try your hand in getting the Magic Lamp to meet the Genie. Next stop, make your musical entrance to the Streets of Agrabah when you ride Aladdin's camel and take in the sights of the country. Get in the shoes of the Sultan when you snap your photos at the Sultan's Palace. Disney's live-action adaptation of \"Aladdin\" tells the story of Aladdin (Mena Massoud), a kindhearted street urchin, and power-hungry Grand VizierJafar (Marwan Kenzari) as they vie for a magic lamp that has the power to make their deepest wishes come true .--Video from Disney", "articleID": "2019052714_00180198_W", "names": {"Bradley Cooper": ["Q205707", "Q4954898"], "Chris Evans": ["Q17490263", "Q178348", "Q21538587", "Q23418578", "Q27918241", "Q2964709", "Q2964710", "Q303577", "Q466583", "Q5106513", "Q51990270", "Q5392352"], "Elizabeth Banks": ["Q219373", "Q47295776"], "Ian Mcshane": ["Q234141", "Q59149806", "Q5982372"], "Justice Smith": ["Q22058479", "Q6186853"], "Robin Williams": ["Q16853353", "Q27252", "Q28835708", "Q42954305", "Q7352873", "Q7352874", "Q83338"]}}]
