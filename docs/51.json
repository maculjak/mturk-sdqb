eliminating bus and most other school-related traffic - the nws urged motorists to use caution while driving and to be prepared for snow-covered roads and limited visibility. area road conditions began turning snow-covered and slippery thursday afternoon, but road crews were out in full force and only a few non-injury traffic crashes were reported. motorists traveling to dover on s. wooster ave. encountered some noticeable traffic backup and slow driving conditions thursday afternoon, and while weather may have been a factor, the actual cause remains unknown. rick young, dover's general services superintendent, said the backup lasted about two hours, and he believes it was because of unusually heavy northbound traffic from new philadelphia. young surmised that many motorists who normally use the hilly 7 mile dr. (rt. 416) from new philadelphia to rt. 800 might have driven through dover because they believed it would be the safer route. police noted that s. wooster ave. typically during the morning and afternoon rush periods has been carrying an overwhelming amount of traffic since the s. tuscarawas ave. bridge was closed in october. the bridge was removed and is to be replaced by a new bridge within about a year, with traffic diverted to s. wooster ave. during that time. only one crash related to weather conditions was reported in dover. it occurred thursday at 4:55 p.m. when a motorist was driving too fast for road conditions, and her car slid through the s. tuscarawas ave. at harger st. intersection. the car went left of center, crossed the northbound lane into the curb strip and hit a guy wire and a cement barrier. the driver was not injured, and no citations were issued. young said his road crews were out from the time the snowfall began at about 2 until about 10 p.m. he said the crews would return to duty today at 4 a.m. and continue treating the streets as necessary. police in new philadelphia said there were no road related problems because of thursday's weather, and that the snow parking ban for major thoroughfares had not been implemented. mayor <mark>michael taylor</mark> said the snow parking ban wasn't implemented thursday because street crews were able to keep up with snow and ice removal efforts during the storm. \"when they first got out with salt and the plows, the driving lanes went to wet and stayed there,\" he added. the mayor, who is responsible to implement the ban, said thursday night he couldn't predict whether it will be implemented today. \"it's a tool we will try to use if necessary,\" he said. fred neff, new philadelphia's general services superintendent, said the city's salt trucks and snowplows were sent out thursday at about 3 p.m., and some would be out around the clock. however, the city would reduce the number of trucks out from midnight to 5 a.m. then resume its full complement of trucks and drivers in time for the morning commute. neff said thursday's crews hadn't encountered any problems and noted that the city's salt supplies still were adequate. but he said he intends to order more salt today, as \"it looks like this is going to be a winter where we're going to need a bunch .\" tuscarawas county engineer joe bachman said that county salt crews would run their full 17 routes until 7 or 8 p.m. thursday night then the department would reduce its manpower to about four skeleton crews to cover the county through the night until today at 4 a.m. when all crews would return to duty.", "articleID": "2010010804_00077911_W", "names": {"Michael Taylor": ["Q14950779", "Q15052960", "Q15145477",

receive, we regret that we cannot answer or acknowledge all correspondence. dan rodricks jan. 8, 2010 (mcclatchy-tribune regional news delivered by newstex)--in stephanie c. rawlings-blake, baltimoreans get a young, bright and serious new mayor who could bring some urgently needed stability to city government even as she faces one of the toughest fiscal challenges in municipal history. she's the no-drama queen, and that should suit everyone around here just fine. faced with a projected budget shortfall of $127 million or more in the coming fiscal year, the last thing baltimoreans need from city hall is more drama. i interviewed rawlings-blake, along with city councilman <mark>william cole</mark>, on tuesday for my \"midday\" radio show on wypr. i found the city council president conversant in the nuances of the city budget and drawn to the challenge to fix it. she reminded me of her father. until his death in 2003, howard \"pete\" rawlings was one of the most influential and principled legislators in annapolis, a delegate from baltimore who served many years as chairman of the house appropriations committee. he was a master of things fiscal. a math professor, pete rawlings probably understood the state's operating budget better than anyone, and the more vexing the challenges, the more he seemed to thrive. rawlings loved to work the numbers, and he liked to remind his colleagues that keeping maryland's fiscal house in order was their most important duty. pete rawlings would have been proud to hear his daughter talk budget on the radio the other day. on the $127 million shortfall in fiscal 2011, rawlings-blake said: \"it's a very serious prediction. i don't see a lot changing, but we have to stay focused on having diverse revenue streams for the city. we can't just depend on property taxes. we certainly can't depend on income tax when people are losing jobs, when people's salaries are being decreased. we have to look at diversifying our revenue and being smarter about our spending. we have to focus on our priorities, get rid of any frivolous spending and do what families are doing all over this city--do more with less .\" you know, \"she said,\" we're going to weather this storm, and when we get on the other side of it, we need to know that we're not losing ground in public safety and public education. \"i asked about the city's current policy of rotating firehouse closures as a way to save money .\" i have a lot of respect for chief [jim] clack because he was one of the only administration leaders who came into the budget hearing and was brutally honest about the impact the reduced budget would have on his department, \"she said .\" a lot of people want to paint a rosy picture and say, \"ok, cut my budget and it won't affect anything .' he was very clear--you cut my budget and this is what will happen. and the rotating closures, he made it clear, was making the best out of a bad situation .\" callers to the radio show offered ideas to fix baltimore's money problems. have an amnesty period for people who owe parking fines, said a man from ellicott city. \"a few years ago i had the same idea and was given a very interesting lesson by the finance department,\" rawlings-blake said. \"when we took a look at the money that comes in for an amnesty and the revenues lost, it's really not a great thing for the city. if people think every three years there's going to be amnesty, that affects behavior--people don't pay, they wait for the amnesty .\" another \"midday\" listener suggested that the city increase home ownership by renovating some of the thousands of vacant rowhouses here. rawlings-blake acknowledged that as a good idea but then added her own take, pushing for slot machine revenue--pete rawlings was a longtime advocate of legalizing slots--and finishing with the kind of upbeat, cheerleader-like flourish baltimoreans like in their mayors: \"there are other ways to increase home ownership. one of the things we're all hoping for is moving forward with slots, to get the revenue and start to bring down the property tax rate. if we can make our property tax more competitive, people will realize the possibilities for baltimore ....we're starting to see people from the surrounding jurisdictions come for our charter schools, come for our transformation schools, come for our top high schools. people want to be here, but they're facing these impediments, and if we can start to bring that property tax down, we'd turn it around and fill some of these vacant homes and build our tax base as well .\" for a lot of baltimoreans, the first and lasting impression of stephanie rawlings-blake was that of pete's daughter, the 24-year-old political novice and the youngest person ever elected to the city council.", "articleID": "2010010812_00035121_W", "names": {"William Cole": ["Q18922393", "Q21464490", "Q21464495", "Q8006976"]}}, {"date": "2010-01-11", "url":

witnessed a murder; davis, however, managed to convince people that jimmy was hallucinating. soon after, chloe and clark kryptonite cage, but it failed and he adapted. so he turned to chloe for help, since being near her suppressed doomsday inside of him. with clark in the fortress, davis went on the run with chloe, vowing never to never look back. the justice league located and captured both chloe and davis with the intention of killing davis in order to protect clark. when davis began transforming into doomsday, chloe used davis begins transforming into doomsday. davis was medium-sized (around 6') with short brown hair and brown eyes. he was often seen wearing his paramedic uniform while working at metropolis general hospital. when off-duty, he usually wore casual dark clothing that was mainly black, dark blue, grey, dark brown and green. according to his biological mother faora, davis was the spitting image of his biological father zod, before he became a phantom wraith. davis' monstrous form as doomsday isn't human-looking at all, and is representative of all the kryptonian creatures fused within his dna. when doomsday was seen transforming back into davis, a bone along the line above his eyebrows was seen growing back into his head before he woke up screaming. witnesses who survived the attack at the ace of clubs described the person responsible as a creature with some kind of bony eyelids. when transformed, doomsday is covered in black spikes and bony protrusions, and is much taller and bulkier than his human form. he has big glaring red eyes, with harder, brighter bones across his eyes and down his nose. his skin is also denser and a dark grey color that makes him look more menacing coupled together with black spikes growing out of every part of his body.

of a perpetual outsider. beneath davis' charismatic, easygoing demeanor laid a brooding sense of isolation and insecurity. he was, however, caring and often willing to offer his services to his friends or put his job on the line, such as treating poisoned. however, when transformed (a condition he couldn't control), davis' true personality was utterly ruthless, injuring or killing anyone who stood in his way; a prime example of this is when brainiac lured doomsday into kidnapping chloe, he destroyed clark's barn and injured many people, including jimmy. davis was horrified by the fact that his alter-ego was so violent and destructive, going so far as to take anti-psychotic pills in order to control his transformations; however, his adaptive abilities eventually made him immune to the effect of the pills. while transforming into doomsday, davis tried to warn chloe (and clark, through her) of his alter-ego. as a result of clark's resetting of time, however, davis was the one who was targeted by linda lake instead of clark. at the hospital, linda stated that she knew davis' secret and began agitating him with the intention of getting doomsday to release her; davis'
