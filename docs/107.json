was the act that dead-weighted her prime ministership, and almost cost Labor power federally in 2010 - but <mark>Julia Gillard</mark> says she would not reverse the decision to depose Kevin Rudd as Labor leader and prime minister. In an interview with the Nine Network broadcast on Tuesday evening, <mark>Gillard</mark> did not resile from the June 2010 leadership coup \"even with the benefit of hindsight\" - even though most senior Labor figures now do, regarding the strike against Rudd as a fundamental mistake. In characteristically unflinching fashion, <mark>Gillard</mark> told interviewer <mark>Ray Martin</mark>: \"Still, even with the benefit of hindsight, [I] don't see an alternative to what I did that day.\" <mark>Gillard</mark> also declared she would have \"out-campaigned <mark>Abbott</mark>\" if the Rudd forces had not destabilised her and run her down before the 2013 federal poll. \"If I'd had a clear run...I would have out-campaigned <mark>Abbott</mark>. I would have run a better campaign and I could have landed us in the same spot. That's my view, others will contest it, I get that.\" The conversation with <mark>Martin</mark> broadcast on Tuesday night is part of a promotional drive for <mark>Gillard</mark>'s memoir, My Story, to be released on Wednesday. <mark>Martin</mark> noted during the interview the memoir is a tale of \"almost unbridled treachery\" - a reference to her poisonous relationship with Kevin Rudd, which is canvassed extensively in the book. Despite being unable to countenance a viable alternative to deposing Rudd, <mark>Gillard</mark> is not without regret about the events of 2010. She regrets that she \"fed hope\" to Rudd in their fraught conversation over whether there were any circumstances in which he could hold on to the Labor leadership after their confrontation in June. She acknowledges that the act of blasting Rudd out of the prime ministership was traumatic for him and consequential for her. It assigned her a reputation for \"political brutality\" - \"the woman who wielded the knife\" - a difficult bequest given that in the critical moment of decision, she'd actually been \"hesitant.\" She told <mark>Martin</mark> the voters were surprised and disconcerted by the abrupt leadership change because she and other Labor players had shielded them from the government's policy drift and descent into internal paralysis. <mark>Gillard</mark> suggests she thought Rudd would move on and more than likely quit politics, \"free from the weight...because he'd found it so difficult in those last few months. Obviously I was wrong about that.\" \"If you look at my prime ministership there was this sort of cocktail, the internal destabilisation, the minority government - I think a harshness in the public critique - all of that swirled together to make it very hard political yards,\" she said. <mark>Gillard</mark> said her prime ministership felt like a fight on two fronts. \"You had this parallel tracks between what the opposition was saying about me and what the, you know, internal critics were saying about me - and that was a very hurtful, powerful dynamic.\" <mark>Gillard</mark> says she promised Rudd the foreign affairs portfolio after the loss of the leadership in a transaction designed to \"stop the leaks.\" Tuesday night's interview with <mark>Martin</mark> covered a range of topics. <mark>Gillard</mark> accepts complete responsibility for the \"real <mark>Julia</mark>\" botch up in the 2010 campaign. The newly minted Labor leader used a newspaper interview to attempt to reset a campaign plagued by leaks and missteps and excessive stage management by insisting she would, henceforth, be \"the real <mark>Julia</mark>\" - a declaration which served to reinforce voter's doubts about her authenticity. \"I put my hand up for that, one hundred percent...a dumb rookie error.\" <mark>Gillard</mark> is highly critical of press gallery journalists. She says some \"became activists in the leadership contest...(and) that's not their job as journalists.\" She also used the conversation with <mark>Martin</mark> to deliver a hard flick at radio talkback host <mark>Alan Jones</mark> - the broadcaster who declared <mark>Gillard</mark>'s father had \"died of shame.\" <mark>Gillard</mark> says <mark>Jones</mark> delivered only a \"mealy mouthed apology\" for the infelicitous outburst, and he only delivered that because of commercial pressure. \"It was a disgraceful thing; unforgiveable.\" She says she felt \"sorry\" for Germaine Greer - who made a famous crack about <mark>Gillard</mark>'s \"big arse\" . From \"being the feminist for our times, to end up talking like that for cheap laughs about another woman was a really sad thing\" . There are reflections on her time in the Lodge, the famous misogyny speech, her relationship with partner Tim and their daily routine, her atheism, her personal rapport with US president Barack Obama, the pressures of appearance and fashion for female leaders - and reflections on <mark>Tony Abbott</mark>. She says <mark>Abbott</mark> lacked the application required to persuade the cross bench independents to form a minority government after the 2010 election. \"I turned up, I was there every day doing it personally. <mark>Tony</mark> took a different approach.\" She contends that in the prime ministership, <mark>Abbott</mark> is a \"slave\" to the whims of <mark>Clive Palmer</mark>. \"On the big questions where the major parties have divided Mr <mark>Abbott</mark> can't do anything unless <mark>Clive Palmer</mark> says yes.\" On gay marriage -

an unnatural amino acid. these amino acids are chemically distinct from the 20 amino acids that naturally exist in the body; they can be engineered for different desirable properties, such as to fluoresce.\" once you have a stem cell line stably incorporating uaas, you can custom the uaa to study stem cell biology, \"<mark>wang</mark> says.\" you also get the bonus of obtaining various mature cells with this ability through differentiation, such as neurons, which are difficult to insert uaas in and expensive to procure in large amounts. \"in the first set of experiments, the researchers found out that uaas were successfully incorporated into neural stem cells, the incorporation lasted through the differentiation, and these cells then produced neurons carrying the fluorescent amino acid. the second set of experiments was to demonstrate how these uaas can be used to help solve a biological question. the researchers wanted to know how voltage-sensitive ion channels, which are pore forming proteins, work in neurons. in these nerve cells, membrane ion channels respond to changes in electric current - the charged signal that is passed between neurons - that either activate or silence the neurons.\" we are trying to understand how the electric field of cell membranes can turn on or turn off protein activities - like a switch in a house turns on or off lights, \"<mark>wang</mark> says. to study this phenomenon, the researchers embedded a fluorescent uaa into a protein domain that ion channel and other proteins used to sense the electric field in neural stem cells, which produced neurons with the same embedded uaa. they could then watch, in real time, the fluorescent tag given changes in electrical current across the neuron.\" we detected changes in fluorescence intensity of the uaa when the neurons were stimulated, and these changes are dependent on where the uaa was incorporated, which hint that different positions of the protein are moving into or outside of the membrane in response to the electric field. \"<mark>wang</mark> says this experiment, designed to demonstrate the power of uaas in brain cells, can also be adapted to study other membrane proteins in other cells, no matter where they exist in the body. source: salk institute"}, {"articleID": "2011123107_00060246_W", "names": {"Bob Clark": ["Q2413649", "Q4932080", "Q50983316", "Q5389944"]}, "date": "2011-12-31", "url": "http://registerguard.com/web/sports/27393145-41/ppg-washington-game-rpg-huskies.html.csp", "content": "contain tony wroten and duck men's basketball just might ruin dawgs' day <mark>bob clark</mark> the register-guard (friday, dec 30, 2011 11:18 pm) today seattle - all oregon needs to worry about tonight is avoiding turnovers, keeping washington at bay on the boards, dealing with the usual frenetic pace of the huskies and, oh, yeah, defending the pac-12's best freshman. in other words, it's a lot of the usual problems when going against washington, with the presence of tony wroten added in. \"he's an awfully good player,\" uo coach dana altman said of the uw freshman. \"he's very athletic and has good instincts .? he scores a lot of baskets.\" the 6-foot-5 wroten scored 26 points, led the huskies with nine rebounds and had four assists in washington's 95-80 win over oregon state on thursday. after entering the game with the most turnovers in the pac-12, he committed only two in 32 minutes as his game settled down. though he has started only the past four games, wroten has scored at least 23 points in three of them, raising his season average to 16.8 points. that ranks him atop the pac-12 among all players, and fifth in the nation among freshmen. certainly there are other issues for the ducks (10-3, 1-0) as they attempt to open the pac-12 schedule with a sweep after thursday's 92-75 win over washington state. there is, for instance, the fact the huskies (7-5, 1-0) lead the pac-12 in offensive rebounds, with 14.2 per game. who wants to give this team that many extra chances at scoring? the huskies do that anyway by forcing about 14 turnovers by opponents. oregon had a solid rebounding game against wsu with a positive margin of 12 in rebounds, but even there, the ducks had 17 turnovers. and the cougars aren't the match for the huskies in putting pressure on ballhandlers. \"we don't want to give up easy baskets because they're going to score enough as it is,\" altman said. \"we've got to handle the ball and not turn it over? (and) stay with them on the boards.\" oregon isn't about to suddenly turn into a team that runs a slowdown offense, but altman would prefer the game not be played at the huskies' pace. too many teams can get drawn into playing out of control by washington, and then find themselves playing catch-up. \"i don't think it'll be a low-scoring game but i don't think we want it in the 90s,\" altman said. washington's task will be to force its favored tempo on oregon. as he previewed the game friday afternoon, uw coach lorenzo romar spoke of the \"efficiency\" with which the ducks ran their offense in the win over wsu, leading to oregon's shooting a season-high .694 percentage from the field. \"they've got a lot of experience on that team and they played like that on the road,\" romar said. \"you can't fall asleep (defensively)? when you make a mistake, mark it in your book, they're going to score.\" uo sophomore guard johnathan loyd has a sore thigh after taking a knee to that area in thursday's game. \"he's hobbling around a little bit, but i think he's ok,\" altman said. back to form use the below form to e-mail this story to your friends. notice: you must have javascript enabled to use this form. attention: * indicates a required field. contain tony wroten and duck men's basketball just might ruin dawgs' day | a lucky survivor | a eugene man feels fortunate for his timely heart treatment every time 61-year-old charles mestrich jr. hears about another young athlete who suddenly collapsed and died, and the autopsy reveals hypertrophic cardio?

A look at the destruction and what we know about it. Thousands of people in Southern California were forced to evacuate on Tuesday as wind-whipped wildfires continued to blaze across Ventura County. Officials said that the so-called \"Thomas Fire,\" which started Monday about 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has caused 27,000 people to evacuate, destroyed at least 150 structures and has scorched roughly 65,000 acres so far. At least 12,000 additional structures are threatened by the wildfire as well. The cause of the fire is currently unknown. No fatalities have been confirmed yet, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said Tuesday. One unnamed firefighter has reportedly been injured and three others were burned, the Los Angeles Times reported. President Trump tweeted about the wildfires on Wednesday, writing: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California's wildfires. I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!\" Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California's wildfires.

Trump (@ realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2017 In light of the Thomas Fire, here's what you need to know about California wildfires. How do the fires start? Roughly 95 percent of wildfires are caused by humans, <mark>Scott McLean</mark>, an information officer at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, told Fox News. A simple task--like mowing the lawn, throwing a cigarette butt out of a window, or parking a car on dry grass--can spark a fire, he said. For instance, if a rock hits the lawn mower's metal blades, that's usually enough friction to create a spark that can ultimately start a fire, he said. And the heat from a car's catalytic converter, a device that's located underneath that controls its exhaust emissions, can reach up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit--enough heat to create a fire if the car is parked over dry, flammable grass. \"It only takes one spark to start a fire,\" he said. How are wildfires stopped? Officials are currently unsure what sparked the wildfires in Southern California. (The Associated Press) All wildfires can bring mass destruction. But the way each fire is stopped varies, <mark>McLean</mark> said. In other words, \"the different vegetation and different scenarios up and down the state\" impact how each fire is handled. \"You don't just throw resources at a wildfire,\" he said. \"It's like a battle--you have to think what will be the most effective.\" Cal Fire usually depends on a mix of bulldozers, fire engines, inmate crews, and helicopters or airplanes, which disperse things like fire retardant, to stop wildfires. Using containment lines, or large areas where a bulldozer cuts away vegetation to the point where only dirt remains, is very common, he said. But this isn't always an accessible option. \"\"What would increase the fire's speed, what would slow it down?,'\" he asked. \"Helicopter and airplanes are ineffective with winds over 30 miles an hour, and bulldozers can't always get in there.\" Strong wind gusts also cause problems when putting out or controlling wildfires, he said. Regional atmospheric patterns that develop in the fall create dry, hot wind gusts that can sometimes reach 80 miles per hour. These winds can create so-called \"spot fires\" --which is when an ember from the main wildfire gets blown into a nearby bush or field, ultimately creating a second fire. \"It's like a blowtorch.\" - <mark>Scott McLean</mark> \"It's like a blowtorch,\" he said. Rain is typically welcome, as it can slow down or deter the fire, he said. But it can also create muddy conditions for bulldozers and fire crews which impacts how they can combat the blaze. As for the Thomas Fire, however, <mark>McLean</mark> said resident safety comes first--hence the evacuation that took place on Tuesday. He added that Cal Fire is expecting more resources to come to the Ventura County area, adding that \"several strategies and tactics are in place\" to stop or control it. \"It's a case by case basis, and it's extremely fluid,\" he said. Why have California's wildfires been so destructive recently? <mark>McLean</mark> explained that California has faced a significant drought over the past five years, which created a lot of dead vegetation across the state. Like other mediterranean climates, winter time brings rain, which fills up water reserves and helps new vegetation to grow. California also had a record amount of rainfall in spring of 2017. But the summer's heat dried out that new growth, and, combined with the autumn winds, means \"a lot of fuel was created for wildfires,\" he said. The Santa Ana winds are currently pushing the Thomas Fire. <mark>McLean</mark> said there are 102 million or more dead trees in California--all potential fuel for wildfires to blaze across the state. \"There's a long road ahead of us. The fires we've dealt with recently--like the Thomas Fire--are all indicators of what we're having to deal with in California for the next few years,\" he said, adding that many of these fires have been wind-driven. \"Rains are not a cure all with one winter--it will take several years of winters to get moisture back into plants and reservoirs.\" Additionally, unlike tornados and hurricanes, wildfires don't really have a season, <mark>McLean</mark> said. At this point, \"there's pretty much no fire season. It's year round,\" he said. An impact on wine and entertainment Wildfires could also impact the state's wine industry from an economic standpoint, wine experts previously told Fox News. The California wine industry generates $57.6 billion in annual economic activity in the state and $114 billion in the country, according to statistics from the Wine Institute, a California-based public policy organization. The wine industry can be affected by wildfires in California. (The Associated Press) About 325,000 Californians are employed by the wine industry in California. The industry also contributes $17.2 billion in wages annually in the state. Additionally, it generates $7.2 billion in tourism expenditures in California. What's more, the Hollywood Reporter reported Tuesday that HBO suspended its second season of \"Westworld\" due to a 200-acre brush fire that broke out near where the show was filming.

Credit <mark>Bryan Thomas</mark> for The New York Times The Windows era at Microsoft, long in eclipse, is officially history. Microsoft said on Tuesday that it was splitting up its Windows engineering team and that the leader of its Windows business was leaving. The moves, analysts said, were part of a reorganization intended to accelerate Microsoft's emphasis on newer, faster-growing businesses like cloud computing and data-fueled artificial intelligence. That shift, they noted, has been underway since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014. In an email to employees, Mr. Nadella cited the central role of cloud computing and the advances in artificial intelligence--and their potential across all the company's products. The organizational overhaul, Mr. Nadella wrote, \"enables us to step up to this opportunity.\" Terry Myerson, 45, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and devices group, will be departing. In a separate email to employees, Mr. Myerson said that he supported the company's evolution under Mr. Nadella. \"I believe in it, and these changes are great for Microsoft,\" wrote Mr. Myerson, who worked for the company for 21 years.

Windows technology, analysts said, will increasingly be folded into Microsoft's cloud software. Other engineers will create the user applications--\"Windows experiences,\" in Microsoft terms--that ride on top of the underlying software, in smartphones, tablets, personal computers and game consoles.

Credit Eric Risberg/Associated Press Today, cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft and Google have become the internet equivalent of Windows, the dominant operating system of the personal computer era. Software developers write new applications to run on the cloud services, just as they once did for the Windows operating system. Microsoft has successfully rewritten its popular Office productivity products as web-based applications running on the cloud. The reorganization is \"really doubling down on the cloud as the fundamental platform for Microsoft,\" said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner.

In the most recent quarter, its Azure business grew 98 percent and its cloud-based Office 365 offering by 41 percent. By contrast, the division that includes the Windows PC software increased 2 percent. The formal relegation of the Windows franchise, said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, \"has been a long time coming.\" And such a transition, Mr. Cusumano said, \"probably had to be done by a second or third generation of leader.\" Mr. Nadella succeeded Steven A. Ballmer, the longtime ally and friend of Microsoft's co-founder, Bill Gates. Beyond the organizational changes, Mr. Nadella said in his email that Microsoft's research leader, <mark>Harry Shum</mark>, and president, <mark>Brad Smith</mark>, have established a panel, the A.I. and Ethics in Engineering and Research Committee, to increase the odds that A.I. technology \"benefits the broader society.\" That move, said Patrick Moorhead, an independent analyst, is Microsoft's effort to show it is \"serious about the broader implications of A.I.\" at a time of rising concern about the technology's influence on people's behavior and as a threat to jobs.
