(two republican senators have also introduced a (credit: npr) less than ten percent of npr's budget comes from federal funding. (hotsheet took a detailed look at npr funding here; npr does not take a direct allocation from cpb, but it gets taxpayer money through member-station dues as well as grants .) republicans argue that npr \"would be fine\" without federal money, in the words of sen. jim demint (r-s.c.), who says that \"forcing taxpayers to give public broadcasting hundreds of millions of dollars makes little sense when we're facing a $14 trillion debt and there are already thousands of educational and entertainment choices in the media .\" (one side note here: the majority of npr funding comes from tax-deductible donations from individuals and corporations, so even without the cpb funding, taxpayers would still--indirectly--be subsidizing npr .) cpb says that $96.2 million from its fiscal year 2011 allocation is going to public radio, with the majority of that going to local stations and projects, not npr itself. ($288.5 million of the cpb allocation is directed to public television; the rest goes to cpb operations and support .) while npr could likely survive without the federal subsidy, npr says many of its local member stations would not, something schiller noted in his secretly-recorded comments. supporters of npr argue that public radio is a valuable source of quality news that many americans - particularly in rural areas - would lose access to if their member station were to close. \"every month, more than 170 million americans turn to their local public broadcasting stations for free, high-quality programs that focus on the issues most important to them - what's happening in their community,\" congressman earl blumenauer (or-03), founder and co-chairman of the bipartisan congressional public broadcasting caucus, said in a wednesday statement. he added that 21,000 public broadcasting jobs across the country would be at risk without the subsidy. \"as traditional news outlets lay off reporters and offer less coverage of important topics, public broadcasting is filling the gap, bringing critical news and information to communities across the country,\" blumenauer added. \"what's more, public broadcasting stations are the only source of free programming that educates our children rather than the many commercial stations simply trying to sell them products. our communities, our workers and our children would be the true victims of any cuts to funding for public broadcasting .\" (at left, sen. bernie sanders of vermont argues in favor of taxpayer funding for public broadcasting .) for opponents, this argument is absurd; the market, they say, provides the programming that people want. and besides, they argue, npr is not simply a news outlet but rather a purveyor of a liberal agenda - a perception heightened by schiller's criticism of the tea party movement as \"racist\" and comment that \"liberals today might be more educated, fair and balanced than conservatives .\" (schiller was an npr fundraiser who did not have an editorial role at the network .) eric deggans, the media critic for the st. petersburg times who also contributes to npr, said in an interview that he believes npr makes a concerted effort to be fair in its news coverage. (deggans stressed that his connection to the network made him less than impartial .) \"when it comes to their opinion shows and their commentary shows and stuff like that, they're focused on kind of a college educated audience,\" he said. \"and they have a very tight focus on who their listenership is, and they're creating shows that speak to those people. i think sometimes people see that focus and they translate that into a liberal bias .\" ombudsman reported that 50 percent of the npr audience sees the network's coverage as balanced, while roughly 40 percent sees the network as liberal and four percent see it as conservative. according to independent data, it was more likely to be seen as fair in its coverage than pbs, abc, nbc, cbs, cnn, fox news channel and msnbc. (as for the npr audience: according to mediamark research, 37 percent identify as liberal, 28 percent identify as conservative, and 25 percent identify as middle of the road .) in an interview, <mark>jay rosen</mark>, who teaches journalism at new york university and runs the blog pressthink, stressed the ideological balance of the npr audience. he also said attacks on npr grounded in charges of bias were more about the culture war than reality. \"it's impossible to determine [bias], because bias is itself a category subject to bias,\" he said. \"and i don't know the way out of that loop, i don't think anyone does. so bias is a club that people use to beat the news media with, and it has been wielded very successfully in this case .\" conservative commentator and media figure andrew breitbart said the debate over npr's bias is \"long over,\" though he said \"npr is my favorite of the biased media news organs .\" (asked why, he added: \"i like a lot of the local news programming, and there's something pleasant about the whispery, willowy news delivery .\" ) \"i think a lot of their in depth stuff is very, very interesting, but it's important to understand that you're getting liberals and leftists presenting the news in as unbiased way as they possibly can, and it's still exceptionally biased though that machinery,\" he said. breitbart, an ally of <mark>o'keefe</mark>, boiled down the debate over npr's funding this way: \"those on the left want it publicly funded because it comports with their worldview. those on the right because it doesn't comport with their worldview .\" (credit: michael benabib, ap photo/npr) white house press secretary jay carney on wednesday said the obama administration opposes efforts to eliminate public funding for public broadcasting - though he declined to spell out exactly why the funding was necessary. that prompted republican national committee spokesperson kirsten kukowski to argue that \"the fact that the white house can't defend but insists on showering hundreds of millions of dollars on npr in the midst of a fiscal crisis shows this administration has zero credibility on addressing their addiction to spending .\" decision to accept the resignation of ceo vivian schiller (no relation to ron schiller), which was criticized by many on the left, was designed to bolster npr's chances of hanging onto its federal subsidy. (schiller, who was widely criticized by conservatives for her handling of the firing of commentator and fox news contributor juan williams, said in an interview with the associated press wednesday that her continued presence in the wake of the ron schiller incident complicated the network's efforts to maintain the subsidy .) but the resignation was not enough for brent bozell, president of the conservative media group the media research center, who argues that \"npr hates middle america .\" \"the resignation of vivian schiller doesn't change a thing about npr,\" bozell said in a letter to members of congress wednesday. \"...a government that is broke should not be in the business of funding a left-wing playground .\" in a statement released wednesday afternoon, cpb said \"public broadcasting educates our children, increases our sense of community as americans, and provides a respectful non-commercial alternative on a hyper-commercial media landscape .\" trump takes credit for obama birth certificate release, but wonders \"is it real?\" by moretruthnow march 12, 2011 1:30 am est by moretruthnow march 12, 2011 1:30 am est with 100s of tv and radio stations, the american taxpayer should not be forced to fund one. we have very hard choices to make on federal spending. this is not one of those. politicians don't want to be the ones in office to make those choices, that is why many of them say they will not run again. they know what has to be done in order to save this nation - they are just to gutless to handle it on their watch. they want to push this off on the next guy. we have to make very hard choices in a lot areas that no one wants to have to make - we will have to make huge reductions in the size and scope of the federal government. let's put this in perspective: a 2005 washington post article stated that had a \"$318.62 billion deficit\" for the 2004 year. this was for the entire year!!!!!! today, the idiots in washington are over spending at the rate of $222.5 billion in a month!!!!!! this is totally insane. the cbo stated that this deficit spending is \"unsustainable\". what does washington not understand about the word \"unsustainable\" ?????? washington is out of control. and some people wonder what some americans mean by the term \"take our country back\" ??? we have to take this nation out of the hands of irresponsible fools, who are running this once great nation into the ground. to some degree we will have to wait for 2012. however, the need is now. call and write your representative and give him/her an ear full! washington is drunk on spending away our future. maybe millions of phone calls and emails will wake them up a little. by gosstom march 11, 2011 2:51 am est by redkcir-2009 march 11, 2011 12:44 am est march 11, 2011 1:40 am est it's here for me. it's here for you,...by ongelooflijk-2009 march 10, 2011 10:44 pm est npr and pbs: unbiased news, commentary and public interest programming at its finest i've been a fan of npr and pbs for over thirty years and they are about as unbiased as they come. the reason you neocons hate them so much is that they don't push your brand, or any brand for that matter---- - because they are national public radio and the public broadcasting system (emphasis on public) for obvious ethical reasons they can't and won't--while going above and beyond to insure unbiased coverage! in addition, they don't play to advertisers or the ratings which i think is admirable. as regards ron schiller, he's certainly entitled to his private opinions, yet in his capacity as a fundraiser and while on the stump for npr he ought to have used more discretion. the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. by using this web site you agree to accept our report offensive content: if you believe this comment is offensive or violates the cbsnews.com terms of use, you can report it below (this will not automatically remove the comment). once reported, our staff will be notified and the comment will be reviewed. offensive: sexually explicit or offensive language advertisements, commercial links, or repetitive posts disruptive posting: flaming or offending other users illegal activities: promote cracked software, or other illegal content e-mail this comment to a friend. e-mail this to: send me a copy of this message note: your e-mail address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail and in case of transmission error. neither your address nor the recipients's address will be used for any other purpose. royal wedding rehearsal miliatry troops rehearse their roles in friday's royal wedding a glimpse at the days news as seen through a camera's lens britain's ministry of defense releases a few never-before-seen photos of the prince's time with the royal navy in 2008 even little changes can bring big improvements in productivity and mental focus 60 minutes ipad app watch segments on demand, browse archives, & get the story behind the story.", "articleID": "2011042716_00071191_W", "names": {"James O'Keefe": ["Q6140497", "Q6140500"], "Jay Rosen": ["Q1378510", "Q554143"]}}, {"date": "2011-04-28", "url": "http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2011/04/28/suck-at-production-this-event-is-for-you-knucklehead", "content": "music listings in the film section: line out music & the city at night suck at production?

been no known specific or credible threats received since american troops killed osama bin laden this week, but on tuesday security at public spaces - including mosques, synagogues, train stations and basketball arenas - remained at elevated levels. police officers on tuesday monitored los angeles international airport, one of a number of sites where security was increased. although the department of homeland security has not issued an alert, the agency remains at what the homeland security secretary, janet napolitano, has called a \"heightened state of vigilance .\" the state department, on the other hand, has issued a worldwide travel alert to americans. in philadelphia, the police commissioner, charles h. ramsey, has placed the department on \"high alert,\" increased patrols around religious buildings, and intensified security at tourist attractions and shopping malls, the police said. \"we haven't added more personnel; we're just doing more checks and asking our officers and citizens to be more aware,\" said lt. ray evers, a police spokesman. the additional security includes hourly checks at some of the city's synagogues and mosques, as well as arranging meetings with building superintendents and representatives of large businesses and manufacturers to remind them to report suspicious activity to the police, lieutenant evers said. in phoenix, officials said they had supplemented security at the city's airport, municipal buildings and houses of worship and on its light rail system, said scott krushak, the coordinator for phoenix's office of emergency management. \"we're not doing it because we've had any threats, but because it is part of a\" lean forward' strategy we have here in the city of phoenix, \"mr. krushak said .\" we are really relying on the community to tell us if they see anything. \"in los angeles, the police sent additional officers to the staples center for the lakers playoff basketball game against dallas on monday, and officials said they intended to also supplement police patrols at dodger stadium. even before the death of bin laden, security at dodgers games had been stepped up after a fan of the rival san francisco giants was badly beaten in a stadium parking lot last month. in addition, lt. andy neiman, a police spokesman, said the police were paying particular attention to airports, ports and telecommunications hubs. at los angeles international airport on tuesday, debby cummings, 44, who was on a flight from detroit to visit friends in los angeles, said the security screening in detroit seemed normal except that more passengers had been told to go through full-body scanners. ms. cummings said that she had not been overly concerned about flying, but that her 15-year-old son had worried the plane might explode .\" in detroit they had two of the body scanners, which they were sending most people through, but other than that it was the same, \"she said .\" they only had one scanner before, and they didn't used to make the majority of people go through it. \"in chicago, the police department said it had sent additional officers to patrol around houses of worship, the richard j. daley center, and at the united center, where arena security personnel checked fans arriving to monday night's basketball game against atlanta with handheld metal detectors. similar procedures were to be in place for an n.b.a. playoff game in oklahoma city on tuesday night and for all remaining basketball playoff games, officials said. in miami, the police have added officers with dogs at miami international airport, but many airports around the country, including those in san francisco and seattle, said they had taken no additional security precautions because the federal
