Eric Ogden / Showtime Listen Listening.../ Originally published on June 14, 2019 8:27 am A new TV show, set in Boston in the 1990s, centers on some action-packed armored-car robberies. A crime drama in Boston: You've heard this before. But City on a Hill, which premieres Sunday on Showtime, is aiming for distinction. It stars actor Aldis Hodge as a straight-and-narrow assistant district attorney working within a crooked justice system. He's new in town, and determined to take on these robbery cases .\" In order to do his job right, he has to kind of play their game and play kind of by their rules a little bit, \"Hodge says in an interview .\" So he's got to get his hands dirty. \"And that means teaming up with a corrupt, racist FBI agent, played by <mark>Kevin Bacon</mark>. The two form something like a buddy-cop duo--except they certainly aren't buddies .\" I keep saying that these guys are two titans in a ring, boxing it out, \"Hodge says. In an interview, he spoke about the racism in the world of the show, his\" disciplinarian \"mother and a career that began as a child actor on Sesame Street and in Die Hard with a Vengeance. Interview Highlights On the racism of <mark>Kevin Bacon</mark>'s character I remember talking to the director of the show when we did the pilot, and even the writers now, about the tone of how this character handles racism ....I grew up around racism. I grew up between New York and [New] Jersey. And most people didn't realize that there was a KKK presence in Jersey in the part of town where I grew up. So I grew up around it. So as far as it comes to dealing with our characters together, we play the honesty of it. And this is what we go through today. I've even been through it this year alone in New York...I've had a Caucasian man a couple of months ago call me the n-word ....To my face, yeah. I've had another Caucasian man in his 50s call me to my face, said,\" You're intimidating because you're black. \"I said,\" What? What did you say? \"And in that, I had to invoke my own power within myself to understand my value, because: I'm a human being. I'm not intimidating. And I know what I bring to the table, and I know how I treat people. I was brought up with respect, and in that, I mean I give respect because I see the value in other people. That's what my mother taught me. It's weird that people don't realize that we live in this reality continuously. Aldis Hodge stars opposite <mark>Kevin Bacon</mark> as unlikely collaborators in the period cop drama City on a Hill. Claire Folger / Showtime On his mother Both my parents were Marines; so they met in the Corps. My brother [Edwin Hodge, also an actor] and I were both born while they were in service. And moms--so she was a single parent; I was raised in a single-parent household--but moms was, she was no joke. She was not a game up in here! Oh man! My mother was very much a disciplinarian. On time is late, early is on time, that kind of thing. And us, even though we were in the business, back in Jersey and New York we were still poor. We've been homeless three different times. I believe the last time I was homeless was when we moved to LA--I think I was 10. We used to live in our car at a certain point and all that. And for everything, my mom was like: Education is your way out. So she was not playing about the education. My mom reinforced the value of who we were in us continuously. And she--you know, she sacrificed a lot so that we may pursue our dreams ....Look, she was very conscious of the fact that she's a single mom raising two black men in a world that would not be so kind to them. What happens when the acting goes south? What will you know? So with acting, she made us earn it. She said,\" Look, if you're not bringing home As and Bs, you ain't going to see no audition. I don't care what's happening. \"And you know, on set--my mom, she's from the South, she's from Florida--like, she'll snatch us up in front of anybody. You acting out, you gon' get your butt whooped here, now, today, in front of everybody, and you gon' go back...you gon' do your job, because you chose this. On having a 30-year acting career at age 32 I've had to reevaluate my relationship with this industry. Because when I was a teenager, all I was getting was, like, thug role auditions and athlete role auditions. And I remember, I was always a science nerd. I was like: Black people are more than this. Like, that's cool and all, but it has to have a purpose. It can't just be for the sake of\" this is all we see you as. \"Now, 30 years in the game, I've spent this entire time trying to figure out...what I'm doing here, and demanding more of this career for me. So I've made sacrifices. There are jobs I didn't take, auditions I didn't go on. It all amounts to where I am now. And you have to actively participate in your fate, in your future. So I got a mission. And make sure that when people see me, they see a man of content and moral fiber. And somebody who didn't sell out. And that's the path I hope to walk for the rest of my career.

If only the Europeans could find some way to do it. By <mark>Keith Johnson</mark> | June 14, 2019, 3:20 PM A photo illustration of euro, U.S. dollar, and British pound notes on Oct. 13, 2017. Matt Cardy/Getty Images Europe's quest to find an alternative to U.S. financial dominance and the global rule of the dollar has only intensified since French and German leaders first howled about the need to recover their economic sovereignty last summer. But European governments are finding that coming up with a workable plan is a lot easier said than done--leaving them fuming but still vulnerable to Washington's strong-arm tactics. That doesn't mean, however, the Europeans are going to give up trying--and that poses a long-term danger to U.S. power. Countries such as France and Germany first bristled at the Trump administration's decision to unilaterally pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose crippling sanctions on Iran, putting European firms squarely in the crosshairs of U.S. sanctions. America's Iran policy still rankles, and Europe's efforts to create a so-called special purpose vehicle to enable some trade with Iran continue, with meetings taking place this week even with oil tankers ablaze just outside the Persian Gulf. But since the return of the Iran sanctions last year, the Trump administration has dramatically stepped up its use of sanctions and other economic weapons to force friends and foes alike to cow to its foreign-policy wishes. In addition to a tougher line on Iran, there have been increasing, crippling sanctions on Venezuela, including a blanket prohibition on any countries providing help for Venezuela's oil industry; further sanctions on Russian banks and individuals and repeated threats of U.S. sanctions on European firms working on a Russian gas pipeline in Germany; threats of sanctions against Turkey, a NATO ally, for its defense procurement decisions; and even an unprecedented application of 1990s-era Cuba legislation that is a direct threat to companies in Europe and elsewhere. Those sanctions come on top of a slew of heavy-handed trade actions, from huge tariffs on China meant to force Beijing to change its entire economic system to a tariff threat on Mexico designed to strong-arm the country into changing its migration policies--not to mention the Trump administration's campaign to get countries around the world to blacklist China's Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment-maker. All this bullying from Washington is made possible because the U.S. dollar remains the world's reserve currency and the most used in cross-border transactions. Even so, the Trump administration is taking a risk in resorting to this financial weapon with an abandon seldom seen before, said John E. Smith, who stepped down last year as head of the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions arm. \"It's of deep concern that the more the U.S. pushes Europe away from a common policy, the more they push Europe into finalizing true alternatives to the U.S. financial system,\" which will ultimately weaken the United States' economic power and its ability to effectively wield sanctions, said Smith, now the co-head of the national security group at Morrison & Foerster. So far, adverse reaction to U.S. financial actions is boosting the euro's prospects--a bit. \"[G] rowing concerns about the impact of international trade tensions and challenges to multilateralism, including the imposition of unilateral sanctions, seem to have lent support to the euro's global standing\" over the past year, the European Central Bank (ECB) concluded Thursday in its annual report on the use of the euro. While the euro's share of cross-border transactions stayed about the same--just under one-third of all transactions--the euro's share in global foreign exchange reserves grew over the last year, while the dollar dropped to its lowest level in almost 20 years. The ECB said some central banks are reducing dollar exposure due to the risk of unilateral actions. This week, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire rebuffed U.S. pressure to ban Huawei, citing the need to protect French sovereignty. This month, the governor of the Banque de France and a contender to become the next head of the ECB, called for a greater role for the euro to restore Europe's financial sovereignty. Leading French lawmakers, meanwhile, rail against U.S. extraterritorial sanctions and fret for the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Even Spain has fought back furiously against the U.S. revival of Cuba sanctions that threaten its leading businesses. While the United States has aggressively used its central position in the global financial system to impose sanctions on rogue actors since the 1990s, what President Donald Trump is doing is a whole new order of magnitude, Smith said. \"The Trump administration is far more willing to confront even allies and seek to force changes to their foreign-policy position using threats of sanctions, as well as trade threats,\" he said. \"We're hearing now from France and Germany what we used to hear from China and Russia .\" The problem for U.S. allies in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere that are seeking a way around U.S. financial muscle is that it is proving extremely tough to unwind more than seven decades of dollar dominance. The U.S. financial system remains the central nervous system for the bulk of financial transactions. That gives U.S. policymakers the ability to squeeze other countries that is simply unmatched anywhere else, despite decades of sporadic efforts by countries like Japan, China, and others to make their currencies and banking systems an alternative. That is especially evident with Europe's effort to sustain trade with Iran through \"INSTEX,\" a special financial vehicle designed to allow limited trade in humanitarian goods and medicine despite U.S. sanctions. After a year of trying, Europe and Iran still don't have the system up and running. More to the point, however much European governments (and Brussels) would like to honor their commitments to Iran under the auspices of the 2015 accord, European businesses have a calculus of their own--and that doesn't include taking on the U.S. Treasury. \"Companies, even Russian and Chinese companies, do what is in their best interest. And even in Russia and China, they don't automatically subordinate that self-interest to the wishes of the government,\" said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley. \"For the moment, using dollars remains convenient and economical from the company point of view .\" That's one reason why since last year the European Union has been redoubling efforts to carve out a greater international role for the euro, the world's second-most important currency. Last fall, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called for deeper economic and monetary reforms to boost the euro's role in the global economy, which would help shield Europe from \"selfish unilateralism\" by others. \"The euro must become the face and the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,\" Juncker said. Late last year, the European Commission rolled out a road map to strengthen the euro's international role, including completing true monetary union 20 years after the launch of the European currency by creating real pan-European banking and capital markets, which remain fragmented along national lines. Another key plank is to use the euro more, and the dollar less, in the energy sector; despite being the biggest energy importer in the world, Europe mostly pays in dollars for oil, coal, and natural gas. This week, the commission reported that consultations with a wide range of industries showed \"broad support for reducing dependence on a single dominant global currency\" and \"recognition that the EU, through the euro, can reinforce its economic sovereignty .\" The euro, the commission found, is the only currency that can realistically compete with the dollar. But Europe is still struggling to make its own money the currency of choice for seemingly logical things, such as the 300 billion euros the continent spends every year importing energy--the overwhelming share of which is actually paid for in dollars, which go through U.S. banks under the eye of U.S. authorities. And European Commission officials stress that a lot more progress must be made on creating the European monetary and banking union, and especially a true pan-European capital market, to better be able to compete with the dollar and U.S. financial might. \"What's holding the euro back? National financial markets in Europe still lack the breadth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets because they're segmented along national lines,\" Eichengreen said. Still, he said, \"Rome wasn't built in a day. These pilot projects augur what is to come. It will just take time to get there .\" The United States and Europe have had plenty of deep-seated economic spats before, from disputes over trade and monetary policy in the 1970s to decades-long fights over agriculture, industrial subsidies, and tariffs. But America's recent insistence on using its financial might to strong-arm even its closest allies into doing its bidding is a whole new ballgame--with potentially lasting consequences, Smith said. \"The United States has pushed Europe on this issue to the breaking point, where capitals across Europe are looking for alternatives, and at some point some of those alternatives will bear fruit .\" View Comments Tags: Economics, European Union, Finance, Trade Trending Now Sponsored Links by Taboola By Taboola More from Foreign Policy By Taboola Read More The Buck Stops Here: Europe Seeks Alternative to U.S.-Dominated Financial System Germany and France complain that the U.S. is abusing sanctions power to bully even its allies.

Thousands of Hong Kong residents are expected to return to the streets on Sunday to protest a controversial extradition bill, which the government has decided to suspend under pressure from massive protests in the past week. Protesters said on Saturday afternoon that Hong Kong leader <mark>Carrie Lam</mark>'s about-face decision to put the bill on ice did not appease them. \"I think the majority of Hong Kong people will not accept temporary suspension,\" said protester Thomas Hong, who was participating in a 10-person hunger strike outside government offices. <mark>Lam</mark> said she decided to suspend the proposed legislation, which is controversial because it would allow extraditions to China, as much of the public still has \"concerns and doubts about the bill .\" She emphasised the bill would not be revoked but simply suspended for further consultation.

They were also asking the government to reclassify Wednesday's rally from riot to protest and release and not prosecute those arrested.
