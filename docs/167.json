Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential race, the California Democrat has slid from an enviable front-runner position in her home state into the single digits in a new poll of likely voters in the Golden State. As the state's March 5 primary draws closer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (23%), former Vice President Joe Biden (22%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) are now tied as the leaders in the field among likely voters who are either registered as Democrats or identify as Democratic-leaning independents in the new Public Policy Institute of California poll, which was conducted in mid - to late September after Harris' uneven performance in the last debate. Harris tumbled from 19% in July to 8% in the new poll by the institute, failing to sustain the momentum she sparked with her first debate performance in June. She lost significant ground over the summer, while her chief rivals all solidified their standing among California voters. In the July poll, Warren was at 15%, Sanders was at 12% and Biden was at 11%--all trailing Harris, who got both a fundraising and a polling bounce after she delivered a fiery performance in the first debate in Miami by questioning the former vice president's past opposition to busing for the purpose of desegregating schools. While it is often said that California tends to reflect the national state of play of the presidential race--because it is so expensive to wage an intensive campaign in this vast and diverse state--the new Public Policy Institute of California poll underscores that Harris does not seem to be drawing any advantage from the fact that she served as the state's attorney general and continues to serve constituents as the state's junior US senator. \"These numbers reflect what's going on in the national scene, but they also reflect that there is not a home state advantage (for Harris). There's not an advantage from the fact that she's run in statewide races here in 2010, 2014 and 2016,\" said Mark Baldassare, who directs the survey and is the institute's president and CEO. Harris' supporters and advisers had hoped she would be able to rack up a considerable number of delegates in California when the state holds its Super Tuesday contest, building momentum that would carry her into the spring primaries. \"Sen. Harris has to prove to (California) voters just like any other Democratic presidential candidate--\"What are you going to do for me?' and\" Where do you stand on the issues?' and \"Are you the person who is most likely to defeat <mark>Donald Trump</mark>?\" Baldassare said. \"The name identification associated with being the state's senator and somebody who's been on the ballot--it's not an advantage right now.\" The new California poll numbers come as Harris' campaign is restructuring its leadership and attempting to streamline its decision-making. After stumbling through a fog of confusion about her position on the single-payer \"Medicare for All\" proposal and amid falling poll numbers over the past three months--including in South Carolina, where a recent survey showed her at 3%--Harris is moving her Senate chief of staff, Rohini Kosoglu, and senior adviser Laphonza Butler into top leadership positions within the campaign. Harris--who has notched a series of firsts in her career, including becoming California's first female attorney general of color--has acknowledged at campaign events that she faces some unique hurdles; namely, as she likes to point out, that Americans have never elected a president who looks her. But she has vowed to soldier on. During a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles, she laughed when retelling the story of how a reporter recently overheard her telling fellow Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, \"I'm f ***** g moving to Iowa,\" which will hold its first-in-the-nation caucuses on February 3. That comment was heard far and wide, and Harris noted to laughter that the famed Des Moines T-shirt company RAYGUN is printing her remark on one of its shirts. As they strategize for the Golden State primary, Harris and all of the other Democratic candidates will have to contend with a darkening mood among California voters they see signs of weakness in the US economy and grapple with a homelessness crisis statewide. Homelessness ranked as the most important issue facing the state for the first time in the Public Policy Institute of California survey's 20-year history, according to Baldassare. That was followed by voters' concerns about jobs and the economy, as well as rising housing costs--which have contributed to increasing numbers of Californians living on the streets. Baldassare noted that homelessness moving to the top of the list of concerns was an astonishing finding. \"It's just incredible,\" Baldassare said. \"It's visible, and it's a growing issue ....It's a very tough issue. It's disturbing for people to see the suffering that's occurring--it's something that doesn't fit with their image of what should be going on in their community. And they're frustrated that the government seems incapable of getting its hands around it. It's not just a San Francisco or an LA issue anymore. It's everywhere.\" Signs of economic uncertainty are also weighing on California voters. A year ago, 53% of Californians said they expected to see good economic times over the following 12 months. Now only 41% of the state's residents said they expected good times over the next year, while 50% said they expect bad times financially. \"More people are getting nervous about the direction of the economy,\" Baldassare said. \"That's a big change. That speaks to some combination of political and economic uncertainty really surfacing--and that has impacts on what choices people make when they go to the ballot. They tend to feel more negative about incumbents and officeholders, because they feel like,\" Why aren't they doing something about this?' They're going to be looking for some message of hope or a plan for what they're going to do if things get worse. \"The Public Policy Institute of California survey was conducted via telephone from September 16 to 25 with 1,705 California adult residents. The results have a + / - 3.2 percentage point sampling margin of error for all adults, a + / -3.7 percentage point sampling margin of error for 1,344 registered voters and a + / - 4.2 percentage point sampling margin of error for 1,031 likely voters.

In 1996, Bunch was found guilty in Indiana for the arson-murder of her 3-year old son. She proclaimed her innocence for the next 16 years behind bars, until she was finally exonerated in 2012. She was 22 years old and six months pregnant with her second son when she first entered prison. Several years later, Bunch saved cookies for a pregnant fellow inmate, a small kindness that unexpectedly helped her find a lawyer to take her case. \"I knew what it was like to be pregnant in prison,\" recalls Bunch, \"so I would bring this girl cookies from the kitchen. One day, she asked me about my case, and then she wrote to her lawyer about me.\" Bunch's case was eventually taken up by the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law, which obtained previously withheld documents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, along with her son's autopsy report, which directly contradicted the initial arson investigation and showed that the trailer house fire was accidental. Tasting freedom for the first time since she was arrested at age 21, Bunch went to a restaurant near the courthouse in Columbus, Ind., and ate a celebratory lunch: scallops, cheese grits, a platter of hummus and vegetables, and champagne. It was a meal that ended up becoming the first image in a series titled \"First Meal\" by <mark>Julie Green</mark>, a visual artist and professor of art at Oregon State University. <mark>Green</mark>, who is known for another project called \"The Last Supper,\" an ongoing series depicting the final meals of death row prisoners, is now documenting first meals eaten by exonerated prisoners. <mark>Green</mark> met Bunch in 2015, when her work was being exhibited at Northwestern University's Block Museum. The concept for the new series was already incubating in <mark>Green</mark>'s mind, however, from a conversation she'd had back in 2000 with Oklahoma State University art department chair Jim Folts. \"Jim said,\" When you end the [Last Supper] series, you could paint a final plate: a first meal of an exoneree,' \"says <mark>Green</mark>, who has a goal of immortalizing 50 death row meals each year until capital punishment is abolished--and has completed 800 so far.\" Eighteen years later, I am doing just that, painting First Meal. I couldn't wait any longer. \"<mark>Green</mark> views this series, and her other work, in the same way, saying,\" I hope the viewer will consider the margin for error in the judicial process. \"First Meal' may bring about conversation that could lead to positive change. Art can do that.\" Bunch wasn't intending on becoming the subject of a painting when she met <mark>Green</mark>, but wanted to find out if <mark>Green</mark> had yet documented the final meal--which included enchiladas and pie--of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was convicted of the arson-murder of his three young children in 1992 and executed in Texas in 2004. The forensic evidence in Willingham's case, eerily similar to that which convicted Bunch, has been questioned in the years since his death. \"<mark>Julie</mark> told me she hadn't had time to create his plate yet,\" says Bunch, \"but then she contacted me later and sent me a reproduction of what his plate would look like. It touched me so much that she did that, so when I heard about the new project, I was absolutely on board with participating.\" Sara Sommervold, a fellow and attorney at the Center on Wrongful Convictions, sees the \"First Meal\" project as one that, like \"The Last Supper\" series, helps to humanize convicted prisoners. \"That first meal is a very profound event in an exoneree's life,\" says Sommervold. \"The inability to choose food in prison, the absence of color and flavor, these are all fundamental parts of the experience. It's no accident that so many exonerees choose colorful plates of food when they are released.\" One exoneree, who spent 15 years in prison for murder, spoke in his interview with the Center on Wrongful Convictions about being given an orange by a waitress during his first meal, and how he simply held it for more than half an hour, glorying in its color and scent, saying, \"The little things in life mean so much when you're deprived of them, but out in the world we take them for granted.\" With a goal of amassing 20 menus, Sommervold helps collect interviews with clients who have been exonerated, which <mark>Green</mark> then crafts into a visual representation--but the process is about more than paint. \"Naively, I thought\" First Meal' would be more uplifting to paint than \"The Last Supper,'\" says <mark>Green</mark>. \"Of course the meal is celebratory, but it is nothing compared to all those lost years. And how do you depict absence, not having an orange for seven years? How do you illustrate holding an orange for 40 minutes before savoring every bite?\" <mark>Green</mark>'s approach is inspired by her love for flow blue, a type of ceramic dishware--also called transferware--that originated in Staffordshire, England, in the early 19th century and is distinguished by its soft, or flowing, blue glaze. The decorative images on the pottery often depict scenes of pastoral countryside or happy celebrations, which <mark>Green</mark> felt could offer an interesting counterpoint to the underlying subject. She also often incorporates other symbolic imagery, like the state bird where the conviction took place or thumbprints representing DNA analysis. For the image of Bunch's first meal, <mark>Green</mark> says, \"I chose a transferware of an idyllic gathering to show the passage of time, and how surreal it must be to leave prison and be with your family and friends eating hummus and scallops.\" As the project continues to take shape, <mark>Green</mark> has begun incorporating text from the actual interviews into the images to help provide necessary context, such as an exoneree who described having a potluck-style first meal at a friend's home. Someone brought blueberries--the exoneree's favorite fruit--and hand-fed them to her in a moment of tenderness, a scene recreated by <mark>Green</mark> in the final piece. The subtlety of the imagery can be surprising when juxtaposed against the human tragedies that are at the root of the artwork. \"She's not your standard commercial gallery artist,\" says Theo Downes-LeGuin, who represents <mark>Green</mark> at Upfor Gallery in Portland, Ore. \"The power of art, and of this type of project, is that it gives people enough controversy to have that conversation, but also a safe place in which to discuss it.\" Kristen Hartke is a food writer based in Washington, D.C.

Just over six per cent of the $1.2 billion budget at HHS goes to administration, finance, human resources and communications, according to a national report released Wednesday. To compare, the national average is 4.5 per cent. Hamilton seniors declining faster than average in long-term care homes Joseph Brant was nearly double that at almost 8.5 per cent of its $150-million budget in the fiscal year starting April 1, 2013 and ending March 31, 2014. That is down from a high of 10.5 per cent the year before and nine per cent in 2011/2012. St. Joseph's Healthcare is below the national average at four per cent of its $600-million budget. The provincial average is just under six per cent, found the Canadian Institute for Health Information in its annual report on hospital performance, long-term care and the health of area residents. \"It's important to devote as many resources as we can to patient care,\" said Dr. <mark>David Higgins</mark>, president of St. Joseph's, which dropped its average by a percentage point in one year. \"It's a balancing act,\" said <mark>Higgins</mark>, noting organizations have to be careful not to spend too little on administration. \"We strive so that it is as low as we can reasonably achieve.\" HHS spent nearly $1.1 million on CEO salaries in 2014. New hire Rob MacIsaac was the second-highest paid hospital CEO in Ontario, making $757,583 in salary and taxable benefits. At the same time, HHS paid $312,618 to former CEO Murray Martin, revealed public salary disclosure released by the province in March. Both HHS and Joseph Brant say their higher than average administration costs are the result of one-time expenses. A $7-million pay equity payment caused HHS administration costs to rise to 6.2 per cent from just over 5.6 per cent the year before, says Dr. <mark>Richard McLean</mark>, executive vice-president of interprofessional practice and chief medical executive. \"It's not a reflection of the fact we have too many administrators. That's not what's going on.\" Joseph Brant claims its administration costs temporarily went up because of an internal operational review and a reorganization of the administration. \"It is something we monitor,\" said Susan Wannamaker, senior vice-president at Joseph Brant. The interactive report, which is available at www.cihi.ca, also found HHS and Joseph Brant do more caesarean sections for high-risk births than average. HHS has been around 16 per cent for four years while Joseph Brant has been at about 18 per cent for three years. The national average is 14 per cent and St. Joseph's is around 13 per cent. \"We're working on it,\" said <mark>McLean</mark>. \"C-section rates are creeping up everywhere. We are paying an increasing amount of attention to it.\" For St. Joseph's, the report flagged an issue with patients returning to hospital after discharge. The rates were higher than average for medical and surgical patients, as well for all hospital patients as a whole. Return rates were also slightly higher than average for surgical patients at HHS. \"We're focused very much on this,\" said <mark>Higgins</mark>. \"It's distressing for patients to come back to the hospital again. We want to do better.\" The biggest outlier was backlogs in the emergency department at Joseph Brant. The report found it takes more than 60 hours for nine out of 10 patients in the emergency department to get a bed in the Burlington hospital. That is more than double the provincial and national average. \"We know our numbers aren't where they need to be,\" said Wannamaker. \"We have a number of initiatives across the organization focused on patient flow.\" She stresses the numbers in the report are a \"point in time.\" \"It provides us with a goalpost,\" she said. \"But there are a lot of things that change.\" Innovative robotic hair

The acquisition process is expected to be completed in the next three to six months. Auctus has an API facility at the Pharmacity in Vishakhapatnam and an intermediate facility in Hyderabad. The API facility has approvals from leading regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration, European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Healthcare (EDQM), Health Canada, Korea Food and Drug Administration and WHO-Good Manufacturing Practices. . \"The acquisition of Auctus fits into our strategy of being a fully integrated manufacturer while diversifying our product portfolio by adding high-value products with significant market demand. We will be a market leader by implementing our operational excellence philosophy while leveraging Auctus regulatory approvals,\" Granules India managing director, <mark>Krishna Prasad</mark>, stated in a press release. \"We want to unlock our investment value and subsequently set up a greenfield pharmaceutical unit\" , a co-promoter of the 10-year old Auctus Pharma, Shivaram <mark>Prasad</mark> Aluru, told Business Standard while explaining the reasons for the sale of the company. Auctus' product portfolio includes twelve APIs including APIs in several therapeutic categories such as antihistaminic, antihypertensive, antithrombotic and anticonvulsant as well as other therapeutic categories. It currently sells its APIs and intermediates to customers in 50 countries. The team and assets from the acquisition will initially operate as a separate division with Granules. Granules also announced the opening of a 10,000 square foot research and development (R & D) facility in Hyderabad. The new R & D will focus on full scale generic API development and will supplement the company's existing R & D facility in Pune, which currently focuses on sustainable technology development.
