The Iberian neighbours will be favourites to progress from Group B after also being paired with Morocco and Iran in Friday's draw in Moscow, but they face each other first up in Sochi on June 15. Real Madrid's Ronaldo is just one of a number of Portugal's top players who ply their trade in Spain, but Lopetegui was keener to point to the overall qualities Portugal showed in claiming their first major trophy at Euro 2016 just 18 months ago. \"Straight away it isn't the time to talk about individuals,\" Lopetegui told Spanish TV station Cuatro. \"Portugal have won an important title and, moreover, very recently. They are the champions of Europe, they have fantastic players and we are talking about the highest level.\" Indeed, Portugal survived without an injured Ronaldo for the vast majority of the Euro 2016 final to shock hosts France thanks to an extra-time goal from Eder. However, Portugal have failed to beat Spain in seven previous meetings at major tournaments, including as the Spanish went on to lift their only World Cup in South Africa in 2010. \"What matters to us is to play a great game when the time comes and to be capable of beating them,\" added Lopetegui. \"The rest is history.\" Lopetegui was at least happy with Spain's draw in terms of logistics with their expected base in Krasnodar just a half an hour flight away from Sochi before facing Iran in Kazan and Morocco in Kaliningrad. \"Until it is official I can't say anything, but it is more than probable the base will be (Krasnodar),\" he added. \"Knowing the distances there could be in Russia, it is quite balanced.\" Iran's Portuguese coach <mark>Carlos Queiroz</mark>, who also had a brief spell in charge at Real Madrid, was more enthusiastic as he claimed he couldn't have wished for a better draw. \"Personally I am very happy because it is a group with two teams from two very special places for me,\" said <mark>Queiroz</mark>. \"It will be a very tough competition for us, it would have been no matter what group we were in, but when you are with Spain, a World Cup winner, and Portugal, European champions, it couldn't be better for me.\" \u00a9 AFP"}, {"articleID": "2019101700_00069224_W", "names": {"Pat Day": ["Q6813952", "Q7143355"], "Joe Higgins": ["Q1389005", "Q6210320"], "Frank Bruno": ["Q530220", "Q5485522"], "Sergio Mora": ["Q2036108", "Q25238177", "Q7454332"]}, "date": "2019-10-16", "url": "https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/boxer-dead-at-27-after-horror-punch/3856318/", "content": "Boxing Boxer dead at 27 after horror punch 17th Oct 2019 10:05 AM 0 Young boxing star Patrick <mark>Day</mark> has died from the injuries he suffered in a welterweight bout in Chicago last weekend.

It's how he inspired people and it was something that made him feel alive.\" It becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this.

While the White House says Obama has not approved military action inside Syria, additional intelligence on the militants would likely be necessary before he could take that step. Pentagon officials have been drafting potential options for the president, including airstrikes. One official said the administration has a need for reliable intelligence from Syria and called the surveillance flights an important avenue for obtaining data. Two U.S. officials said Monday that Obama had approved the flights, while another U.S. official said early Tuesday that they had begun. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter by name, and spoke only on condition of anonymity. The U.S. began launching strikes against the Islamic State inside Iraq earlier this month, with Obama citing the threat to American personnel in the country and a humanitarian crisis in the north as his rationale. Top Pentagon officials have said the only way the threat from the militants can be fully eliminated is to go after the group inside neighboring Syria as well. Obama has long resisted taking military action in Syria, a step that would plunge the U.S. into a country ravaged by an intractable civil war. However, the president's calculus appears to have shifted since the Islamic State announced last week that it had murdered American journalist <mark>James Foley</mark>, who was held hostage in Syria. The group is also threatening to kill other U.S. citizens being held by the extremists in Syria. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama has demonstrated his willingness to order military action when necessary to protect American citizens. \"That is true without regard to international boundaries,\" he said. The White House would not comment on Obama's decision to authorize surveillance flights over Syria. \"We're not going to comment on intelligence or operational issues, but as we've been saying, we'll use all the tools at our disposal,\" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. The U.S. had already stepped up its air surveillance of the Islamic State inside Iraq earlier this year as Obama began considering the prospect of airstrikes there. And the administration has run some surveillance missions over Syria, including ahead of an attempted mission to rescue <mark>Foley</mark> and other U.S. hostages earlier this summer. The U.S. special forces who were sent into Syria to carry out the rescue mission did not find the hostages at the location where the military thought they were being held. Officials who confirmed the failed rescue last week said the U.S. was continuing to seek out intelligence on the other hostages' whereabouts. Administration officials have said a concern for Obama in seeking to take out the Islamic State inside Syria is the prospect that such a move could unintentionally help embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. A top Syrian official said Monday any U.S. airstrikes without consent from Syria would be considered an aggression. The Islamic State is among the groups seeking Assad's ouster, along with rebel forces aided by the U.S.. The White House on Monday tried to tamp down the notion that action against the Islamic State could bolster Assad, with Earnest saying, \"We're not interested in trying to help the Assad regime.\" However, he acknowledged that \"there are a lot of cross pressures here.\" ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Johann \"Hans\" Breyer, a retired toolmaker, was arrested Tuesday outside his home in Northeast Philadelphia. He spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court, wearing an olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane. ADVERTISEMENT Legal filings unsealed Wednesday in the U.S. indicate the district court in Weiden, Germany, issued a warrant for Breyer's arrest the day before, charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder. Each count represents a trainload of Nazi prisoners from Hungary, Germany and Czechoslovakia who were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau between May 1944 and October 1944, the documents said. \"There was a heightened execution of Jewish deportees brought to the camp,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Foulkes told WTXF. \"Most of them were women, children and people with illness.\" Prosecutors say that Breyer, 18 at the time, served in the so-called Death's Head Guard Battalion at the camp. Attorney Dennis Boyle argued his client is too infirm to be detained pending a hearing on his possible extradition to Germany. Breyer has mild dementia and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes, Boyle said. \"Mr. Breyer is not a threat to anyone,\" said Boyle. \"He's not a flight risk.\" But Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice ruled the detention center was equipped to care for Breyer, who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature of the hearing. Breyer has admitted he was a guard at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II, but has told The Associated Press he was stationed outside of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million Jews and others behind the gates. <mark>Thomas Walther</mark>, a former federal prosecutor with the special office that investigates Nazi war crimes in Germany, now represents family members of some of Breyer's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case. He called for a speedy extradition. \"The German court has to find late justice for the crimes of Breyer and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs,\" <mark>Walther</mark> wrote in an email to the AP. \"It is late, but not too late.\" Prosecutors in Weiden could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Their investigation comes after years of failed U.S. efforts to have Breyer stripped of his American citizenship and deported. A court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the United States, mainly on the grounds that he had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it. His American citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born. During Breyer's arrest Tuesday, he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in his home that document his right to stay in the U.S., Donnelly testified. Breyer's wife and two grandsons attended the hour-long hearing in Philadelphia on Wednesday. His extradition hearing was scheduled for Aug. 21. Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, said he hoped there would be no obstacles to Breyer's extradition and trial overseas. \"Germany deserves credit for doing this - for extending and expanding their efforts and, in a sense, making a final attempt to maximize the prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators,\" he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 1 89-year-old man arrested on charges of aiding Nazi atrocities 2 Remains of 17 service members recovered from decades-old Alaska Globemaster crash 3 Sex offender apprehended with girl, 16, after high-speed chase 4 Oregon cat braves coyote country to make way to old home Should I Put My Vacation on a Credit Card?

They batted with the bases loaded six times, five of them in the first two innings and three of them against a starter, Brandon McCarthy, with wayward command. John Jaso walked with the bases loaded in the first, and Gregory Polanco did so to drive in another run in the second. But they could have used a hit or two in the middle of one of those rallies.

A different arrangement should be considered in Mount Airy, according to Brinkley, whose sentiments were echoed by Commissioner Jon Cawley. \"I think it made sense when it was $100,000 (per year), but it has grown,\" Cawley said of the present system that now involves significantly more money. Although the city budget reflects occupancy tax revenues of $360,000 for the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the final figure probably will be higher, city Finance Director Pam Stone said. She said it could total $400,000 - \"which is a good indicator that people are traveling.\" For the first five months of the fiscal year, through November, the revenues were up 10 percent over the same period in 2013. Cawley said he believes local citizens should be benefiting more from those funds. Changing Mount Airy's procedure of occupancy tax collection and dispensing would require special action by the N.C. General Assembly, according to City Attorney <mark>Hugh Campbell</mark>. That's because occupancy tax legislation is specific to each locality, he explained, including how the money is to be distributed and who can remit those funds and how. There was support at the retreat for seeking the required legislative change in Raleigh and Brinkley reiterated that Wednesday. \"Absolutely,\" she said. Brinkley emphasized during the retreat discussion that her desire to change the occupancy tax set-up does not signal any dissatisfaction with those who now administer the proceeds. \"This is not 'cause you're mad at anybody, or trying to create a mess,\" she said. It is simply a matter of the city needing to tap into additional revenue sources to meet several pressing needs, Brinkley said. Also discussed at the retreat was the possibility of an event fee that would be charged when organizations hold fund-raising walks or similar activities that require police and other services. Such a fee was first discussed a couple of years ago, but never materialized. Along with balancing the regular city budget, Mount Airy officials have been asked to fund a new fire truck, add parking at Reeves Community Center, develop a shell building to better attract industry and other projects in the next fiscal year. One target of TDA funding could be the redevelopment of the former Spencer's industrial site in downtown Mount Airy, Brinkley said. This might include funding a conference center that local tourism representatives have said would boost visitation here. Brinkley indicated that her position on the occupancy tax is bound to ruffle feathers - even with the group of which she is a member. \"I'm on the TDA board now,\" she said. \"But I may get kicked off after this.\" "}]
