castle\" actor kal penn addresses the democratic national convention in charlotte, n.c., on tuesday, sept. 4, 2012. geoff herbert, special to cleveland.com in 2008's \"harold & kumar go to guantanamo bay,\" the white castle-loving stoner kumar (played by kal penn) smoked marijuana with a fictional george w. bush. in real life, the 35-year-old actor served as associate director of the white house office of public engagement under president barack obama for two years. \"my favorite job was working for a boss who gave the order to take out bin laden,\" he said at tuesday night's democratic national convention in charlotte, north carolina. \"so thank you, invisible man in the chair, for that .\" the \"invisible man\" penn referred to is pres. obama, who was \"interviewed\" by veteran actor <mark>clint eastwood</mark> at last week's republican national convention. the 82-year-old actor talked to an empty chair as if obama were sitting there, inadvertently starting a internet meme called \"eastwooding .\" according to the new york daily news, penn's speech at the 2012 dnc was aimed to help the obama campaign with reaching younger voters, asking them to register to vote online: \"you don't even have to put pants on!\" penn also told viewers to tweet about his speech using the hashtag #sexyface, and the word instantly became a trending topic on twitter. the hill notes that he and his \"harold and kumar\" co-star <mark>john cho</mark> also appear in a youtube video promoting \"live from charlotte,\" a online program for the dnc to be hosted by penn on thursday night before the president's speech. the convention special will feature celebrities like <mark>marc anthony</mark>, <mark>elizabeth banks</mark>, aisha tyler and olivia wilde. in the 53-second spot, pres. obama is seen calling penn and asking him to take the job seriously as the two actors laugh and munch on junk food in front of the television. other hollywood stars have already appeared at the dnc in charlotte, too. \"glee\" actress amber riley sang the national anthem tuesday night, and celebrities spotted in the audience included \"wings\" actor <mark>tim daly</mark>, patricia arquette, wayne knight, alfre woodard, \"monk\" star tony shalhoub and john leguizamo. according to the guardian, even bigger names will be in town when pres. obama speaks thursday night. <mark>james taylor</mark>, foo fighters and mary j. blige are expected to perform, and actress jessica alba is hosting a convention closing party with musical guests scissor sisters and pitbull. todd williamson/invision/ap this aug. 22, 2012 photo shows betty white attending \"hot in cleveland\" co-star valerie bertinelli's star ceremony on the hollywood walk of fame in los angeles. but will there be a speaker that draws as much attention as <mark>eastwood</mark> at the rnc? perhaps \"off their rockers\" star betty white could do it. as of tuesday evening, more than 12,000 hopefuls have signed a petition and another 35,000 fans joined a facebook group to bring white to the democratic national convention. a similar online campaign in 2010 earned enough support to make the 90-year-old actress guest host for an episode of \"saturday night live .\" cbs reports white endorsed pres. obama for re-election in may, saying she liked \"how he represents us .\" he filmed a birthday greeting for the former \"golden girls\" star earlier this year as well, joking that she didn't believe her age and asked to see a copy of her birth certificate. both obama and vice president joe biden are scheduled to speak at the dnc on thursday. the petition is calling for white to introduce the commander in chief before his speech. what do you think? would you like to see betty white speak at the democratic national convention? could she get as much attention as <mark>clint eastwood</mark>?? the new york times: a tmz moment at the democratic convention? new york daily news: not as many stars attending dnc as they

after rough few months weber state football: football team opens season saturday at fresno state \"after this game, regardless of the outcome, we still have to have our foot on the gas .\" weber state interim head football coach jody sears let's face it, folks, this is a pretty tough way for somebody to start their head coaching career. see, you're the new head football coach at weber state university, but they've chosen to put that iffy qualifier \"interim\" in front of your title after you were suddenly thrust into the job when the other guy abruptly bailed for a better gig. so now it's turned into one of those classic good news/bad news scenarios: the good news is congratulations, you're the wildcats' head coach; the bad news is, uh, sorry, but your first two games are on the road against a couple of perennially strong football bowl subdivision programs. yep, we're talking fresno state and byu. hey, good luck with that! that's the difficult challenge jody sears inherited when he took over the wsu reins in late-april after john l. smith bolted from his alma mater for the greener pastures of the university of arkansas. the wildcats opened their season last saturday with a lopsided 37-10 loss at fresno. and this weekend, they'll make the bus ride south to provo to face the cougars, who whipped that \"other\" wsu team (washington state) last week, 30-6. while sears admits he might've had a \"holy, crap!\" moment or two when he first glanced at the wildcats' early season schedule, he's not looking around for a white towel to throw in when saturday's game kicks off at lavell edwards stadium - marking weber state's first game against byu since 1979. \"that's the hand you're dealt, and there's no sense crying and whining about it,\" sears said. \"it is what it is .\" when i was at eastern washington, we opened up at oregon state and then went to west virginia - back to back. so this isn't my first rodeo. i've been there and done that, man. \"but, really, this is just part of the process, and it's setting us up, i think, for the rest of the year. you're going to face that formidable of an opponent, you definitely know who you are and where your strengths are and where your weaknesses are. and now you can cater to it .\" i'd hate to go into our big sky season after beating some paddy-cakes or what have you and you kind of have a false sense of reality, \"he said .\" we're going to have some reality now and we're going to know who we are. \"utah utes, after a two-year break, it'll be rivalry renewed when utah, utah state square off friday

extra-inning win after blowing a four-run lead on friday night was the best outing of jacob turner's rookie season. the 21-year-old right-hander tossed six innings of two-run, four-hit ball while striking out three and walking just one. but with a predetermined pitch count falling somewhere between 80 and 85 pitches, turner's night ended at 81. considering the marlins have the 23rd-ranked bullpen era (4.08) in baseball, manager ozzie guillen's decision to pull turner seemed surprising--especially considering the pitch count wasn't revealed until after the game. \"i felt good, but obviously that's not my decision,\" turner said. \"i felt like i got stronger as the game went on .\" after the game, guillen said the front office will decide if turner pitches under a pitch count for the remainder of the season. acquired from the tigers in a late-july trade, turner is the marlins' third-ranked prospect according to mlb.com, and is considered one of the best pitching prospects in baseball, with a mid-90s sinker and poise on the mound. on the year, turner is 1-3 with a 6.44 era in 29 1/3 innings. with miami, he is 0-2 with a 5.29 era in 17 innings. \"we have to take care of everybody,\" guillen said. \"that's the reason we tried to stay away from him .\" washington--<mark>jose reyes</mark> added two triples in the marlins' 9-7 win over the nationals on friday night, tying him for the major league lead with 11. <mark>reyes</mark>' first triple came in the fourth inning and drove in justin ruggiano to put the marlins ahead 6-2. his second three-base hit in the 10th scored ruggiano and bryan petersen, giving miami the go-ahead runs. \"in that situation, maybe i like [triples] better,\" <mark>reyes</mark> said. \"the last one was to put my team ahead, and that was good, because it's never easy against the nationals. they always find a way to fight back. we're just happy with a win .\" <mark>reyes</mark> is now 5-for-9 in extra innings this season, with a single, a double, two triples and a home run. according to elias sports bureau, the last major league player to have a season with an \"extra-inning cycle\" was the cubs' ryne sandberg in 1984. worth noting? on friday, the marlins named outfielder marcell ozuna their minor league player of the month and right-hander <mark>jose fernandez</mark> minor league pitcher of the month for august. at class a jupiter, ozuna batted .365 (38-for-104) with eight home runs and 32 rbis in 27 games last month. <mark>fernandez</mark>, also with jupiter, went 4-0 with an 0.72 era over 25 innings and five starts

story; articles provided by wire services are not included in this search; stat pack; oldest fantasy football league in texas cparry @ tylerpaper.com david hight is the first engraved name on an all-important trophy of the texas football league. hight's quarterbacks for that winning season were dallas cowboys' <mark>danny white</mark> and philadelphia eagles' ron jaworski, with the legendary walter payton of the chicago bears as his starting running back. clearly, the tfl has been around long before the popularity of fantasy football exploded. tyler's reggie howell believes it's the oldest fantasy football league in the state and one of the oldest in the nation. \"thirty-three years is a longtime,\" said howell, who created tfl in 1980. \"i do know of a league in california that is celebrating its 50th year this year, and it was started by a couple of guys who were actually part owners of the oakland raiders. ron wolf, who went on to be general manager of the green bay packers, used to play in that thing .\" the 33rd draft of the tfl was a few hours before kickoff of the dallas cowboys-new york giants game on wednesday. the league has always been composed of seven teams. the owners are all area residents: glenn smith, kirk brookshire, les loggins, howell, kearby herrington, <mark>bill adams</mark> and doug danley. howell had the first pick wednesday and took arian foster, houston texans running back. thirty-three years ago, the first player drafted was a dynamic running back named earl campbell. \"i really don't know what triggered it, but i remember watching a preseason game (in 1980) and saying,\" wouldn't it be fun if we could get points for what they do,' \"said howell, vice president of business development for karis resources in tyler .\" so i wrote up some rules, and amazingly they are pretty similar to today. \"howell moved to tyler a couple years later and continued the tfl in his new home with a few new owners. one of those was longtime friend and college golf teammate glenn smith. smith said he was apprehensive when howell approached him, but agreed to give it a try .\" he came to me and said, \"you're going to love this,'\" said smith, who owns glenn a. smith homes, a home-building company in tyler. smith said fantasy football in those early decades was not a regular part of the sports landscape like it is today. friends and relatives did not understand. there were questions: why are you so intense now on sundays? the cowboys won, so why are you so unhappy? or the ultimate, the cowboys just lost, why are you smiling? \"i was watching a cowboys game, and the philadelphia eagles scored, and i yelled,\" yeah!' smith recalled. \"i got the dirtiest looks from my family that you've ever seen .\" howell had a weekly ritual monday to take his usa today paper and scour it for stats on sunday's nfl games. and he wasn't the only one. every owner admitted to spending many hours amassing as much statistical information as possible about their players. \"people didn't understand what we were doing,\" said loggins, who has played in the league since 1983. \"the thing that is interesting is i am kind of a college football person. i was a cowboys fan, but i got involved with this, and it got me starting to watch (pro football).\" we started out having to dig out our stats in newspapers, and usa today was our newspaper of choice, and sometimes they'd get the stats wrong. \"football viewers today can see statistics scrolling by on their television screens during games. but loggins remembers a time when the only televised games seen sundays were ones shown on cbs or nbc, and the only way to get up-to-date stats was to watch the games and keep the stats yourself .\" that is the stuff that people can't appreciate, \"loggins said .\" you'd have a piece of paper, and you were watching one game and trying to keep up with how your player was doing. \"smith said the league improved dramatically thanks to espn premiering\" primetime \"in 1987. a highlight show hosted by sportscaster chris berman,\" primetime \"showed every game's scoring plays and other big plays. that allowed tfl owners to not have to wait on the newspaper the next day to get statistics .\" that was such a big deal, \"smith said. player transactions, such as trades or scooping up unrostered players, now can be done with a mouse click, but in those days, it was a race to see who could dial their telephone the quickest and tell the league commissioner about a player pickup. anyone with a rotary phone was in trouble .\" you'd be watching the game and see a running back for the cowboys go down with (an injury), \"loggins said .\" everybody would pick up the phone and try to call in and the first one who got through to (howell) would be able to pick up the backup. \"there was an opening in the tfl 13 years ago with an owner pulling out, and herrington (who was first on the waiting list), jumped at the opportunity .\" i thought it was crazy when i first heard about it, but then i wanted in, \"said herrington, a representative from feliciano financial group in tyler. while many leagues do head-to-head matchups each week, tfl pits all seven team's scores each week and puts them against one another. for instance, if howell's team scored 130 points, and that ranked second overall, he would be 5-1 that week, with the team ahead of him going 6-0. the league continues this way through the playoffs until the winner is the team with the best record at the close of the season .\" part of our strategy, even in our draft, is to try and prognosticate the playoffs and pick players who will be on those teams, \"herrington said. the positive with this type of scoring is in tfl, unlike the nfl, the best team throughout the entire season is the winning team. howell and smith have their names engraved on the tfl trophy the most .\" people have left and come back after playing other leagues, and everybody has always told me that this is the best league they've played in, \"howell said. memories in the 1987 afc championship game, a fumble by cleveland browns running back ernest byner has forever haunted their memory and added more mystique to the winning team, which had denver quarterback john elway. but that fumble also created havoc in the tfl final standings .\" that night we went to sleep thinking that one guy had won the championship and we didn't realize that ernest byner, on that play, had given his owner 100 yards and that boosted up his score enough to finish first, \"howell said .\" so when we woke up the next morning and looked at the stats, everything changed. \"the other owners admitted that smith takes the league much more seriously than the rest of them, to the point that he\" crawls into a dark room and you won't see him for months (when his team struggles), \"loggins said in jest. that obsession is shown in a letter smith still has that was sent from <mark>joe gibbs</mark> after smith wrote the former washington redskins coach and asked why he was not playing running back ricky ervins more .\" i am not any more obsessed than the rest of them, but yeah, i did that, \"smith admitted .\" ervins had been giving the redskins some huge games, but then all of a sudden, (<mark>gibbs</mark>) wouldn't play him. i copied some clippings of his stats from a couple games and highlighted him. i lied and said in the letter that i was a huge washington redskins fan, and i've got these stats and just wonder why you are not playing him more. \"well, he sent a letter back that said i really appreciate you being a fan of the redskins and i will give consideration to what you said; signed, <mark>joe gibbs</mark>.\" smith said the letter had no effect on ervins' playing time the rest of the season. in another year, howell completed a trade with an owner who was a lawyer and that player tore his acl the next week. \"one day i was at the office, and a sheriff's deputy was there and he handed me a summons,\" howell said. \"i look at it and i am being sued in the universal court of man for damages because i knew about <mark>stump mitchell</mark> before i traded him. it was a well-written two-page document .\" howell said the reasons he formed the league three decades ago are the same: everyone still enjoys it today.", "articleID": "2012091019_00056757_W", "names": {"Bill Adams": ["Q23302614", "Q4907865"]}}]
