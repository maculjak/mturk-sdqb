newswise - at a time when the country is looking for research-based solutions to its most pressing problems-finding renewable energy sources, addressing climate changes and advancing conservation efforts-it must encourage and champion promising practices. involving undergraduate students in research and scholarship fosters an engaged learning practice and provides a vehicle for creating new knowledge. four faculty members who share a commitment to such hands-on research for their undergraduate students were recently honored as u.s. professors of the year through a program sponsored by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching. \"we applaud these faculty members on their accolade and for investing their time and effort in undergraduate research,\" said cur executive officer nancy hensel. \"by creating opportunities for their students to pursue undergraduate research, these professors are fostering excellence in learning and contributions to the country's research enterprise .\" the honored professors include <mark>wei chen</mark>, professor of biomedical engineering at the university of central oklahoma in edmond, okla.; jerusha detweiler-bedell, associate professor of psychology at lewis & clark college in portland, ore.; eugenia paulus, professor of chemistry at north hennepin community college in brooklyn park, minn.; and michael wesch, assistant professor of cultural anthropology at kansas state university in manhattan, kan. prof. detweiler-bedell's teaching transcends the classroom, and has developed a cocurricular program that has her undergraduates studying a research topic outside class and over time. she does this to prepare them for graduate studies, and provides them opportunities to design their own studies, write research proposals, collect and analyze unique data, and present their findings at national meetings. emphasizing individualized learning based on the student's knowledge and abilities, prof. <mark>chen</mark> supports his undergraduate students in their design research projects and independent research. he advocates a collaborative approach to research, and his biomedical-engineering students work in the laboratories of neighboring universities, research foundations, and medical companies. prof. <mark>chen</mark> says, \"experiential learning through inquiry-based undergraduate research is essential to give our students the competitive edge in today's global economy .\" in another recent nod to the importance of undergraduate research from a university president, it was reported that amy gutmann, president of the university of pennsylvania, made a $100,000 gift to her university to support undergraduate research. about cur: the council on undergraduate research (www.cur.org) supports faculty development for high-quality undergraduate student-faculty collaborative research and scholarship. nearly 600 institutions and 3000 individuals belong to cur. cur believes that the best way to capture student interest and create enthusiasm for a discipline is through research in close collaboration with faculty members.", "articleID": "2008120216_00018907_W", "names": {"Wei Chen": ["Q30504047",

high of $147.27 hit in july, and some 16 per cent from last week, as demand is seen weakening worldwide and analysts expect it to contract this year and next. us light crude for january delivery fell

down 34 cents to $45.10. \"stabilisation in macroeconomic expectations is likely to precede any switch in oil market sentiment away from a mainly demand-side focus,\" barclays capital said in its weekly oil data review. bullish oil data on wednesday pushed prices higher during the session, when the us energy information administration said crude stocks fell 400,000 barrels in the week to november 28th, against an expected 1.7 million barrels build. distillate stocks, which include heating oil, fell 1.7 million barrels to 125 million, against a forecast for a 300,000-barrel increase, while gasoline supplies dropped 1.6 million barrels, having been expected to rise by 900,000 barrels. but the product inventory falls came amid lower refinery utilization, which fell 1.9 percentage

found a way to keep them quiet. people say boosters hire coaches, but i'm not so sure in this case. i tried calling <mark>byrne</mark> this morning to gauge his reaction to sylvester croom's recent public comments, and then i texted him a few minutes ago. he said on the day croom resigned that he would not speak to the media about the search until a coach was hired, and i guess he's through talking about croom. speaking of croom, in light of the revelation that there was going to be a change at offensive coordinator, i do wonder what else, if anything, <mark>byrne</mark> wanted croom to change. maybe croom could elaborate, but that would require returning my call. but i digress. <mark>byrne</mark> can't keep everyone quiet. as i and/or others have already noted, he was in kansas city over the weekend - ostensibly to see oklahoma offensive coordinator <mark>kevin wilson</mark>, and perhaps others - and florida offensive coordinator dan mullen has possibly been in touch with msu.
