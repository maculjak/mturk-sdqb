thomas edison patented it in 1879. more than one hundred years later, the familiar bulbs still push electricity through a wire filament - and still waste a whole lot of energy. ninety percent of the energy pumped through an incandescent light bulb is wasted as heat; that's why traditional bulbs are so hot to the touch. however, thanks to a piece of 2007 legislation, traditional incandescent bulbs will soon become a thing of the past. the bush-era law, called the energy independence and security act, set energy-efficiency standards for light bulbs that will come fully into effect in 2012. the law will require light bulbs to use 25-30 percent less power than incandescents use today. it's a mandate that will quickly slash residential and commercial energy use, lowering the nation's carbon footprint and utility bills at the same time. predicted savings include $13 billion in energy costs and the prevention of 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, reported noah horowitz, senior scientist at the natural resources defense council's energy program, in a blog post. overall, the legislation will save as much electricity each year as that used by all the homes in the state of texas. in theory, the legislation sounds like a no-brainer. australia, brazil and the european union have already enacted their own, parallel laws. yet in the united states, some consumers and activists have interpreted the act as a ban on incandescent bulbs. others believe that energy-efficient alternatives will necessarily cost more, deliver lower quality light and pose a health risk. texas congressman <mark>joe barton</mark> recently proposed a repeal of the legislation, and editorials occasionally crop up in leading newspapers, from the wall street journal to the washington times, protesting the \"light bulb ban .\" true, energy efficiency standards will inevitably make most incandescent bulbs obsolete, and give a boost to their more energy-efficient competitors, compact florescent bulbs (cfls) and light emitting diodes (leds). yet \"no one is requiring you to buy a cfl-not now, not ever,\" horowitz wrote. \"the regulation is simply making manufacturers build you a better bulb .\" cfl and led proponents point out that alternative lighting options are becoming cheaper, safer and more aesthetically pleasing every day, and that the legislation will force manufacturers to make them even better. for consumers, the biggest deterrent to choosing cfls and leds \"is the initial cost,\" says <mark>brian howard</mark>, web editor at green lighting. yet although cfls and leds cost more initially, <mark>howard</mark> explains, over time they can save consumers hundreds of dollars in reduced energy costs. cfls use four times less energy to run and last ten times as long as traditional incandescents: this means that each bulb, over its lifetime, actually costs $30 less than an incandescent. think of it this way: incandescents cost less upfront, but come will sneaky hidden fees. another complaint <mark>howard</mark> often hears, he says, is \"i tried a cfl years ago, and i hated it .\" <mark>howard</mark> points out that technology has improved radically since bulbs first hit the market. consumers can now buy energy-efficient bulbs that fit pretty much any light fixture and choose from a whole range of light effects. a while cfls do contain mercury, with proper handling, they produce a minimal health risk. each cfl bulb carries about 5 milligrams of mercury, \"just enough to cover a ballpoint pen tip .\" \"unless you wipe up mercury [without gloves] and then lick your hand, you're probably going to be okay,\" says russ leslie, associate director of the lighting research center at rensselaer polytechnic institute, as reported by popular mechanics. popular mechanics crunched the numbers and discovered that traditional incandescent bulbs actually introduce more mercury into the environment over their product life cycle. because incandescents consume more energy, they're responsible for a greater amount of pollution associated with electricity generation, including the release of trace amounts of mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the surrounding environment. over the next couple of years, you'll probably see fewer and fewer incandescent bulbs on store shelves - and hear a lot more from pundits, both on the right and left, about the light bulb legislation. the best way to cut through the hype? try out some energy-efficient alternatives, and find out how they can fit your

wireless connections on students to be examined alex de medeiros teaches a grade 8 career/health class equiped with wi-fi laptops at gordon head school in victoria, b.c. november 19, 2010. photograph by: darren stone, victoria times-colonist health worries over the use of wi-fi in schools have spread to victoria. greater victoria trustees, who oversee nearly 20,000 students in 43 schools, are taking a closer look at concerns about wi-fi--or wireless-fidelity, the wireless link that connects laptops and other devices to the internet. most of the district's secondary and middle schools have wi-fi, as do several elementary facilities. presentations about possible health issues caused by wi-fi were first made to the board in the spring. there were more last week by a group of speakers. as a result of the most recent session, the district is forming a committee to study wi-fi usage, and is inviting trustees, district workers, members of the victoria confederation of parent advisory councils and the public to take part. district secretary-treasurer george ambeault will lead the committee, which is due to make a report next spring .\" if there's any level of concern about it, then we need to be able to at least respond to people's questions, \"board chairman tom ferris said .\" if we're going to do that, we have to educate ourselves. \"health canada says exposure to low-level electromagnetic frequency, such as that coming from wi-fi, does not pose a danger to the public. it says energy levels emitted are limited by guidelines that were set after looking at thousands of peer-reviewed studies .\" as long as the exposure is below these established limits, there is no convincing scientific evidence that this equipment is dangerous to schoolchildren or to canadians in general, \"a health canada statement says. not everyone is convinced. last summer in barrie, ont., a request was made to disconnect wi-fi in area schools after parents voiced fears that it was causing nausea and headaches in students. the board declined, saying there was no evidence indicating wi-fi caused such symptoms. in november, roots and wings montessori place in surrey banned wireless devices. citizens for safe technology is a vancouver-based group that has about a dozen active supporters in the capital region. two of them, parents tammy and rob jeske, were among the speakers who addressed the greater victoria board about wi-fi last week. the couple have two sons, aged nine and 11, in local schools. tammy jeske said there is plenty of expert opinion that indicates sources of electromagnetic frequencies such as wi-fi can pose a danger .\" i've seen it in my own children, i've seen it in myself, \"she said. like others, she said she has noticed the positive effect of removing wi-fi from her environment .\" the biggest thing for us is we weren't sleeping well. myself, it was to the point where i had to take medical leave from work because i had become so chronically fatigued. \"she said wi-fi also affected the family's immune systems and led to increased illness. last year, however, after removing wireless items from the home, her sons both earned awards for perfect school attendance, jeske said. she said members of the group are pleased that the greater victoria school district is considering the wi-fi issue .\" we think there's enough evidence to warrant precaution and to hold off on wi-fi, certainly when there's an alternative in place that's easy to use. \"jeske said the alternative is to hard-wire devices. the group is scheduled to make another presentation on wi-fi concerns to the sooke board of education on dec. 7. saanich board of education chairwoman helen parker said she expects wi-fi to be discussed in the near future. aaron gulliver, canada research chair in advanced-wireless communications at the university of victoria, said discussion of wi-fi use is a positive thing .\" here at the university, it's completely wi-fi-enabled from end-to-end on campus. we have wi-fi availability everywhere, \"he said. alex de medeiros teaches a grade 8 career/health class equiped with wi-fi laptops at gordon head school in

back to 1942 during saturday's meeting with michigan, but the game's result continued a tradition established in the last decade. the no. 8 buckeyes rolled to their seventh consecutive win over rival michigan, beating the wolverines, 37-7, and clinching a share of their sixth straight big ten title in front of 105,491 fans at ohio stadium. as part of the nike pro combat series, osu wore custom-designed uniforms to honor the 1942 national championship team. the 2010 buckeyes (11-1, 7-1) likely won't be a part of any title game, but moved a step closer toward a bcs bowl invite with their ninth win in the last 10 games against michigan (7-5, 3-5). \"it's always the same feeling,\" linebacker ross homan said. \"every time we beat michigan, it's always a great feeling and a success .\" it took the buckeye offense a quarter to warm up on a chilly columbus afternoon. after a scoreless first frame, osu exploded for 24 points in the second quarter. devin barclay opened the scoring with a 33-yard field goal to cap a 10-play, 74-yard osu drive. \"they put in some schemes that we hadn't seen before, and it took us a little while to adjust to them,\" senior offensive lineman bryant browning said. \"i thought as the game went on, our offense was more effective .\" an 18-yard punt placed the buckeyes' next possession at the michigan 35-yard line. five plays later, quarterback terrelle pryor found dane sanzenbacher for a 7-yard touchdown. michigan responded with an 80-yard drive, culminating with a 1-yard touchdown run by <mark>michael shaw</mark>, but <mark>jordan hall</mark> returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards to push the osu lead to 17-7. \"words can't explain it,\" <mark>hall</mark> said. \"i've been waiting for it so long. we're supposed to give the ball to the ref after we score, but i don't even know where i put it .\" the buckeyes then cashed in on a lost fumble by michigan running back <mark>vincent smith</mark> with a 60-yard touchdown drive. pryor connected with devier posey across the middle, and the junior receiver dove into the end zone to increase osu's advantage. pryor completed 18 of 27 passes for 219 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. posey hauled in five catches for 81 yards. turnovers hindered michigan's first-half productivity. the wolverines twice turned the ball over on downs and also lost a pair of fumbles. \"we took advantage of their turnovers,\" pryor said. \"normally if you win the turnover margin, you have a good chance of winning .\" despite outgaining the buckeyes 258-229, michigan trailed 24-7 at halftime. quarterback denard robinson, widely considered the heisman trophy favorite throughout the first half of the season, rushed for 105 yards before intermission. however, coach <mark>rich rodriguez</mark> said at halftime that the sophomore dislocated a couple of fingers on his non-throwing hand. robinson sat out michigan's final drive of the first half and much of the second half. \"it wouldn't have been much of a problem, but he likes to grip it with that hand and he couldn't get any feeling back,\" <mark>rodriguez</mark> said. \"he tried to go back in the second half but he just couldn't do it. it's unfortunate because he was playing well today .\" sophomore tate forcier, whom the buckeyes picked off four times in ann arbor, mich., in last year's matchup, took over. he threw an interception on the first play after halftime. the buckeye running game struggled before the break. dan \"boom\" herron totaled minus-1 yards on five first-half carries. his fortunes changed in the third quarter. herron scored from 32 yards out on osu's opening drive of the second half, his 11th straight game with a touchdown. \"it was a strange game offensively where we kind of led with the pass in the first half and all of a sudden we got a couple turnovers and we are looking more at leading with the run the second half,\" coach jim tressel said. \"it wasn't like all of a sudden a snowstorm came in or something. it was just that's not what we needed to do and we always talk about we do what the team needs, and first half we needed to throw it .\" michigan punter will hagerup didn't travel to columbus after being suspended for what the team called \"a violation of team rules .\" after backup punter seth broekhulzen pinned the buckeyes at their own 2-yard line, herron thundered down the sideline to the end zone. a holding call against receiver dane sanzenbacher near the end of the run turned a 98-yard touchdown into an 89-yard pickup. herron's rush tied the school record for longest play from scrimmage. gene fekete gained 89 yards on a carry against pittsburgh in 1942. \"i didn't think it was a penalty but i don't make the calls,\" sanzenbacher said. \"i wouldn't change what i did if i could do the play again, if that makes it any better. sorry to boom to steal his touchdown. i was just trying to help clear the way for him to get into the end zone .\"
