The findings demonstrated statistical superiority for investigational therapy baricitinib over adalimumab after 12 weeks based on several critical measures of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity, including ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates - composite scores that represent at least a 20 percent, 50 percent and 70 percent improvement in multiple measures of RA disease activity. Improvements in the mean number of swollen and tender joints and a reduction in pain were seen as early as week one for baricitinib versus placebo. At 52 weeks, baricitinib significantly improved all seven components of the ACR composite score compared to adalimumab, including reducing the number of tender and swollen joints, reducing patients' pain, and improving physical function. Patient-reported outcomes, including degree of tiredness and the severity and duration of morning joint stiffness, assessed daily for the first 12 weeks of the study, were all significantly improved with baricitinib compared to adalimumab. At week 52, structural changes in the joints, as measured by changes in the modified Total Sharp Score, were significantly improved for both baricitinib and adalimumab compared with placebo. Lilly and Incyte previously announced that the study met its primary objective of demonstrating superiority for baricitinib versus placebo based on ACR20 response rate after 12 weeks of treatment. \"Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong condition, but it can be managed with treatment to help control symptoms, including joint inflammation and fatigue, to slow the progression of the disease and improve a patient's quality of life,\" said <mark>Peter Taylor</mark>, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.C.P., study author and Norman Collisson chair of Musculoskeletal Sciences in the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences at the University of Oxford. \"These findings suggest that the once-daily oral drug baricitinib, if approved, could provide another treatment option for those with insufficient response to current therapy.\" RA-BEAM was a 52-week trial of 1,305 patients who had active, moderate to severe RA, despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate. Patients were randomized to placebo once daily (n = 488), baricitinib 4 mg once daily (n = 487), or adalimumab 40 mg biweekly (n = 330). All patients received background methotrexate. At week 24, patients taking placebo were crossed over to baricitinib. \"This is the first Phase 3 study showing that a once daily, oral treatment significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with injectable adalimumab for patients with active RA who were also receiving treatment with methotrexate,\" said Dr Greg van Wyk, Senior Medical Director, Lilly UK. \"Lilly is committed to improving outcomes for patients living with this chronic condition.\" Serious adverse event rates were similar for baricitinib compared with placebo and lower for adalimumab, while serious infection rates were similar across groups *. There were no cases of gastrointestinal perforations. One event of tuberculosis was reported, in the adalimumab group. Four deaths occurred, one in the placebo arm, two in the baricitinib arm and one in the adalimumab arm. Two potential opportunistic infections occurred in the baricitinib arm; neither were considered serious. Temporary interruptions in treatment due to adverse events occurred with similar frequency across treatment groups. Lilly and Incyte announced top-line results in December 2014 for the first Phase 3 trial of baricitinib, RA-BEACON, in February 2015 for the second, RA-BUILD, in September 2015 for the third, RA-BEGIN and in October 2015 for the fourth, RA-BEAM. The companies will also share detailed results from the RA-BEGIN study at the American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals annual meeting this year, and plan to submit additional detailed data from all four studies for presentation in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals in 2016. Detailed data from the long-term extension study, RA-BEYOND, will also be submitted for presentation in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals in 2016. About Baricitinib Baricitinib is the only once-daily, oral, selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor currently in late - stage clinical studies for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In December 2009, Lilly and Incyte announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialisation of baricitinib and certain follow-on compounds for patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. About Baricitinib Phase 3 Trials Lilly and Incyte conducted four Phase 3 clinical trials of baricitinib in patients with moderately - to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis to support regulatory submission in most countries. The clinical trial program includes a wide range of patients including those who are methotrexate nai\u0308ve, inadequate responders to methotrexate, inadequate responders to conventional disease - modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or inadequate responders to TNF inhibitors. Patients completing any of the five Phase 3 studies can enroll in a long-term extension study. For additional information on this clinical trial program, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.

In 1942, while testing a variety of compounds for use in a plastic rifle sight, Dr. Harry Coover a company chemist, inadvertently created cyanoacrylate, a compound later marketed as Super Glue. The material was incredibly durable but was dismissed for being too sticky. When a colleague was testing cyanoacrylate nine years later, Dr. Coover had another encounter with the material. As the colleague complained the compound ruined his equipment, Coover realized its commercial potential. Super Glue was first sold as a commercial product in 1958. The product was eventually adopted by military surgeons during the Vietnam War, who would spray it over wounds to stop bleeding instantly.

Limited economic development in the country has lead to a low standard of living. Less than 20% of the population has access to electricity, and about 39% are undernourished. The government, which ranks among the most corrupt in the world, spends relatively little on education as a share of GDP, and illiteracy is widespread.

Just off Bonneville Dam, the Corps used Bradford Island for dumping, painting, sandblasting, pistol practice and other polluting activities from the 1940s into the 1980s, and dumped electrical equipment and even light bulbs into the mighty Columbia. The toxic legacy left by these decades of poor stewardship is still abundant today, contaminating the river waters and the fish that swim in them. Although the Corps since the 1990s has been responsible for evaluating and cleaning up this mess, the process has been inexcusably slow. In a letter last month, nine environmental advocacy nonprofits charge that the Corps has not conducted any cleanup since 2007, and that fish caught near the island \"contain the highest levels of cancer-causing PCBs in the Northwest.\" Lead, mercury, pesticides and petroleum byproducts also pollute the area. Aside from dredging and removal of dumped transformers in 2007, the Corps has done little besides catalog the damage and requested no money in President Donald Trump's 2020 budget to clean up this section of Washington's signature river. Better leadership must be put into place. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is unwilling to take seriously the need to clean up Bradford Island and get the contamination out of the nearby population of bass and clams, the task should be designated for Superfund cleanup. Bradford Island has never been a Superfund site, but the EPA is still adding new pollution cleanup sites to that list even under Trump. Of the 1,335 sites listed nationally as Superfunds as of this month, Washington has 48. Because it straddles the Washington-Oregon border, Bradford Island would become Oregon's 14th site. Assigning the job to the EPA would take the cleanup out of the hands of the Corps, the agency which dumped the toxic pollution and has shirked its duty to make things right.

There must be accountability for this failing. Governments of Washington, Oregon and the Yakama Nation wrote in a letter to the EPA in October that the \"serious threat to human health and the environment\" requires stronger intervention. It's time to get serious about cleaning up Bradford Island and its stretch of the Columbia River. Corps officials said it \"continues to work with state and tribal health agencies to inform area subsistence fishers and recreational anglers about the danger of eating fish that may be contaminated.\" Not good enough. That must not be the last feckless word on this historic neglect. The Seattle Times editorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.

Jonathon Niese (3-2) allowed five hits and a pair of unearned runs over seven innings. Niese had six strikeouts to gain his 10th career win against the Phillies, the most he's had against any club. His single led to Lagares' blast to left on a 1-0 pitch. \"Juan had a great hit there and our defense played outstanding,\" Niese said. Ruben Tejada had a pair of hits and scored once for the Mets, who bounced back from a 3-1 loss Friday to win for the third time in four games. Aaron Harang (3-3), pitching on his 37th birthday, gave up Lagares' first homer of the year. Harang surrendered eight hits over his seven-inning effort. <mark>Carlos Ruiz</mark> doubled in one run, but with the tying run at third in the eighth, he hit a sharp grounder to Tejada at shortstop. That started the inning-ending 6-4-3 double play. \"It was set up, but I thought the shortstop made a good play on Chooch's ball hit hard to the backhand,\" Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg said. New York used three pitchers in that eighth inning. Freddy Galvis doubled off <mark>Carlos Torres</mark> to begin the frame. With one out, Alex Torres came in, but of his nine pitches thrown, eight were balls in walks to pinch-hitter Grady Sizemore and <mark>Cesar Hernandez</mark>. Carlyle then put out the fire when he faced <mark>Ruiz</mark>. Chase Utley ended an 0-for-19 stretch with a pinch-hit single to right field with one out in the home ninth against Jeurys Familia. Pinch-hitter Ryan Howard then flied out to center and Ben Revere hit a slow bouncer toward first and was tagged out to give Familia his 12th save. <mark>Cesar Hernandez</mark> was unable to handle Lucas Duda's bouncer in the fifth, and that scored Tejada with the first run. Revere scored on Jeff Francoeur's sacrifice fly in the sixth.

file photo gisele bundchen has made it clear that if you are messing with husband <mark>tom brady</mark>, you are also messing with her - and that won't be pleasant. throughout my life, i have been constantly lectured by friends and foes alike about my cluelessness regarding two subjects in particular. one, i don't understand football. two, i don't understand women. rarely have these two blind sports come into confluence as they did last week, when gisele bundchen launched her campaign to be hired as receivers coach for the new england patriots. heckled by new york giants fans after a crushing super bowl defeat, mrs. <mark>tom brady</mark> responded by pointing out that her husband cannot throw and catch the ball at the same time. i do not defend heckler, ever. still, bundchen's expletive-laced indictment of the receivers, whose dropped passes sabotaged the patriots' last-minute drive, made life harder and not easier for her <mark>tom</mark>. like all good quarterbacks, <mark>brady</mark> nurtures his relationship with the men who catch his bullet-like throws. here's a guy who said defended <mark>randy moss</mark> and said nice things about chad ochocinco, for cryin' out loud. it gets no easier when the wife starts cryin' out loud or assigning blame. or so i thought. \"i feel sorry for gisele,\" a woman in the bank told me. after i had picked myself off the floor and stopped laughing, i asked why. she's being criticized for defending her husband. what's wrong with that? \"point taken, i said. i left for the office, wondering if that opinion represented a minority of one. not hardly, as the kids say.\" i don't care what anyone says. i'm defending gisele, \"said a woman who knows her football better than i do, and almost as well as gisele thinks she does. i have conferred with a few other women how they felt about bundchen's outburst. it's not unanimous, but evidently, a percentage of american femininity is standing by gisele for standing by her man. they all refer to her by her first name, suggesting a bond that should not be challenged. a common response begins with,\" i don't care what anyone says. \"i interpreted\" anyone, \"to mean\" me, \"or anyone unfortunate enough to share my gender. this has caused me to reassess the entire bundchen controversy. having lived through the women's liberation movement and changing attitudes of american culture, i realized bundchen represents something to all of us. to the modern woman, she is far from your everyday trophy wife. she is a bright, involved and feisty marriage partner, and very much her own person. to the more old-fashioned crowd, she is tammy wynette, crooning\" stand by your man, \"while the gloria steinems of the world cringe. american men, i would guess, are fairly united in their belief that bundchen should have kept her mouth shut. that i what many american men think all women, especially wives, should do. american women are tired of that. they probably figure if <mark>terry bradshaw</mark> can bray into the microphone and be passed off as a football analyst, anybody can do it. i think bundchen was a little harsh with the receivers. wes welker in particular has received too much blame for failing to haul in a pretty difficult catch. even so, i am willing to re-examine my initial reaction that bundchen was out of bounds by trashing her husband's own receivers. this could usher in an entirely new form of nfl analysis. instead of sending it back to the studio at halftime, we could send it up to the luxury boxes. there, the wives could break down the game with a candor we don't get from the clowns in the booth. until that day comes, i have to admire <mark>tom brady</mark>. sure, his wife is gorgeous, but she is also incredibly loyal. she is certainly no mrs. fritz peterson or mrs. mike kekick of 1972. those were the wives of new york yankees pitcher who were swapped by their husbands, at a time society still thought that was strange. not gisele. had the patriots done protected <mark>brady</mark> with the gusto she has shown in doing so, he probably would have won the game. i suspect we will not hear from bundchen for some time, but i hope we do. i'd like to hear her thoughts on shoring up that defensive secondary. none of the men seem to know how to do it."}, {"articleID": "2009010709_00013557_W", "names": {"Gordon Brown":
