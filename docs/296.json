[{"date": "2015-03-31", "url": "http://www.sys-con.com/node/3318741", "content": "Mike Kavis News Feed Item Oxysure (OXYS) Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2014 Results FRISCO, TX--(Marketwired - March 31, 2015) - OxySure Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: OXYS) (\"OxySure,\" or the \"Company\" ), today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues were $2.4 million, up 35%, led by an 83% increase in revenues in the US Model 615 shipments up 18%; Replacement cartridge shipments up 35% Replacement cartridges up to 144% of Model 615 shipped Julian T. Ross, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of OxySure stated, \"We are pleased to have grown the business once again, while remaining focused on building a solid medical device platform to leverage growth opportunities going forward. We are now remarkably well-positioned as an emerging medical device leader to achieve our goals for 2015 and beyond. These goals include rapidly growing our direct sales force, expanding overseas, launching a direct to consumer (DTC) campaign, uplisting our company to NYSE or Nasdaq, and making strategic acquisitions .\" For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, revenues increased by 35% to $2,437,402 from $1,800,327 in 2013. The increase was primarily driven by an 83% surge in revenues in the United States. The revenue increase in the US was driven primarily by an increase in sales from products for the military in connection with a teaming agreement. For the Company's Model 615 portable emergency oxygen product, unit cartridge reorder rates continued to increase as the installed base of Model 615 increases, continuing the trend of a very \"sticky\" customer relationship with the product upon adoption. Unit cartridge shipments as a percentage of Model 615 shipments increased to 144% in FY2014 from 125% in FY2013. Cartridges as a percentage of the Model 615 installed base as at December 31, 2014 increased to 45%, up from 39.3% as at December 31, 2013. During FY2014, Model 615 shipments increased 18% versus FY2013, and replacement cartridge shipments increased 35% versus FY2013. This continues to be consistent with historical trends of rising reorders as customers become more accustomed to OxySure's products. Gross profit was $1,018,355 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 15.7% from $1,207,341, primarily due to the effect of an increase in absorbed rent expense and labor cost. Adjusted for these rent and labor expenses gross profit was $1,352,746 representing a gross margin of 56%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2014 were $2,469,711 compared to $1,339,624 for fiscal year 2013. The Company increased sales and marketing expenses by 104% to $718,705 as it expanded its sales and marketing, branding and investor relations efforts. General and administrative expenses also increased by 78% to $1,751,006 primarily as a result of an increase in employee stock option expense, an increase in salaries and wages, and an increase in professional fees. Professional fees increased primarily due to legal and accounting fees related to an acquisition transaction the Company pursued during the second half of 2014 but did not consummate during FY2014. Interest expense increased to approximately $907,612 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $249,979 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the amortization of debt discount and beneficial conversion features (BCF). The Company recorded approximately $747,612 in non-cash interest related to debt discount amortization during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $207,239 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Net loss during fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was $2,753,560, or $0.10 per share, as compared to $712,452 or $0.03 per share for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. The weighted average shares outstanding were 26,367,254 and 23,754,402 for fiscal year 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company's balance sheet remained strong. Cash was $647,093 at December 31, 2014 as compared to $657,673 at December 31, 2013. Working capital was a surplus of $418,734 at December 31, 2014 as compared to a surplus of $747,473 at December 31, 2013. The Company's current ratio was 1.3 as at December 31, 2014. Cash from financing activities was down 24% to $1.16 million during FY2014 from $1.52 million during FY2013. The Company had deferred income tax assets of $5,588,365 and $4,733,483 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively which were offset in full by a valuation allowance. OxySure enters 2015 in a remarkably strong position as an emerging medical device leader. Over the past 12 months, the Company: Expanded its international distribution footprint by adding new distributors such as HTM Medico for Singapore, and Ajad Medical for Saudi Arabia; Received CE Mark Approval for the OxySure Model 615 Portable Emergency Oxygen Device, a critical step toward launching the product into the 30 countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA); Commenced a pilot for a cloud-based tracking and incident reporting system; Made significant progress on the development of new products for the military; Secured Cliff Meidl, two-time Olympian and Team USA Olympic Flag Bearer to be a Spokesman and Special Advisor exclusively to the Company; Was selected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as one of 10 companies, including Caterpillar, Qualcomm and others to exhibit its product and related technologies at the Innovation Expo held at the Smithsonian; Made significant staffing additions to enhance medical device platform capability, including a VP of Resuscitation Sales, Director of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance, and additions in engineering, manufacturing and territory sales management; and Opportunistically invested in operational efficiencies. The Company plans to continue its focus on growth by expanding its direct sales force and its global distribution channel. The Company also plans to ramp up its sales and marketing activities to raise market awareness and grow its brand, while maintaining a focus on regulatory approvals and compliance and reductions in product costs and operational costs. These initiatives and investments will result in higher sales for OxySure in the future, and at the same time expand OxySure's leadership position in the emergency/short-duration oxygen market and the pre-hospital medical emergency market in general. \"We are excited about 2015 as we anticipate continued growth, new opportunities and even the possibility of catalytic events,\" said Mr. Ross. \"We plan to continue to work hard to improve our products, our competitive position, and our category leadership, while striving to maintain our culture of innovation as we grow .\" OxySure's CEO Julian Ross will host the conference call to discuss the Company's fiscal year 2014 results.

The first half of the band's outdoor performance, which included \"Panama\" and \"Runnin' with the Devil,\" was broadcast Monday night (and shared on GuitarWorld.com Tuesday). Last night, the show broadcast several more tunes from the event, including \"Hot for Teacher,\" \"Eruption\" and the Kinks' \"You Really Got Me .\" You can watch these last three songs in the pro-shot videos below. Some of you might notice that David Lee Roth is wearing a bandage on his nose. \"They opened with\" Panama,' but during <mark>Dave</mark>'s microphone-stand ninja moves, he cut his nose, \"says Andy Alt of Los Angeles, who was at the show .\" You can see he's dealing with it in some of the fan-shot videos-until he realizes they needed a bandage to stop the bleeding. \"It was a live taping, so Roth announced they needed to start over. However, it appears Roth didn't tell Eddie [Van Halen] that he was stepping off stage, so Eddie performed an impromptu guitar solo, which was cool and unexpected.

Your weather is set to STATE COLLEGE--It really wasn't all that long ago, the spring of 2013, that <mark>Trevor Williams</mark> was new to defense at the college level, new to corner, and eventually the target of opposing passing attacks come that fall. The Baltimore native came to Penn State as a receiver, catching 10 passes as a freshman and returning four kicks. Then, in his second spring in blue and white, he stopped being a receiver and starter defending them. His first season was up and down; by mid-year, he was no longer a starter. That rough patch is far in the rear view mirror, though. Come August, and Penn State's season-opener against Temple, the rangy defensive back is set to begin his second straight season as a starting cornerback in Bob Shoop's defense. \"It's just been a learning experience; not getting down on myself, talking to guys from the previous teams,\" <mark>Williams</mark> said Wednesday. \"Adrian Amos [was] definitely like a big brother to me, and just working hard on the field and off the field has helped me out a lot .\" <mark>Williams</mark>, who has put on 10 pounds of muscle this winter and now stands 6-foot-1, 196 pounds, had to work hard to get on the field in his first year on defense, at least after Penn State was blown out at Ohio State two years ago. The following week, Amos moved up to corner, and Stephen Obeng-Agyapong, who played just about every where that season, slid back from linebacker to safety. The moment was likely shocking for <mark>Williams</mark>, then a sophomore, but now is merely a blip on his career's radar. <mark>Williams</mark> made 12 starts a year ago (he missed the Temple game), finishing with 27 tackles and two interceptions playing opposite Jordan Lucas. It was a successful season, but as <mark>Williams</mark>' career arc shows, change is possible in any college football program regardless of results. He and Lucas made a dynamic pair, but now the latter is back at safety (replacing Amos, of course), meaning <mark>Williams</mark> will likely play opposite a different corner for the third straight year. \"Grant Haley, he's stepped up this spring, he's doing a lot of great things,\" <mark>Williams</mark> said when asked about the contenders for Lucas' old job. \"Daquan Worley, he's showing some improvement; a lot of the young guys, <mark>Christian Campbell</mark>, <mark>Jordan Smith</mark>, Daquan Davis, the whole secondary room, we're working together, and [corners] Coach [Terry] <mark>Smith</mark> has been helping us out a lot .\" The group vying for snaps at corner is long, and also inexperienced. Haley saw the most snaps of anyone hoping to start a year ago, but head coach <mark>James Franklin</mark> has pointed out Worley's and <mark>Campbell</mark>'s performances this spring. <mark>Smith</mark> and Davis are veterans who have played sparingly on defense during their time in blue and white. Older players, like Amos, helped <mark>Williams</mark> anyway they could, and he's hoping to return the favor. He knows a thing or two about bumpy roads and competition leading to quality production, and if he can use his past hardship to make the starters and contributors on the opposite side of the field from him better, Penn State's defense has a chance to be better, too. h1> \"Nittany Insider' Get the latest in Penn State sports in your inbox daily from PennLive.com.
