The move came after <mark>Stephen Kelly</mark> stood down from the top job in August. As of 10:22 GMT, Sage's share price had added 3.02 percent to 566.60 p, outperforming the broader UK market, with the benchmark FTSE 100 index currently standing 0.67 percent higher at 7,162.02 points. The group's shares have given up just under 24 percent of their value over the past year, as compared with about a five-percent drop in the Footsie. Sage appoints new CEO The Sage Group announced in a statement this morning that it had appointed Steve Hare to the role of Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect. Hare joined the board in January 2014 as the group's finance chief, and was subsequently appointed to the additional post of interim chief executive officer on August 31, following the departure of outgoing CEO <mark>Stephen Kelly</mark>. The software group's chairman Donald Brydon commented that Hare had \"impressed the Board with the momentum, focus and clarity he has brought to the organisation over the last few months as COO but also throughout his tenure as CFO\". The Sage Group said that it had started a process to find new finance chief, with Hare to combine his CEO and CFO duties until an appointment was made. Analysts weigh in on move \"We welcome Mr. Hare's appointment as CEO and believe the shares will react positively to the news,\" analysts at Shore Capital commented in a note, as quoted by Proactive Investors, adding that in their view, the group was \"now unlikely to make any radical departures from the current strategy, as some had speculated, as Mr. Hare has been central to the current direction of travel\" ."}, {"articleID": "2016091511_00063250_W", "names": {"Colin Powell": ["Q150851", "Q5145485"]}, "date": "2016-09-15", "url": "http://4029tv.com/national/urgent-russia-says-us-not-fulfilling-syria-ceasefire-obligations/41676220", "content": "Text Size: ASmall Text AMedium Text ALarge Text (CNN)--Russia's Defense Ministry said Thursday that the US is not fulfilling its obligations under the Syrian ceasefire agreement, while denying accusations that its own forces have violated the pause in the conflict.

It was his mother telling him of his father's diagnosis. \"I had no idea what MS was, but from there on I developed an interest and decided to go into the medical side of things when I got home,\" <mark>Hammond</mark> said. <mark>Hammond</mark> went to medical school and became a neurologist so he could help his dad and many other MS sufferers. He specializes in MS and sleep disorders. \"This was the profession for me,\" he said. \"I had a lot of background and a real passion for it and because my father had MS I could relate to my patients with MS.\" <mark>Richard Hammond</mark>, 67, and a retired restaurant owner, said he is proud of his son's accomplishments. <mark>Richard</mark> began having symptoms in 1990 when his feet had the sensation of going to sleep and he was unable to move his legs. \"I was diagnosed in 1992,\" he said. \"I had an MRI done and the doctor called me on the phone and told me that he believed I had MS. He wished me good luck and told me there was nothing he could do for me .\" Things have changed since then. Today, there are 10 disease-modifying treatments that include oral drugs, intravenous medications and injections. <mark>Richard</mark> is on an oral medication that has helped keep the disease from progressing too much. \"We've made a lot of progress in understanding the disease and the immune system in regard to MS,\" said Dr. Bruce Bebo in a telephone interview from New York City. Bebo is associate vice president of Discovery Research at the National MS Society. \"The lives of people living with MS have been greatly improved through these treatments .\" MS is a chronic disease that attacks the body's central nervous system, Chris Hammond said. Approximately 400,000 Americans suffer from the disease. Symptoms vary and can be as individual as the person who has the illness, but there are some commonalities. \"Most people with MS have fatigue, heat intolerance and cognitive concerns,\" <mark>Hammond</mark> said. \"Some people have numbness and tingling, balance problems, ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) and vision, sleep and bladder problems .\" A lot of research is being done on the disease. Last week, researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School said they now suspect much of the investigation into MS has focused on the wrong part of the brain and say until now, research has been done on the brain's white matter. But the new study found gray matter is far more affected by the disease. <mark>Hammond</mark> said he is confident there will one day either be a complete cure for MS or a highly effective way to manage it even better. \"We've had some early success with T-cell vaccination and there's a lot of work being done in stem cell research, he said.

despite the encouragement of many to stay in power. despite the willingness of americans to crown him king. in 1787, washington was coaxed back to philadelphia to attend the constitutional convention. while there he provided the leadership necessary to get the fractious delegates to settle down and complete the work of designing a new constitution. afterwards, in 1789, he was elected the first president of the united states. he reluctantly ran for a second term in 1792. he refused to run for a third term, setting a precedent that lasted 150 years, and retired once again to his farm. abraham lincoln said, \"if you want to test a man's character -

And if you think you've seen conflicting studies on whether salt is killing you, you're not imagining things. Researchers reviewing over 35 years of academic reports and studies said Thursday that the community of scientists studying salt intake among humans is sharply divided, and unlikely to come to any definitive conclusions soon. While the scientific literature is slightly in favor of people reducing salt intake--around 54 percent of reports said humans would probably be healthier if we did--another third said it may not matter, while a handful more were inconclusive, researchers said. Worse, they found that the scientists who disagree hardly ever collaborate, instead citing papers that tend to square with their point of view. Much of the research also had a strong bias toward the status quo. \"There are two almost distinct bodies of scholarship--one supporting and one opposing the claim that salt reduction in populations will improve clinical outcomes,\" says <mark>David Johns</mark>, who co-authored an article outlining the findings in the International Journal of Epidemiology. \"Each is driven by a few prolific authors who tend to cite other researchers who share their point of view, with little apparent collaboration between the two sides .\" Scientists also can't agree on what counts as evidence, while a number of the observational studies were hurt by methodological defects. In other words, the jury's still out on salt, and we probably shouldn't expect a definitive answer anytime soon. \"We pay quite a bit of attention to financial bias in our work,\" says <mark>Sandro Galea</mark>, another article co-author. \"We seldom pay attention, however, to how long-held beliefs bias the questions we ask and the results we publish, even as new data become available .\" "}, {"articleID": "2014032909_00035534_W", "names": {"Jimmie Johnson": ["Q217238", "Q6199355"], "Joe Gibbs": ["Q1254455", "Q22959236", "Q2331580", "Q25713948"]}, "date": "2014-03-29", "url": "http://ohio.com/sports/motorsports/nascar-kyle-busch-wins-pole-at-martinsville-speedway-1.476821", "content": "MARTINSVILLE, Va.: Kyle Busch has seen it time and again at Martinsville Speedway. Driving down pit road, heading back onto the track and in contention for the lead, Busch is used to seeing the pole-sitter gun the engine just off the jack and reassume the race lead. Busch hopes to finally get to experience that for himself at Martinsville Speedway on Sunday after earning the pole on NASCAR's smallest, tightest track for the first time in 19 career starts. \"I think that's a great thing for us,\" Busch said after winning the pole with a lap at 99.674 mph. \"We get to pit there and of course drop the jack and just lunge across the line and be good .\" You need to still run up front all day. I think that it's a great opportunity for us to pick up some spots say if we're second, third, fourth, whatever, but you definitely always want to stay as close to the front as you can and try not to use that box as much as some guys have in the past. \"The pole is the 14th of Busch's career. In an interesting twist under NASCAR's new knockout qualifying system, Busch won it while Joey Logano set a track record. That came at 100.201 mph during the first phase of two-session qualifying. All 44 cars competed in the 30-minute first session, and the top 12 moved into the 10-minute phase two. Denny Hamlin earned the No. 2 starting spot with a lap at 99.548 mph, and will be followed on the starting grid by Logano and Hendrick Motorsports teammates <mark>Jimmie Johnson</mark> and Jeff Gordon. That puts Busch in some pretty accomplished company because Hamlin (4), <mark>Johnson</mark> and Gordon (8 each) have won a lot. Busch, though, is coming off a victory last week at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif., and while he said it wasn't dominating, it gave him hope that the <mark>Joe Gibbs</mark> Racing teams are coming together .\" It just seems to be working well right now, whatever is working, \"he said. Hamlin, who promised earlier in the day that he would win on Sunday, wasn't in love with the outside starting spot because it can be tricky to get down to the bottom on restarts from the outside. He said nothing that happened in practice or qualifying made him change his view of how it can all unfold .\" I knew, even going into this weekend, I knew we were going to be really good contenders and be in the mix anyway, \"he said .\" I feel like after running a couple laps of practice I felt like this was a car that was capable of winning. I think with tire management being more of a factor than it's ever been, it kind of lends itself to my driving style even more. For that reason I think we'll be tough on Sunday. \"Logano has two top-10 finishes on the 0.526-mile oval, but none since 2010 .\" So we've got a track record, but we don't have a pole. How does that work? \"he asked. A solid pit position, he said, could help turns things around on Sunday .\" Obviously, the pit stall is very important, especially here. It's a dangerous pit road, so you want to get a nice spot you can get in and out of, but obviously here it's a slow pit road and you can make up a lot with timing lines on pit road, \"he said. Danica Patrick qualified 10th, her best starting spot in a race not held at Daytona. Her previous best starting position was 21st, accomplished twice last season. Hamlin returns Being told he couldn't race last weekend because of an eye and vision problem will not make Hamlin less likely to seek the help of medical staffs available at NASCAR tracks every weekend, he said Friday. Hamlin let Sam Hornish Jr. drive his car last weekend at Auto Club Speedway after he sought the assistance of the on-site medical team when his face swelled up and his vision blurred. Initially thought to be a sinus infection, it turned out to be a small piece of metal in his eye, Hamlin said at Martinsville Speedway. Hamlin said he doesn't blame the two doctors who examined him for failing to see the rusting metal, and it wasn't until he saw an optometrist that it was discovered, removed, and he started feeling better .\" It took someone who was in the business of eyes to find it, \"he said. Hamlin was cleared to return this weekend and he took umbrage at the notion that his reputation might have been tarnished when he missed the race .\" People who think negatively of me or think that we side-stepped some sort of drug test or something is ridiculous, \"he said, adding that he was making an effort not to get angry at the suggestion that something untoward was afoot .\" I'm in one of the top-three cars in NASCAR. I would have to be an absolute moron - moron - to risk that. \"Dale Earnhardt Jr., who originally said he was concerned about Hamlin's point of view about how he wound up being told he couldn't race, said his concern wasn't for the medical team's competency, but for his fellow driver .\" I feel great about the process and what NASCAR has had in place for years, \"Earnhardt said."}, {"articleID": "2015021318_00015677_W", "names": {"Todd Richards": ["Q2438502", "Q7812590"]}, "date": "2015-02-13", "url": "http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=753226&cmpid=rss-mixer", "content": "Notebook: Wisniewski returns, top line reunited vs. Flyers With both teams in similar situations, Blue Jackets coach <mark>Todd Richards</mark> said it's not hard to predict what type of game will be played tonight against the Philadelphia Flyers. will be honored with a pre-game ceremony celebrating his 1,000 th career game, which was Monday night against the Los Angeles Kings. The NHL will present Hartnell with a silver stick to commemorate the milestone, and the Blue Jackets will have a presentation, as well - but <mark>Richards</mark> said once the ceremony is over, his team must be ready to play against a team that's also desperate for points. \"We can't get caught up in the ceremony and what's going on,\" <mark>Richards</mark> said. \"It's great to honor (Hartnell), but once that ends, we have a job to do and we have to be ready for the start of the game. There's lots of former teammates (on both sides), the trades, ceremony, both teams desperate for points and they're Philadelphia, too. The Blue Jackets are about to embark on a stretch in which they play 11 games in 19 days, including a five-game trip through the Eastern Conference that includes four games against teams in the Metropolitan Division. But regardless of who they're playing and what the situation is, the Blue Jackets don't have a choice but to approach each game the same way and try to rack up points .\" Nothing changes from what I've said a week, two weeks, three weeks ago - it doesn't matter who we're playing, it's two points and we have to go out and get two points, \"<mark>Richards</mark> said .\" We have to win as many games as we possibly can; it doesn't matter if we're playing the LA Kings, Philadelphia, the Islanders...we're going to face some really good teams in tough environments because we're going on the road. To me, every game is just as critical as any other game. \"RETURN OF THE WIZ After missing the previous two games with a lower body injury, will return to the lineup tonight and give the Blue Jackets a boost on the back end. It's been a freakish stretch for Columbus on the blue line, going from having nine healthy defensemen when the sun came up last Friday to then having only six on Sunday morning. and Wisniewski to injuries a week ago against St. Louis, and then, suffered an upper body injury Saturday in Ottawa. Prout won't play tonight but he's not far off, and Wisniewski will certainly aid the Blue Jackets' power play which has scored one goal in its last 19 chances, but has only had five man advantage opportunities in the last four games. gets the call in goal tonight, his 50th appearance as a Blue Jacket after signing as a free agent two seasons ago. McElhinney is 6-3-0 in his last nine starts and is coming off a 40-save performance in defeat Monday night against the Kings, but prior to that, he was very strong in back-to-back wins over the Blues and Senators .\" Sometimes you're thrust into that role and that's just the circumstances, \"<mark>Richards</mark> said .\" He's done a good job for us, and he had a tough stretch (earlier in the season) just like everyone has tough stretches as players. I think he's responded, he's rebounded and he's back at that level where he's winning games or he's giving us a chance to win games. \"It was no different against LA on Monday - I know we gave up four goals but a couple of them were just slam-dunks or tap-in goals into empty nets because we didn't do the job around him .\" NHL.COM NEWS Friday, 02.13.2015 / 12:30 PM By Kinsey Janke Friday, 02.13.2015 / 3:00 AM"}]
