He began his career at his father Francois Pinault's company Pinault Distribution, which later became PPR and then Kering, in 1987 and is now its chairman and chief executive. Under his leadership the group sold off its retail assets including La Redoute and Printemps and merged with the Gucci Group, which oversees luxury brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and <mark>Alexander McQueen</mark>, to become one of the biggest players in high-end fashion. Francois-Henri Pinault and Salma Hayek attending the British Fashion Awards in 2015 (Ian West/PA) He changed the name of the group from PPR to Kering in 2013 in reference to his Breton roots. Mr Pinault, 56, has been president of his family's investment firm, Groupe Artemis, since 2003, and it is this group that will donate funds to help restore Notre Dame Cathedral after it was devastated by fire. In a statement obtained by French newspaper Le Figaro, he said: \"My father (Francois Pinault) and myself have decided to release a sum of 100 million euro from our Artemis funds (the family holding company) to participate in the effort that will be necessary for the complete reconstruction of Notre Dame .\" Mr Pinault married Hayek in Paris in 2009 and the couple have an 11-year-old daughter named Valentina.

Matthew Eaton, of Caloundra, had a near miss earlier this year, just 2km away from where Mr Frewer was killed Monday morning. Mr Eaton was turning right from Ivadale Blvd about 8am on April 17 when he was taken out by a driver who he said was not paying attention. \"I signalled and I had bike lights and everything,\" he said. \"After entering the roundabout...a car came up continuing on Parklands Blvd and didn't see me, and took me out from behind .\" He sustained a bad elbow injury with soft tissue and bone bruising, severe gravel rash to his back and legs, and whiplash in his back. Mr Eaton said the Sunshine Coast had \"amazing\" infrastructure for both cyclists and drivers, and the biggest issue with road incidents was driver inattention. \"I commuted every day in Sydney for five years...never had an accident,\" he said. \"It was sort of funny to come up here where there was a lot more space, and then suddenly there's an accident .\" The Sunshine Coast is really well set up for cycling. The shoulders of the roads are huge, there's usually a lot of space at intersections, there's lots of cycle lanes. \"But in a way, that almost breathes a bit of complacency amongst a lot of people, drivers and cyclists included .\" Mr Eaton is one of many cyclists who have saught legal advice from Shine Lawyers over incidents on Sunshine Coast roads. Cam Frewer has created a facebook page to educate drivers about cyclists on the roads and he has received death threats for his efforts. John McCutcheon While Mr Eaton didn't know safety advocate Cameron Frewer personally, he had read about his campaign efforts online. \"He was quite well known,\" he said. Mr Eaton said while there were \"bullies\" on the roads, they weren't the issue when it came to cyclist safety. To continue Mr Frewer's cyclist safety legacy, Mr Eaton said drivers needed to be educated on road sharing rules and be more attentive. \"They (bullies) are out there, and they intimidate you and they yell things and drive particularly close, but in actual fact I don't think they're the ones who are the most dangerous, because they're so attentive of you,\" he said. \"They see you and they try to annoy you, and they know you're there .\" In my accident it was just a normal, middle-aged lady who wasn't paying attention. \"Matthew Eaton had a near miss earlier this year. A long-running feud between drivers and cyclists on the Sunshine Coast has reignited in the wake of Mr Frewer's death. Mr Eaton said if each side could see the other's point of view, it would make a huge difference .\" I think every driver needs to ride a bike at one point, \"he said .\" If you got every person who drives a car just to ride a bike once on the road...that would make them understand. \"For cyclists to feel safe riding on public roads, Mr Eaton said all road users needed to be mindful and respectful of each other .\" At the end of the day, you're completely trusting people in vehicles...that they're going to see you and they're going to be attentive of you, \"he said .\" There's a lot of trust involved. \"Related Items premium_icon\" Cyclists are human beings': Lawyer's plea to drivers 0 caloundra Read More Login to follow cameron frewer Read More Login to follow cycling Read More Login to follow cyclist safety Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow little mountain Read More Login to follow motoring Read More Login to follow road safety Read More Login to follow caloundra cameron frewer cycling cyclist safety editors picks little mountain motoring road safety"}, {"articleID": "2010031119_00019379_W", "names": {"David Smith": ["Q1176671", "Q1176674", "Q16194812", "Q16201315", "Q1916387", "Q1951382", "Q21165896", "Q21453047", "Q25184192", "Q25397428", "Q26848960", "Q28855433", "Q3018800", "Q3369644", "Q3527050", "Q39620757", "Q42761997", "Q42793405", "Q43240849", "Q43914056", "Q47451204", "Q50098593", "Q5229871", "Q5230807", "Q5231728", "Q5239876", "Q5239878", "Q5239879", "Q5239882", "Q5239883", "Q5239884", "Q5239886", "Q5239887", "Q5239888", "Q5239889", "Q5239891", "Q5239892", "Q5239893", "Q5239895", "Q5239896", "Q5239899", "Q5239900", "Q5239901", "Q5239902", "Q5239903", "Q5239904", "Q5239905", "Q5239906", "Q5239907", "Q5239908", "Q5239909", "Q53960880", "Q55965901", "Q57053421", "Q902736"]}, "date": "2010-03-11", "url": "http://fayobserver.com/Articles/2010/03/11/982685", "content": "what email address would you like us to send it to?

There are plans to develop Werribee into a major city centre with high rise towers. Could this be the beginning of high rise living in Werribee? A double-block site, zoned to host a seven level apartment block, is piquing the interest of developers in Melbourne's outer west. If permits were issued, it would be the tallest residential apartment tower built in Werribee. The tallest building is currently a four storey serviced apartment block on Synnot Street in Werribee's town centre. The two properties at 41 and 43 Cottrell Street recently came on the market following the 2014 death of local identity and pharmacist Hinton Lowe, who owned one of the homes. Mr Lowe's neighbours saw the appeal of combining the site, after the area was re-zoned from residential to commercial use as a part of Werribee's Activity Centre Boundary. The land has been earmarked for mixed-use city development, with both state and local government encouraging higher density development in the area. Wyndham City Council has fast - racked the planning process, allowing potential developers to apply for permits along the area online. Domain understand there is currently one application for a seven level commercial building currently before the council. Wyndham Mayor Cr Peter Maynard said while nothing had yet been approved, high density living in the area had been welcomed by most residents. \"There is certainly a need for options for people, and we will try to tailor them to suit what we need,\" Cr Maynard said. The activity centre borders the 775 hectare old State Research Farm area in East Werribee, which the state government is currently reviewing tenders for. One of the bids included plans for 50-level skyscrapers amongst Melbourne's newest major education and employment hubs. Werribee City Centre and East Werribee are earmarked for enormous expansion and mixed-use city development. Photo: Wyndham City Council Brian Mark Real Estate agent <mark>Stephen Murphy</mark>, who is listing the sale of the Cottrell Street site via private treaty, said he had received significant interest in the site, particularly from overseas investors. \"We've spoken to developers from Indonesia and China, as well as a few local people,\" Mr <mark>Murphy</mark> said. Plans for the site will have to include commercial street frontage--such as ground floor offices, a restaurant or retail businesses--but can have apartments behind that frontage and on the upper floors, to a height of seven levels. The plans will see Mr Lowe's architectually-designed estate, at number 41, demolished. It had been crafted by well-known Melbourne architect <mark>Peter McIntyre</mark>, whose major projects include Melbourne's Parliament Station, The Jam Factory and the 1952 Melbourne Olympic Swimming Pool.

Study Finds Cats Can Catch COVID-19 By Neil P. (staff @ latinpost.com) First Posted: Apr 09, 2020 08:43 AM EDT Share This Tweet This Close Share This Tweet This (Photo: Pexels) A recently published study in the Journal of Science confirms that COVID-19 can infect cats, and this has now prompted the World Health Organization to have a further look at the study. COVID-19 TRANSMISSION COVID-19 that originated in Wuhan, China, is thought to be transmitted by persons to other persons through droplets. It is for this reason that social distancing, stay-at-home policy, and other strict measures are implemented across the globe to control the spread of the virus. Now, there are more than 1.5 million of COVID-19 cases around the globe and a death toll of more than 88,000 according to worldometers. These numbers are expected to increase or will reach its peak once there is mass testing for COVID-19. The transmission of COVID-19 from persons-to-persons has been scientifically established. It is the reason why almost 30 pharmaceutical companies are on the race of developing a vaccine that will kill the virus and treat the patients. CATS CAN CATCH THE VIRUS Recent research published in the Journal of Science states that COVID-19 can infect cats, but dogs and other animals like chickens, pigs, and ducks are not likely to catch the virus. The primary purpose of the study is to identify which among the animals are vulnerable for the virus so that they can use it in testing the vaccine before applying for the Phase 1 or the human clinical trial to make sure that the vaccine is safe and effective. It is believed that the virus first spread from bats to humans. Meanwhile, aside from the reports that cats and dogs can be infected with the virus, there is still no scientific and empirical evidence that pets can be carriers of the virus. In a recent report from Latin Post, a four-year-old Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19 after it was exposed to a zookeeper who was an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier. It raised the question of whether or not the virus can be transmitted from humans-to-animals. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED During the epidemic period of COVID-19 in China, they conducted a study in January and February and they found out that cats and ferrets are highly susceptible to the virus. The researchers of the said study attempted to infect the animals through viral particles via the nose. The other result of the study is that cats can transmit the virus to other cats via respiratory droplets. At the same time, these infected cats were found to have the virus in their mouth, nose, and small intestines. Daniel Kuritzkes, head of infectious diseases at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said: \"It's both interesting and not surprising in the sense that with the original SARS epidemic, civet cats were implicated as one of the vectors that may have transmitted virus to humans .\" He also added: \"What these data do provide is support for the recommendation that people who are with COVID-19 should be distancing themselves, not only from other household members but also from their household pets, so as not to transmit the virus to their pets, particularly to cats or other felines .\" WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE A FURTHER STUDY For this reason, the World Health Organization announced that they are now working with their partners to have a closer look at the study so that they will know the role of cats in this infectious and deadly disease. Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said: \"We don't believe that they are playing a role in transmission, but we think that they may be able to be infected from an infected person .\" Moreover, WHO's top emergency expert <mark>Mike Ryan</mark> is asking people not to retaliate against the animals. He said: \"They're beings in their own right and they deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. They are victims like the rest of us .\" Read a related article: First of Her Kind: Tiger at Bronx Zoo Tests Positive for COVID-19 Tags Cats, COVID-19, new study, COVID-19 infections \u00a9 2015 Latin Post.
