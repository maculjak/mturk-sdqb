One Twitter message written by the Fianna Fail politician said celebrity Kim Kardashian had a\" fat arse \", while another told how a\" black Brazilian dwarf with ginger hair \"sat beside her on a bus. Ms Clifford-Lee is a candidate in the Fingal constituency by-election which will be held on November 29, and has branded the publicity surrounding the tweets as a smear campaign. The controversial social media posts will be a headache for Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin. Wrong Attention has been drawn to the historical tweets on social media over the weekend and Ms Clifford-Lee last night apologised for any offence caused by the posts and admitted they were wrong. In July 2011, she tweeted:\" Just doing up inventory of items in my car when it was stolen by some knacker. I think I'm going to cry. \"In June the same year, she had responded to a tweet about fashion, which is now no longer available, with:\" I think some pieces are cute but others look like something from a traveller wedding. \"In October 2011, Ms Clifford-Lee tweeted:\" Was on Dublin Bus for the first time in about a year yesterday. Forgotten how much fun it is. Black Brazilian dwarf with ginger hair sat beside me. \"Then in June 2012 she wrote\" Fat arse Kardashian is in Dublin apparently with her fella. \"Ms Clifford-Lee is the Fianna Fail Seanad spokesperson on Justice and Equality, as well as Children and Youth Affairs. Her Twitter biography describes her as a solicitor, mother and feminist. Asked by the Herald for a comment on her controversial tweets, Ms Clifford-Lee issued a statement. She said the tweets referred to are from as far back as 2011 and were posted long before she became involved in electoral politics .\" I want to be absolutely clear, the tweets were wrong and I apologise for any hurt or offence caused by them, \"Ms Clifford-Lee said .\" While it does suit some people to take my tweets out of context for their own right-wing agenda, I hope that the people of Dublin Fingal will not be distracted by personal smear campaigns such as this. \"Anyone who has worked with me since my election to the Seanad three years ago can confirm the role I have played in promoting progressive policies .\" I also actively supported the marriage equality referendum and the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment, \"added Ms Clifford-Lee. She said she wants the by-election campaign to focus on\" the very real issues that people face every day \". Triggered Ms Clifford-Lee listed these as solutions to transport, housing, health, childcare, climate change and protecting communities from crime. She was elected to the Seanad in 2016 following an unsuccessful bid for a Dail seat in the same constituency in that year's general election. Ms Clifford-Lee got more than 3,300 first preference votes in 2016. Fianna Fail has high hopes she will join Dublin Fingal party colleague Darragh O'Brien in the Dail in this month's election. The by-election was triggered by former Independents4Change TD Clare Daly winning a European Parliament seat in May. There is also a by-election in Dublin Mid-West caused by former tanaiste <mark>Frances Fitzgerald</mark> becoming an MEP in the same election."}, {"articleID": "2010101501_00143441_W", "names": {"Doug Collins": ["Q18352424", "Q3162841", "Q5300375", "Q919954"]}, "date": "2010-10-15", "url": "http://slcdunk.com/2010/10/14/1751460/game-thread-phoenix-suns-utah-jazz-pre-season-game-4", "content": "very interested to see how g-money playes in the starting role tonight...fun to see jerry throw these young kids into the starting line-up to see how they react. tonight we'll get a good look at how gordon will play with the first team and how he plays with deron running the point. smell that people????

The Broncos remade the bottom of their roster with seven new players, or 13 percent of their 53-man squad. So it was a on surface-of-the-sun practice Monday--the 100 degrees marked the hottest September Colorado day ever--coach Vic Fangio began assimilating quarterback <mark>Brandon Allen</mark>, punt returner Diontae Spencer, linebacker Corey Nelson, tight end <mark>Andrew Beck</mark>, cornerbacks Duke Dawson and Devontae Harris and offensive lineman Corey Levin. \"It's actually easier to come in and learn in a game week than it is in training camp because things are paired down and dialed in more,\" said Fangio, whose team lacked quality depth throughout the preseason. \"We're not the only team that's had this roster gymnastics. It happens every year. (General manager) John (Elway) and his guys were keeping track of everyone around the league. We just felt that with each and every move it would make us better .\" In one week, the Broncos face the Oakland Raiders. It's hard to overstate the importance of starting well in the division. Anything less than 3-3 in the AFC West spells trouble. And the Broncos have dropped three straight games in Oakland, outscored 78-48. Time to microwave the development of the new guys because all contributors are needed and necessary. \"It's going to get poppin'. We have to go out there and execute,\" Pro Bowl running back Phillip Lindsay said. \"One, you can't make mistakes. Crowd noise, you have to stay tuned in. You have to make big plays, you have to hold onto the football and your defense has to create some turnovers .\" Eyes shifted to the quarterback drills because the position demands attention. <mark>Allen</mark>, wearing No. 2, is the new backup, someone who played against the Broncos in Los Angeles last month. He is not established, but was considered an upgrade over <mark>Kevin Hogan</mark>, who finished with four interceptions in the exhibition games. For <mark>Allen</mark>, the past 24 hours became a whirlwind as he was cut, claimed and cuddled up with a new playbook. \"A lot of the concepts are similar as far as terminology wise,\" said <mark>Allen</mark>, who called himself \"a good luck charm\" for quarterbacks because in his previous two stops in Jacksonville and Los Angeles the starters stayed healthy. \"A lot goes into getting ready, especially in the huddle. You want to be familiar with what you are saying. There will be a lot of extra preparation for me, but I am not new to that so I should be fine .\" So why <mark>Allen</mark>? Fangio explained the reasoning. \"He's a good athlete. Throws a good ball. We like the way he runs an offense,\" Fangio said. One player walks from parking lot to the top of the depth chart. The plan is for Spencer, pictured above, to handle punts on Monday. Fangio cited Spencer's experience and his quickness. Spencer was claimed off waivers from the Steelers after posting a 14.7 average with a long of 38 yards this summer. Spencer returned a staggering 191 punts for a 11.3 average in the past four seasons for Ottawa and Toronto. He handled nine straight in practice during media viewing with no issues. Spencer remains motivated by the murder of his father in Louisiana during his college career at McNeese State, adopting his dad's motto \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop .\" \"It's still pushes me. It always will,\" Spencer told me, before articulating what makes a good punt returner. \"The key is trusting yourself, trusting the guys that are out there blocking for you. And you have to be consistent. That's the biggest thing, putting the offense in good field position, and if you can score, it's a bonus .\" FOOTNOTES The Broncos rounded out their practice squad, adding lineman Jake Rodgers and former CSU star linebacker Josh Watson ....Linebacker Corey Nelson returns to Denver with a new number (56), and a plan to contribute right away. He told me he should be ready to go on special teams and the defense, if needed ....Receiver Emmanuel Sanders on what fans should expect from Joe Flacco this season. \"He's a baller.

Advertisement \"The investigation is being carried out with the co-operation of Russia's anti-doping agency and is in contact with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\" Cheryshev, who scored four goals in Russia's surprise run to the World Cup quarter-finals, has denied ever taking a banned substance. The investigation stems from an interview which Dmitri Cheryshev gave to Russian publication Sport Weekend during the World Cup, in which he was quoted saying his son had received an injection containing \"growth hormone\" in the run-up to the tournament to treat injury. On the eve of Russia's last-16 game against Spain, Cheryshev said: \"I have never used any prohibited substances and you don't even have to think twice about it .\" Advertisement Advertisement The Russian Football Union (RFU) said at the time that the treatment the player received had been a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection which is legal and said the journalist had incorrectly interpreted Dmitri Cheryshev's words. Cheryshev joined Valencia on loan from Villarreal in August. He scored in Russia's 2-1 win at Turkey in the UEFA Nations League last Friday. Valencia's director general Mateu Alemany said on Wednesday the club was unaware of the investigation, adding he believed the player's father had been misquoted. \"We haven't been notified about what has been published. If the player was involved in an investigation then they (the agency) should have told the club and the player,\" Alemany said. \"We have had no communication in any form, he was subject to controls at Villarreal and at the World Cup.

<mark>calvin johnson</mark> is the quietest spectacular athlete to play for the detroit lions since <mark>barry sanders</mark> played his final season a decade ago. the no. 2 pick in the nfl draft last year usually says just a few words when reporters ask him questions and rarely makes eye contact. \"i'm just quiet,\" <mark>johnson</mark> insists. \"the media can twist words even when you don't say much, and i've been burned a couple of times. it happened in college and here .\" while being understated and standoffish comes naturally, it's also a calculated move by <mark>johnson</mark> because he figures the media will leave him alone at times. clearly, <mark>johnson</mark> would rather let his skills speak for him, and the next time they'll be on display will be sunday in detroit's home opener against the green bay packers. if he plays anything like he did in last week's loss at atlanta, his game will have a lot to say. he matched a career high with seven catches and broke a personal mark with 107 yards, 38 of which came on a short crossing pattern that left the falcons in the dust. \"that play impressed me,\" teammate <mark>roy williams</mark> said. \"two guys were coming at him and he pulled away. that's awesome. you can't coach that. receivers coach shawn jefferson agrees, saying he's working with a player who physically looks like a young <mark>randy moss</mark> -

surely, stanley dunham was gazing skyward 65 years ago, on d-day. dunham, the man whom barack obama would one day call gramps, was a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the english channel with the u.s. army air forces when the invasion of normandy at last began. six weeks later, he crossed the channel, too, and followed the allied front across france. a year later, he was on track to fight in japan when the atom bomb sent him home instead. dunham, who died 17 years ago, was the kansas-born grandfather with the outsized personality who helped to fill the hole in the future president's life created by the absence of obama's kenyan father. sgt. dunham's war years have been something of a mystery, the details of dates and places lost with the passage of time. the units that he served in were unknown even to the white house. but a life-size portrait emerges from interviews and records unearthed by the associated press. on d-day, documents place him at stoney cross, england, in the 1830th ordnance supply and maintenance co., aviation. \"this was the day we had all been waiting for,\" dunham's commanding officer wrote the night of june 6 from their base near the english channel. \"planes by the hundreds took off and landed at our field from dusk until dawn .\" his company supported the 9th air force as it prepared for the assault on normandy and took part in the drive that carried the allies across france. dunham and the men of the 1830th came across six weeks after the initial normandy invasion and followed the front through france, servicing airfields known by numbers - a-2, a-44, a-71, and more - in places such as brucheville, cricqueville, st.-jean-de-daye, peray, clastres, juvincourt and saint-dizier. on this coming saturday, the 65th anniversary of d-day, obama will visit the gravesites and beaches of normandy and look out across the channel that his grandfather crossed from a staging area at southampton, england. \"i knew him when he was older,\" obama said of his grandfather in 2007. \"but i think about him now and then as he enlisted - a man of 23, fresh-faced with a wise-guy grin .\" to the 75 men of dunham's company, he was a good guy to have around. for one thing, he taught the men how to use their new gas masks. he also came up with a radio, games and books for a day room that dunham's commanding officer described as \"a swell place to spend an evening .\" and when the 1830th had a party in the gym three days after d-day, they had dunham to thank for it. on may 31, 1944, payday, dunham had taken up a collection of 35 british pounds - about $150 in today's dollars - to finance the event. he lined up a convoy of girls from southampton who, the men hoped, would be \"simply smashing,\" as his commanding officer, frederick maloof, wrote in his diary. \"the party was a huge success, except that the beer ran out about 10:30 p.m.,\" 1st lt. maloof later reported. \"all agreed that the orchestra was good. a few of the die-hards were still crooning over the empty beer barrels at an early morning hour .\" for all the good times, the strains of war were ever present for dunham and his fellow soldiers. on the evening after d-day, dunham's unit dug 27 foxholes. \"this was done in case of a retaliation by the germans,\" maloof wrote. on june 11, the first hospital ships returned from france, bringing tales of the \"hardships encountered on invasion day .\" that same day, maloof wrote that \"our mail has not been reaching home, and the wives and sweethearts are beginning to wonder if we have gone across the channel on the first wave .\" the wives included madelyn dunham, back home in wichita, kan., with stanley ann, a toddler who would grow up to be obama's mother. madelyn, the beloved grandmother known as \"toot\" who helped raise the future president, did her part for the war effort, working the night shift as a supervisor on the b-29 bomber assembly line at the boeing plant. her brother is part of the war story, too. <mark>charles payne</mark>, obama's great-uncle, in 1945 helped liberate a sub-camp of the nazi concentration camp at buchenwald, which obama will visit this friday. stanley dunham's older brother ralph, another great-uncle to obama, also is a branch in the wartime family tree. ralph was called up after stanley enlisted. he landed at normandy's omaha easy red beach on d-day plus four, then worked his way through france, italy and germany as an assignment and personnel officer. in the months before the invasion, the brothers met up twice in england while on leave. once, they came across each other by happenstance in london, where ralph was staying at the russell hotel. \"i walked down the steps, and there was my brother, sitting on a settee,\" 92-year-old ralph dunham said in interview with the ap. late in july, six weeks after d-day, stanley dunham's unit crossed the english channel and landed at omaha beach. \"after looking over the atlantic wall, with its pill boxes, we all agreed it was a miracle that the allies were able to land,\" maloof wrote. in his autobiography, obama reports that during the war his grandfather was \"sloshing around in the mud of france, part of patton's army .\" that's right, at least for a few months. in february 1945, at saint-dizier, dunham's unit was assigned to patton's 3rd army, and dunham remained in that company until early april. prior to february, dunham's unit had supported 1st army operations. obama sketches dunham as a man with a wild streak early on who settled down to sell furniture and life insurance. by the time he joined the army, he already had lived large. dunham also had fallen in love with a woman from the other side of the tracks - the good side - and married her. he eloped with madelyn <mark>payne</mark> just before the bombing of pearl harbor, on dec. 7, 1941, and he was quick to enlist after the japanese attack. \"he was really gung-ho,\" remembers ralph. \"he didn't have to go because he was married. he could have held off .\" he was inducted at fort leavenworth, kan., on jan. 15, 1942."}, {"articleID": "2014021114_00015779_W", "names": {"David Cameron": ["Q1173911", "Q16195447", "Q18719363", "Q192", "Q47345547", "Q51808902", "Q5232111"], "Jeremy Hunt": ["Q333533", "Q929730"], "George Osborne": ["Q18527503", "Q332493", "Q47452635", "Q5543055"], "Philip Hammond": ["Q18388174", "Q332987"], "Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"], "William Hague": ["Q19596830", "Q58282"], "Owen Paterson": ["Q197894", "Q345827"], "Patrick Mcloughlin": ["Q333267", "Q7147184"], "Maria Miller": ["Q23020994", "Q334261"], "David Jones": ["Q10450056", "Q1174792", "Q1174894", "Q1174896", "Q16105375", "Q16945194", "Q17314899", "Q18350685", "Q18921618", "Q19665551", "Q20655901", "Q20732856", "Q21467224", "Q21467227", "Q24007312", "Q24007313", "Q260857", "Q2747788", "Q27906151", "Q27983475", "Q3018172", "Q312803", "Q4042624", "Q458276", "Q49193215", "Q50633601", "Q51397308", "Q52356357", "Q5235721", "Q5235722", "Q5235734", "Q5235735", "Q5235742", "Q5235743", "Q5235745", "Q5235746", "Q5383", "Q54666079", "Q56248428", "Q56507984", "Q56596961", "Q56604601", "Q57497739", "Q57552289", "Q728167"], "Simon Clark": ["Q19665441", "Q2082072", "Q7518465", "Q7518467"]}, "date": "2014-02-11", "url": "http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140211/world/uk-mps-vote-to-ban-smoking-in-cars.506271", "content": "Press Association Commons votes to ban smoking in cars carrying children Campaigners have welcomed plans backed by MPs which could save hundreds of thousands of children from being exposed to second-hand smoke in cars. Leading medical charities said they were \"delighted\" that the House of Commons had voted in favour of paving the way for for legislation which could outlaw smoking in vehicles carrying children. The Commons gave the Health Secretary the power to impose a ban despite the opposition of some MPs, including leading members of the Cabinet. Ministers were granted a free vote on the measure - successfully introduced by Labour in a House of Lords amendment to the Children and Families Bill - meaning they were not tied to a party line. The British Medical Association (BMA), which has campaigned for a ban since 2011, said the vote was an \"important step forward in reducing tobacco harm\". Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: \"Having campaigned on this issue for many years, we're absolutely delighted that MPs have backed the ban on smoking in cars carrying children .\" This could prove a great leap forward for the health of our nation's children. \"The introduction of a law that would help prevent hundreds of thousands of children from being exposed to second-hand smoke in the car is now within reach .\" With both Houses of Parliament having made their support for the ban clear, the onus is now on the Government to act accordingly and make this crucial child protection measure law at the earliest opportunity. \"The charity estimates that in England more than 430,000 children aged 11 to 15 are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars every week. Research published by the organisation last year concluded that 185,000 children of the same age are exposed to smoke while in the family car on\" most days \", if not every day. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health) described the vote as\" an historic victory for Parliament and for children's health \". Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs joined forces with Labour MPs to approve the ban by 376 votes to 107, majority 269. Prime Minister <mark>David Cameron</mark> missed the vote while visiting flood-stricken areas in the south west. Mr <mark>Cameron</mark>'s official spokesman declined to say which way the Prime Minister would have voted had he been able to attend Parliament. But he told a regular Westminster media briefing:\" While he understands the concerns that some have expressed, his view is that the time for this kind of approach has come. \"Health Secretary <mark>Jeremy Hunt</mark> was in favour of the move, together with Chancellor <mark>George Osborne</mark>, Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, Defence Secretary <mark>Philip Hammond</mark> and Education Secretary Michael Gove, International Development Secretary Justine Greening, Scotland Secretary Alistair Carmichael and Energy Secretary Ed Davey. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling was in the\" no \"camp of those who said it was unenforceable. Home Secretary <mark>Theresa May</mark>, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers also opposed the ban. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg missed the vote but has spoken out against attempts to\" sub-contract responsible parenting to the state \". Also missing were Foreign Secretary <mark>William Hague</mark>, Business Secretary Vince Cable, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Environment Secretary <mark>Owen Paterson</mark>, who is out recovering from eye surgery, Transport Secretary <mark>Patrick McLoughlin</mark>, Culture Secretary <mark>Maria Miller</mark> and Wales Secretary <mark>David Jones</mark>. Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger welcomed the result as a\" great victory for child health \"but warned ministers not to\" kick this into the long grass \". But pro-smoking groups branded the move as an\" unnecessary intrusion \". <mark>Simon Clark</mark>, director of the smokers' group Forest, said he was\" disappointed but not surprised \"by the decision and accused the Government of being\" spineless \". He added:\" Legislation will have very little impact because so few adults still smoke in cars carrying children. Those that do will carry on because it will be very difficult to enforce. \"Government has banned smoking in public places. Now they're going to ban it in a private place. The home will be next .\" Health Minister Jane Ellison told MPs the success of a smoking ban in cars carrying children will not be measured by the number of times the police enforce it. Instead, she said, its success would be gauged by the reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke. AA president Edmund King said: \"As has been the case with enforcing the ban on hand-held phones while driving, campaigns and legislation have been shown to reduce illegal behaviour afterwards. If a new law manages to make more adults think twice before lighting up with the kids on board, it will have helped .\" Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor <mark>may</mark>, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
