[{"date": "2010-08-05", "url": "http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2010/08/05/baker-palling-around-with-hudak.aspx", "content": "bill hudak, republican congressional candidate in <mark>john tierney</mark>'s district, has not been universally embraced by mainstream massachusetts republicans--in fact, when hudak announced that <mark>scott brown</mark> had endorsed him, <mark>brown</mark> quickly denied it and forced a retraction. that cold shoulder is due to some rather disturbing and, some might say, nutty opinions hudak has expressed, such as once suggesting to journalists that he had documentation proving that barack obama was born in kenya. but <mark>charlie baker</mark> has no problem appearing with the guy. a couple of weeks ago, <mark>baker</mark> accepted an invitation to speak at a large hudak event; he came, took the stage with hudak, and briefly addressed the audience. the photo above, obtained by the phoenix, shows <mark>baker</mark> speaking at the event, gesturing to the bow-tied hudak. \"<mark>charlie</mark> was speaking to voters,\" campaign spokesperson rick gorka told me, when i asked about <mark>baker</mark> choosing to associate with hudak. \"we're going to talk to voters everywhere .\" originally reported by tri-town transcript. among the highlights: hudak, in 2008, proudly displayed on his boxford lawn an array of anti-obama signs, one of which depicted barack obama as osama bin laden. he showed reporters documents that, he claimed, proved that obama was born in kenya. (he has admitted showing the documents, but now denies that he believed them .) he claimed that obama had ties to the muslim faith. he referred to obama as \"barry soetoro,\" as is common on so-called \"birther\" web sites. asked whether <mark>baker</mark> personally considers hudak's questioning of obama's citizenship, or comparing obama to bin laden, offensive, gorka replied: \"they're not things <mark>charlie</mark> agrees with .\" pressed again, gorka termed those things \"outrageous,\" but would not accept the characterization of \"offensive .\" (as an aside, i'm not sure why the <mark>baker</mark> campaign brought in gorka from the republican national committee to be its press secretary--not only is he alien to massachusetts, but his resume of working for folks like <mark>katherine harris</mark>, <mark>michael steele</mark>, and the now-defunct freedom's watch may not make him a great fit for our poitical-media landscape .) the event <mark>baker</mark> appeared at was a hudak campaign fundraiser/rally at the north shore music theater in beverly--\"stand up for america: a celebration of freedom .\" todd feinburg, jeff katz, and <mark>barbara anderson</mark> participated, and hudak claims that 500 people attended. among those on hand were former congressman peter torkildsen, state representatives <mark>brad hill</mark> and <mark>brad jones</mark>, and a host of area legislative candidates. gorka insists that <mark>baker</mark>'s on-stage appearance did not suggest an endorsement of, or support for, hudak. but wicked local topsfield, for one, came away with a different impression; a photo caption accompanying their story about the event included the line: \"also on hand to support hudak's candidacy for the 6th district seat were <mark>charlie baker</mark>...\" and, while hudak is clear that <mark>baker</mark> has not endorsed him, he did suggest, at the least, a camaraderie between the campaigns, when i asked him about <mark>baker</mark>'s appearance. \"we're all in this working together,\" hudak says. i've spoken with hudak a couple of times, and he comes across as a nice enough guy. but, his rabid, conspiratorial, admittedly internet-researched attacks on obama are about all we have to assess him; he had never been politically active prior to his late - 2008 outburst of anti-obamaism. pretty much all we know is that he believes, and acts upon, crazy, offensive things he reads on the internet. i can't imagine that it helps <mark>baker</mark> to associate himself with that fringe of the republican party. plus ultimate 2010 jam revealed, <mark>joe perry</mark> wrecked, and <mark>neil young</mark> unplayable the low anthem, yim yames, john prine, <mark>sharon jones</mark>, edward sharpe and more, live from newport, july 30 - august 1, 2010 ontario dream-pop duo find inspiration in the library stacks getting folked prine, helm, and edward sharpe highlight the newport fest burn baby burn <mark>john kerry</mark>, <mark>scott brown</mark>, and the death of climate-change legislation the black keys live at the bank of america pavilion, july 31, 2010 [video] interview w/aa bondy - hahaha...people in dr. seuss hats!

sofia black d'elia will be playing the role of tea on the us version of skins. as autostraddle reported before anyone else in the entire universe because we are awesome and work really hard, the uk original's gay character, maxxie, is being swapped out in favor of a lesbian. initially they'd been casting for a latino gayboy, \"teo,\" but then decided to take another route and thus, tea was born. sofia's prior acting credits include all my children. eura, btw, is effy, and seems to be a relatively unknown actress. you can see more photos of the cast on ohnotheydidnt. the people in charge also had stuff to say about how the mtv version will differ from the uk original, and why mtv is optimistic about the direction of its programming: \"millennials are all about authenticity,\" said david janollari, head of the network's scripted development. \"we're pursuing a more authentic v? rit? style with our reality shows and with our scripted programs .\" the risqu? teen soap gives an unvarnished look at teen lives in a way that \"gossip girl\" and \"90210\" can't even dare to mimic. it helps that much of the writing on \"skins,\" the british version of which airs stateside on bbc america, is done by young people, said the series' co-creator bryan elsley. and, he added, casting young actors to bring life to those teen stories is also central to its success; five of the central cast members in the mtv series are under 18 - the targeted demographic of the original series. so have they watched? \"i had seen a couple of episode prior to being cast on the show,\" said james newman, who will play tony snyder. \"once i was cast, i stopped watching it? to bring something new to the show and the character that i'm playing .\" the cast at the tca panel (the blonde in the back is effy, the red-headed girl in the front is michelle): for a thorough mindfuck, here's the cast of usa skins with cast members of jersey shore: jane lynch: jane lynch will host an episode of saturday night live in october.

(@ queerty) queen latifah: so these photos of queen latifah with her girlfriendimeanpersonaltrainer on a boat are being touted as \"proof\" of their hot sexy lesbian relationship, which i guess that would be cool if that were true, but mostly these photos remind me of the way your third grade teacher had to hug you to avoid getting fired for child sexual abuse: am i wrong, or is this the most awkward a-frame hug in history? other scandalous and revealing photos include \"smiling while standing on the same part of the boat\" and \"one watching the other spray sunscreen on herself .\" hot!
