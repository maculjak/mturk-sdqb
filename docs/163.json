batum a sought-after small forward with ties to the trail blazers traveled from europe to portland on tuesday, poised to sign a multi-year contract. nicolas batum? not quite. spaniard victor claver announced on twitter early tuesday that he was headed to portland, presumably to take a physical and sign a contract as part of the formalities involved with finally joining the blazers. and with no roy hibbert offer sheet to finalize and batum's flirtation with the minnesota timberwolves in a holding pattern as of late tuesday, claver's travel plans were perhaps the biggest news of the day for the blazers. after 10 days of rumor and speculation, the moratorium on nba free agency was lifted at 9 p.m. tuesday night, meaning teams were permitted to sign free agents and complete trades. because the blazers fell short in their flashy free agent pursuit of all-star center hibbert, it was a relatively quiet tuesday evening. the most immediate concern now surrounds the future of batum, the blazers' restricted free agent. although multiple published reports said last week that minnesota was prepared to offer a four-year, $45-million contract to batum, it did not appear that an offer sheet had been signed by 10:45 p.m. pdt. batum's agent, bouna ndiaye, declined to comment tuesday and said via text message that he and batum would remain silent until batum's free agency is resolved. but batum, who has remained mute about his free agent prospects since the end of the season, did temporarily break his silence for a story with nba.com earlier in the day. in that report, batum acknowledged that his preference was to leave portland for the timberwolves and expressed excitement about the possibility of playing for coach rick adelman and alongside <mark>kevin love</mark> and ricky rubio. clearly last week's three-day recruiting effort by the timberwolves, during which batum met with owner glen taylor, president of basketball operations <mark>david kahn</mark> and adelman, was successful. \"i'm a restricted free agent,\" batum told nba.com. \"i know the situation. anywhere i sign, the blazers are going to match. but my first choice was, and is, minnesota. that's where i want to play and that's where i want to put my family .\" ultimately, as batum noted, he will not get to decide where he plays. even if he signs an offer sheet with the timberwolves, the blazers will have 72 hours to match and keep batum in portland. batum told nba.com the sides were working on a sign-and-trade to facilitate his desire to play for minnesota, but blazers general manager neil olshey told the oregonian last week he had no intention of trading the team's starting small forward. it's clear that one party in this poker game is bluffing; it's unclear who will blink first .--joe

provided by the taylor county, ga., sheriff's office. ap/taylor county sheriff office butler, ga. - a georgia girl told investigators she spent days at a time locked inside a small outhouse and a chicken coop, and had to wear a shock collar because she didn't do her school work, authorities said thursday. the 15-year-old girl's parents, samuel and diana franklin, were arrested earlier this week on multiple counts of child cruelty and false imprisonment. they were released on bond, and declined to comment as they left the courthouse thursday for what appeared to be a custody hearing. \"i've never seen anything like this personally,\" said special agent <mark>wayne smith</mark> of the georgia bureau of investigation. \"if the allegations prove to be true, it's a very severe case .\" the girl was adopted around 2007 and home-schooled in a house outside the small town of butler, about 85 miles south of atlanta, according to <mark>smith</mark>. the franklins live on a rural stretch of road sprinkled with a few homes and cow pastures. the house is surrounded by a split-rail fence with prominent \"no trespassing\" signs at the entrance of the driveway. the girl told investigators she spent up to six days at a time in the small buildings in the back of the property as punishment for such things as failing to complete her school assignments, <mark>smith</mark> said. she said she had been put in the buildings for at least the past two years. the outhouse was about 4 feet in length and width, and just a few feet high, <mark>smith</mark> said. \"it was just big enough to sit in,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. the red chicken coop was much larger than the outhouse and chickens were being kept there thursday. the girl \"might come out during the day a little bit, come in and shower,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. a neighbor refused to speak with an associated press reporter and told him to leave the property. the investigation began may 25, when child welfare agents, acting on a tip, visited the home with the sheriff's department. that same day, juvenile court judge <mark>wayne</mark> jernigan sr. ordered the teen removed from the home. <mark>smith</mark> said he believed the franklins were in court thursday for a custody hearing. he was not aware of the outcome, and court officials refused to answer questions about the hearing. on tuesday, when the parents were taken into custody, investigators found a dog collar on a table in the home, <mark>smith</mark> said. the girl told investigators its shock function was operated by a radio signal with a device similar to those used to lock and unlock cars remotely. it was being examined at a crime lab. the girl lived at the home with another sibling, while two other siblings are older and lived away from home. the charges involve only the 15-year-old girl, <mark>smith</mark> said, and there are no allegations of abuse involving the other three children. a spokeswoman for the state department of family and children's services said state law prevented her from answering questions about the case. after the girl was removed from the house, <mark>smith</mark> said she began to open up to investigators. \"kind of what has happened is within a few hours of being taken out of that environment, a lot of this began to flow very freely,\" <mark>smith</mark> said. \"you almost have to remove the person from the threat of punishment before they begin to open up to you. that's normal, and that's what has happened here .\" print email share comments recommend tweet related stories police

the club's wantaway players as his purchase of their contracts is not valid, according to an employment law expert. <mark>green</mark>: purchase player contracts and registrations follow us on twitter the club's administrators, duff and phelps, revealed earlier this week that <mark>green</mark>'s? 5.5 million purchase of rangers' assets included a? 2.75 m payment to purchase the contracts and registrations of the players. duff and phelps, appointed by the court of session on february 14, broke down all the \"asset realisations\" and it was shown that <mark>green</mark>'s consortium paid for the club's employees to transfer to his company under tupe regulations, which protects employees' terms and conditions of employment when a business is transferred from one owner to another. however, on the advice of their union, pfa scotland, numerous players have rejected the opportunity to transfer their contracts from rangers to <mark>green</mark>'s sevco consortium. <mark>green</mark> rejects the claim that the players are free agents and the former sheffield united chief executive sent letters to clubs across the uk warning them that the players who objected to the switch to his new company were in breach of contract. international clearance for the transfers of <mark>steve davis</mark>, kyle lafferty, jamie ness, <mark>steven whittaker</mark> and steven naismith has been put on hold as <mark>green</mark> continues to dispute the players' status. naismith has moved to everton, <mark>whittaker</mark> has signed for norwich and ness has joined stoke. northern irish duo <mark>davis</mark> and lafferty are at southampton and swiss side sion respectively, while goalkeeper allan mcgregor is in talks with turkish club besiktas. despite <mark>green</mark> taking a firm stance, adrian hoggarth, the head of employment law at prolegal believes the deal struck may have been outside of the law. \"it is not legally possible for rangers and <mark>charles green</mark> to buy and sell players as part of a business transfer,\" he said. \"whether or not the players transferred in this case appears to depend on two things .\" firstly, were they assigned to the business of the football club when it transferred? this is a matter of law and this has nothing to do with any money that may have changed hands. \"secondly, were the players aware of the transfer at the time it took place? case law suggests that if you know about a transfer before it happens and don't object to it, you lose the right to object once the business transfers. if not, you don't.", "articleID": "2012071314_00094525_W", "names": {"Charles Green": ["Q17917702", "Q29514503", "Q5078396", "Q51584784"], "Steve Davis": ["Q1275803", "Q16201101", "Q30122863",

presidential candidate mitt romney depends on a wide network of venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers and other wall street bankers to raise the hundreds of millions he has amassed in his bid to oust president obama, a usa today analysis of his fundraising operation shows. republican presidential candidate mitt romney speaks at the naacp annual convention wednesday in houston. by evan vucci, ap republican presidential candidate mitt romney speaks at the naacp annual convention wednesday in houston. more than 300 people - or nearly a quarter of the roughly 1,200 individuals usa today has identified as romney fundraisers - come from the world of finance, more than any other sector. more than a dozen come from the ranks of a single company, investment powerhouse goldman sachs, which spent nearly $4.4 million to influence washington policymakers last year. by comparison, 77 of obama's 532 fundraisers work in the securities and investment industry, according to a tally by the non-partisan center for responsive politics. obama has slammed romney's record in private equity, while romney has pledged to dismantle financial-industry regulations enacted during the obama administration. those fundraisers who commit to raising as much as $250,000 to host romney at dinners and receptions include diet guru jenny craig, who hosted romney at her california beachfront home, billionaire hedge-fund guru <mark>julian robertson</mark> and todd heap. romney's supporters have unleashed torrents of campaign cash since he effectively clinched the democratic national committee. the june haul marks the second month in a row romney and the gop have outraised obama, as wall street and other interests turn away from a president who has slammed romney's record as a venture capitalist - and flock to romney, who has pledged to dismantle new financial-industry regulations erected during obama's time in office. unlike obama, romney has refused to name his top fundraisers. usa today reviewed federal election commission data, invitations to 85 romney fundraising events obtained by the non-partisan sunlight foundation, campaign news releases and news accounts to offer a snapshot of romney's fundraising network. political fundraisers, often known as \"bundlers\" for their ability to bundle together contributions from family, friends and business associates, are crucial to politicians collecting money in small increments from thousands of donors. bundlers are so valuable that presidents often reward them with ambassadorships. romney's most prolific supporters also have performed double duty - writing large checks to restore our future, a pro-romney super pac that can raise unlimited amounts to aid his white house bid as long as it operates independently of his campaign. more than 90 of the fundraisers identified by usa today also have contributed $25,000 or more to the super pac. they have donated nearly $18.4 million to the group, which has spent more than $53 million to promote romney and attack his rivals. more on super pacs, romney fundraising story: mitt romney declining to disclose names of campaign bundlers story: payday lenders scrutinized

from the same world he comes from,\" said ellen miller of the sunlight foundation. \"while it's not surprising, it's sobering when you think about who has his left and right ear .\" the romney campaign did not respond to interview requests. bloomfield hills, mich., investment firm said he joined the fundraising team because of his family's close ties to romney's brother, scott, a michigan lawyer. romney's background in government and business have given him skills \"that surpass any candidate i've seen,\" schwartz said. he declined to say how much he has raised. \"we've made our very best efforts,\" schwartz said. romney has also tapped business, religious and family ties to build his fundraising network. his fundraisers include dozens of current and former executives of the consulting and private-equity firms he ran. dozens more are fellow mormons, such as jetblue founder u.s. ambassador to belgium <mark>sam fox</mark>, also have joined the fundraising circuit. scott romney is a national finance chairman. a st. louis businessman, <mark>fox</mark> said president obama \"means well\" but doesn't have the experience to right the troubled u.s. economy. <mark>fox</mark>, who said he had his assistants research romney's career in business and government after romney sought his support in 2005, said \"he's been successful at every problem he's taken on .\" he donated $190,000 to a pro-romney super pac but won't say how much he has raised - only that the \"floodgates opened\" once the former massachusetts governor clinched the nomination in may. neeleman called romney \"one of the smartest guys i know\" and said romney's long volunteer church service - first overseeing a local congregation as a mormon bishop and later as a stake president presiding over several congregations in suburban boston - demonstrates his kindness. the church does not have paid clergy, and bishops and stake leaders have broad responsibilities to manage budgets, deliver sermons and provide spiritual counseling. \"as a mormon, i know what that entails,\" neeleman said. \"you have to be very compassionate and loving. when i people say he's out of touch because he's rich? i'd like to see them give that kind of service .\" neeleman said he hosted a fundraiser for romney at his connecticut home in may, but said he's unsure how much was raised. indeed, without voluntary reporting from the campaigns themselves, it's impossible to determine exactly how much either presidential contender has raised through bundlers. every few months, obama releases a list of bundlers who have collected at least $50,000, but describes their fundraising totals only in broad ranges. the campaign's most recent release shows 532 people directed at least $106.4 million to obama's re-election efforts through april 20. among romney's backers: a georgia executive who was on the invitation as a host of a february fundraising event for romney a month after the securities and exchange commission accused him of insider trading. on jan. 9, the sec filed a civil complaint against parker \"pete\" petit, alleging petit tipped off a friend to the impending sale of matria healthcare, a health-wellness company where petit was ceo. on feb. 8, petit was on the host committee for a romney fundraiser at the w hotel in atlanta, according to an invitation obtained by the sunlight foundation. he gave $2,500 to romney's campaign feb. 6. petit has denied any wrongdoing. his lawyer, aaron danzig, sent usa today a january news release, saying the sec \"has targeted an innocent business executive .\" reprints & permissions, visit our faq's. to report corrections and clarifications, contact standards editor", "articleID": "2012071323_00072873_W", "names": {"Julian

says the administration repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" last year (cnn)--the u.s. department of defense is giving the go-ahead to all active-duty military personnel to wear their uniform to march in a gay pride parade in san diego on saturday, the first time such approval has been given in the united states. the defense department decision followed news that the navy had given approval to sailors to wear their uniform in the parade, which drew hundreds of active-duty service members last year shortly before the administration repealed \"don't ask, don't tell .\" \"based on our current knowledge of the event and existing policies, we hereby are granting approval for service members in uniform to participate in this year's parade,\" rene c. bardorf, deputy assistant secretary of defense for community and public outreach, said in a memorandum released thursday. the blanket approval for the various branches of the military applies only to the 2012 san diego pride parade, bardorf said. just a year ago, an active-duty service member faced punishment or discharge if he or she admitted being homosexual, but last september the administration scrapped the policy known as \"don't ask, don't tell .\" the defense department approval to allow service members to wear uniforms at the san diego parade follows reports that members of the military wore uniforms at a gay pride event held at the pentagon in june. under the guidelines released by the defense department, service members can wear their uniforms to march in the parade as long as they participate \"in a personal capacity\" and follow set standards of \"appearance and wear of the military uniform .\" while members of the military do not need approval to participate in civic events, they generally need approval to wear their uniforms. more than 300 active-duty service members have signed up to participate in the parade, dwayne crenshaw, executive director of san diego lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride, said thursday. last year, roughly 200 active-duty and retired military service members marched in the san diego parade, donning t-shirts to indicate their branch of military service. the 2011
