She was 81. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said her life was devoted to \"caring for the poor and underprivileged\" . Nirmala became the second head of the Missionaries of Charity after its founder Mother Teresa stepped down from the post in March 1997. The Nobel laureate died on September 5 the same year. Nirmala held the post till March 24, 2009, when she was succeeded by Sister Mary Prema. Archbishop of Kolkata <mark>Thomas D'Souza</mark> told IANS that the funeral mass will be held at the Mother House on Wednesday at 4 p.m. Sister Nirmala will be laid to rest at the St. John's cemetery. Born Nirmala Joshi in Ranchi to a Brahmin family from Nepal in 1934, she joined the MoC after converting from Hinduism in het youth. An MA in political science and a trained lawyer, Sister Nirmala started the MoC's contemplative branch in 1976 and headed it till 1997 when she was elected to succeed Mother Teresa as the order's Superior General. She was elected for a second term in 2003. Sister Nirmala was re-elected for a third term on March 13, 2009, but the MoC held a second election days later after she wanted to be relieved of the responsibility owing to ill-health and also expressed a desire to return to the contemplative life she led before heading the order. Sister Nirmala was honoured with India's second highest civilian order Padma Vibhushan in 2009 for her services to the nation. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condoled Sister Nirmala's death and tweeted: \"Saddened at the passing of Sister Nirmala who headed Missionaries of Charity after Mother Teresa. Kolkata and the world will miss her.\" Banerjee paid her last respects to Sister Nirmala at St John's Church here. Describing it as a personal loss, she said the state government will extend all help and cooperation for the last rites. International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) also extended its condolences. \"Her life of dedication and service especially to the poor is a great inspiration and it is to be pondered upon and to be followed,\" ISKCON's spokesperson Radharaman Das said. Stay updated wherever you go with Daijiworld.com and Daijiworld 24X7 tv channel mobile apps. My association with Sr.. Nirmala was in 1957 when she was a Hindu. Her name then was Kusum Joshi. She was doing her post graduation and we six of us Mangalorean teachers, working at Patna Womens College. She stayed with us along with her two sisters, Rabha and Bindu. She was also N.C.C. captain. A very jovial, smart and active person. Though she was a Hindu, she attended daily mass regularly. She was an inspiration to us catholics. After many years I met her in Mangalore as Sr.. Nirmala. I was extremely excited to see her. She told me then, that her sister Radha expired some years back and Bindu ian A.C. nun in one of the convents in the north. <mark>William Joseph</mark> & Milliana Concessao, Mangalore, Muscat.

Big thanks to you for the dedication of your entire life for the poor, sick, lepers, destitute and dying. Govt of India gave you Padma Vibushan for your dedicated service. Her father, who was an Army Officer in British Army till 1947, came to her convent with a gun to take back her. But, after sensing her determination and meeting Mother Theresa, we went back. I think her younger sister is also a sister in M.C. Tuesday, June 23, 2015 A very big thank you from the bottom of our hearts for dedicating your life to God in the service of the \"poorest of the poor' and the down trodden in the footsteps of our most Blessed Mother Teresa - a Saint to us.

Now that it's 2020, McBryde has another auspicious milestone in mind, with what's sure to be one of the year's grabbiest videos. But let's start with \"Martha Divine\" the song: The Arkansas-born singer's rowdiest jam to date, the track weaves its revenge narrative into a family's complicated history. The cheater in question is the singer's dad, but the target of McBryde's ire is his paramour, the titular Martha, who's in for a world of hurt. What \"Martha Divine\" lacks in healthy boundaries, appropriately placed anger or clarity about the proper legal definition of \"murder,\" however, it more than makes up for in raucous, hooky, fist-pumping catharsis. When she plays it live, this thing will shake ceilings--and that's saying nothing of McBryde's profoundly awesome delivery of \"idn't.\" (You'll know it when you hear it .) Then there's the video, which--like the subtler short film accompanying \"One Night Standards\" --uses a seedy motel as the backdrop for scenes ripped from a gritty crime drama. What the song implies, the video shouts: Martha Divine is sorry she ever saw the likes of Ashley McBryde, to say nothing of that shovel. \"\"Martha Divine' was so much fun to write because [the song's co-writer] Jeremy Spillman wasn't afraid to get weird with me,\" McBryde writes via email. \"I told him I wanted to write something dark, and we created this story that surrounds the most delightful trollop of a human being and gets down underneath the fingernails of the uncomfortable truth about family dynamics. I was certain no one would let me shoot a video that actually reflected the lyrics, but Reid Long helped me bring it to life in a way that only he could.\" Ashley McBryde's as-yet-announced second album is coming soon via Warner Music Nashville.

The next day, Lisa Vanderpump decided to play peacemaker and visited Rinna to say she felt she was horrible to Dorit. Vanderpump invited Rinna to a wine tasting at her house to see if she and Dorit could make things right with each other. \"Maybe she could apologize to Dorit because she's really been kind of a bitch to her, to be honest,\" Vanderpump said to the camera. While Rinna escaped to Philadephia for a work commitment, the other ladies embarked on a shopping trip, but Eden's strange behavior continued. Eden decided to latch on to Erika and tried to buy her a friendship ring. \"I don't understand why you're buying me this ring,\" Erika said, confused. \"Because I love you!\" Eden screamed back. \"Just say thank you, and' I love you, too .'\" Yeah, there's something odd about the way Eden tries to make nice with the ladies.

Jim Flaherty once zoomed down to Mexico City with six aides for a December 2011 overnighter to discuss G20 priorities with Mexico's president and assorted hangers-on. Not to seem cheap but what benefits did they derive from meeting face-to-face, rather than via Skype or conference call, to offset the $33,179 price tag? For that matter, why not just exchange a few e-mails full of nebulous generalities then decide the technical people will sort it all out and give you something to sign in front of the cameras wearing colourful local garb? After all, Flaherty spent another 30 grand flying back to Mexico City for a brief G20 finance minister's meeting two months later. If you ask me, G20 financial matters are too complex for 20 giant egos and umpteen aides to settle quickly face-to-face in some posh resort. Which might be why they don't ask me. Don't even mention Peter MacKay's August 2011, $17,411 overnighter the manifest listed as \"Ottawa, Ottawa, Ottawa.\" I'm already clutching my head going \"Ottawa, Ottawa, Ottawa.\" You see, the issue is ego inside the bubble.

Take <mark>John Baird</mark>, who flew commercial to Africa in December 2012 for a Friends of the Syrian People meeting in Marrakech then hopped the Challenger for a same-day \"G8 Broader Middle East and North Africa\" meeting in Tunis. The official explanation was there was no other way to attend both meetings. The problem is, there was no reason to. Nothing actually gets done in these gatherings that's worth a dime.

Her visit did nothing for Canada, Kyrgyz religious minorities or Orozbek Moldaliev personally (the press release boasts that she met with him). And every such press release calls every such visit successful because they are vacuously smug. Indeed, the real reason they keep flying around is they think they're so special their mere presence, even jet-lagged, harried and extravagant, has a transformative effect on problems they couldn't solve through hard work in a decade. And while the cost is a drop in the bucket of federal spending, it's still a high price to pay for them to stagger around foreign countries, pontificating on autopilot, bleary with fatigue, inflating their egos.

It's become akin to a four letter word for the Dallas Stars fanbase. The use of \"patience\" with die-hard fans generally elicits a very emotional and fervent response: \"I've been patient for five playoff-less years, I've run out of patience!\" Yes, the Stars haven't made the playoffs in five seasons straight. But what caused that streak is being turned around over the course of the last few seasons. However, the kind of damage done up until Tom Gaglardi took over isn't going to be undone overnight. During those five years, the Stars were run by <mark>Tom Hicks</mark> and then a group of banks as the team lingered through bankruptcy. As <mark>Hicks</mark> started to have finances go into decline, the amount of money spent on the roster was really reduced. Where Dallas had been a team that was in the top part of the league in spending to the cap, they all of a sudden found themselves near the bottom of the league. They were finally sold to Tom Gaglardi about two years ago. One of the first things Gaglardi did was to rebuild the front office--both on the sales/admin side as well as hockey operations. The Stars worked to get a good staff in sales and customer service in place. Gaglardi then worked to keep all of those employees through the prolonged lockout, even as other teams laid off employees and reduced hours and salaries. He invested in the people. The next focus was in making sure that the right people were hired to run the show. Jim Lites was brought in as the president (again .) He went out and hired Jim Nill, something many in the media felt was one of the biggest coups in hockey operations. They brought in a winning experienced coach in Lindy Ruff to coach the team and, along with Nill, to bring a winning pedigree to Dallas. He's come in and rebuilt the team from the top down, establishing a firm foundation for the team to build from. Then it came time to focus on the on-ice product. In Gaglardi, the Stars got a committed and passionate owner that isn't afraid to spend money on the team when it is warranted. They went out and offered contracts to free agents--something they hadn't been able to do for a time. Trades were made to take on salary, which allowed the team to try to improve in the short term while not rushing the prospects and remain competitive in the NHL. The farm system has been replenished. It had basically been depleted after <mark>Doug Armstrong</mark> had spent the previous seasons packaging up draft picks in trades. Coupled with not picking very high for seasons straight, the farm system was lacking the depth necessary to build a true consistent contender. They had to rely on free agency to plug holes in the roster. Through some shrewd trades, Joe Nieuwendyk did what he could for the team while he was general manager when he couldn't spend to the cap--he amassed draft picks and prospects in deals. The fruits of all of this ground work are starting to show. Young guys like Alex Chiasson are now contributing at the NHL level while guys like Brett Ritchie are developing well down in Austin. The Stars now have a team where prospect depth is a position of strength that they can use to better their roster, by allowing for pieces to be traded without being detrimental to the organization. They've made key trades and free agency signings to help the team be right in the mix this season. But they're still not there--yet. There are obvious holes in the roster: the defensive depth, while it is there, seems to hold a lot of redundancies in players that fit a certain mold. Goaltending depth has been tested at the lower levels due to injury already this season. Scoring wingers are needed for depth. One thing the Stars have now, however, is a man with a plan. Nill has come from an organization where patience with prospect development and roster construction reign supreme. He's bringing that calming, patient presence to a team that has lacked it in seasons past. Yes, the Stars haven't made the playoffs for five seasons straight. But I must say, the idea that this team is going to be built right excites me. I have more faith that Nill's plan will pay off in the long-term. Imagine a team that is a contender consistently instead of a flash-in-the-pan every few years. That dream is what keeps me patient, even when the Stars can be exasperating on some nights. They're going through some growing pains but I have every confidence that they'll get there at some point."}, {"articleID": "2008101613_00031424_W", "names": {"Tom Herman": ["Q25997639", "Q48850168", "Q7816168"]}, "date": "2008-10-16", "url": "http://ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?page=article&Article_ID=17141", "content": "dallas, tx 75251-1339 phone: (972) 386-6272 fax: (972) 386-0924 nw, suite 900 south building washington, dc 20004 on death and taxes because of tax-law changes in recent years, the federal estate tax now hits fewer estates than ever. the internal revenue service received a total of only 23,000 taxable estate-tax returns in 2006; down from 52,000 in 2001. even so, the estate tax is still a hot political issue. here is an update on the current law, where the candidates stand, and what their areas of agreement could mean for many families and their heirs. regarding exemption and rates: currently, the basic federal estate-tax exemption is $2 million per person and the top estate-tax rate is 45 percent; next year, the exemption is scheduled to jump to $3.5 million, the largest one-year increase in history. in 2010, the estate tax is supposed to disappear completely, and in 2011, the tax will return with an exemption of only $1 million and a top tax rate on the largest estates of 55 percent. mccain proposes raising the exemption as soon as possible to $5 million and cutting the top tax rate to only 15 percent. obama wants to keep the exemption at $3.5 million and the top rate at 45 percent. both candidates agree that the exemption amount should be easily portable: obama want to eliminate the estate tax for 99.7 percent of families. mccain opposes situations where taxpayers may have unfavorable tax consequences simply because they couldn't afford--or didn't know--to seek sophisticated tax planning advice. even though both candidates agree, nobody knows how quickly such a change might happen, what the effective date might be and how the fine print of legislative language would read. moreover, they agree on the idea of keeping today's system for valuing inherited property, including stocks and mutual-fund shares. source: <mark>tom herman</mark>, \"on death and taxes...and the candidates,\" wall street journal, october 15, 2008. we depend on the financial support of individuals. we need your help to continue our work."}, {"articleID": "2009072501_00011088_W", "names": {"Robert Heller": ["Q16018783", "Q22611916"]}, "date": "2009-07-25", "url": "http://jrdeputyaccountant.com/2009/07/looking-for-evidence-of-market.html", "content": "obviously australia holds their reserve bank in higher regard than we do here in the good ole us of a a blast from the past and a ppt primer, or, alternatively, \"the fed's greatest hits (or misses)\" from safe haven in case you missed it the first time around. amazing what you can discover when you only pay attention, eh? a tio is an abbreviation for term investment option, and is a way for the treasury to make extra income. from the treasury site here, the \"treasury will periodically auction excess operating funds to participants for a fixed term at a rate determined through a competitive bidding process.\" another view of tios from the st. louis fed is here. now for some interesting quotes, with our comments and simplications [sic?], from a few federal reserve members over the last 17 years: \"the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle. the foreign exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger. daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $130 billion. the daily volume for treasury securities is about $110 billion. the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange, the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $7 billion and $10 billion.\" --former federal reserve governor, <mark>robert heller</mark> in the wall street journal on october 27, 1989 1. governor <mark>heller</mark> actually admits that the fed can \"handle\" the stock market, way back in 1989. 2. the fed already participates in the $110 billion daily treasury securities market. all activity of all the stock markets is less than 10% of the size of the treasury market. \"an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market: the federal reserve...the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign exchange markets. the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities. the stock market is the only major market without a marketmaker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort.\" ...\"the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thus stabilizing the market as a whole.\" --former federal reserve governor, <mark>robert heller</mark> in the wall street journal on october 27, 1989 1. another admission by governor <mark>heller</mark> that the fed, way back in 1989, assumed responsibility for preventing \"disorderly conditions\" in the market for treasury bonds and bills. 2. he also observes the lack of a \"buyer of last resort\" , even though the executive order establishing the \"working group on financial markets\" (also sometimes called the plunge protection team, or ppt) was issued earlier in 1988. the avowed purpose of the ppt is to prevent or control a large stock market crash like what occurred in october 1987. \"executive order 12631 - working group on financial markets - mar. 18, 1988; 53 fr 9421, 3 cfr, 1988 comp., p. 559: by virtue of the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and laws of the united states of america, and in order to establish a working group on financial markets, it is hereby ordered as follows: the secretary of the treasury, or his designee; the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system, or his designee; the chairman of the securities and exchange commission, or his designee; and the chairman of the commodity futures trading commission, or her designee.\" 3. a method of \"supporting\" the stock market via buying futures was named. \"the last duty of a central banker is to tell the public the truth.\" --alan blinder, vice chairman of the federal reserve, on pbs's nightly business report in 1994 1. oh...2. our favorite quote from a member of the federal reserve.
