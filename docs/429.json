Experts on Dry January Experts give their views on whether a detox is essential to body functions and what happens in a month without booze. 04:09, UK, Friday 12 January 2018 Image: Dry January reaches its midway point this weekend Mail By <mark>Rebecca Taylor</mark>, News Reporter All around the country, people are hitting the halfway mark in their January detoxes and getting to grips with their New Year's resolutions. Whether it was to get to the gym more, eat more fruit and vegetables, or cut back on alcohol, there may be a slump around the corner requiring a new flex of willpower. But is there any point to a detox? What really happens to your body when you give up the booze? Should we all be trying to help our bodies cut out \"toxins'? Sky News spoke to experts to get the truth about the January detox. Yes to a detox - it's a great opportunity Image: Dr Sarah Brewer says a detox helps take opportunity to reset your diet Dr Sarah Brewer, author of more than 60 self-help books, told Sky News:\" I think a detox is a great opportunity to review and address your diet and change things that are wrong with it. Most people recognise that they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables, or protein. \"It is an opportunity to ditch the crap, and focus on a healthy diet .\" Avoiding alcohol is always a good thing to give your liver a rest. \"There is a lot of research to show supplements can help. If you take one thing, I recommend globe artichoke, to help the liver .\" During a detox, you eat a restricted selection of healthy and nutritious foods. You can eat as much or as little of these foods as you like, and do not necessarily need to lose weight. In practice, however, most people aim to halve their usual calorie intake to help boost the Detox process and to lose a few excess pounds. \"I do not recommend patches or colonics, it's all about focusing on your diet and cutting back .\" No to a detox - your liver does the job Image: Rhiannon Lambert says nothing detoxes like the liver Leading Harley Street Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert said: \"The good news is that that we all already have a detoxification system. It's called the liver and no tea, juice cleanse or diet will do it's job any better .\" Any suggestion that the human body can be detoxed with a tea, juice cleanse or patch is incorrect. We are naturally designed to remove toxins using our liver and kidneys - none of these perform such a detox. These items often prey on those individuals desperate for a quick fix or simply to feel healthier, when in reality just addressing their overall diet and lifestyle will work wonders and cost less. \"The idea that we kind do some kind of purge and purify our bodies is an attractive thought but the reality is you simply need to eat well most of the time. If you accept the marketing of any supposed detox, you're abandoning proven science .\" Food isn't strictly speaking medicine and encouraging people to see some food as toxic and others as pure is dangerous. In my experience, all detoxes do is push you into extreme calorie restriction. An obsession with a rule-driven way of eating like so-called detoxing is familiar to so many people with disordered eating. \"Image: Dry January has side effects like losing weight and saving money She added:\" There is no denying that alcohol should be limited as part of a healthy diet. All too often I see alcohol associated with weight gain and poor mental clarity. Any positive claims from alcohol stem largely from studies using quality red wine and often on males over the age of 50. There is a lot of research investigating the powerful plant compounds in red wine and their health benefits, including reduced inflammation, lower risk of heart disease and extended lifespan. \"Choose your alcohol wisely and remember that alcohol can be addictive and excessive consumption can cause a whole host of health issues .\" Dry January: What happens after you give up alcohol? Many people may now be starting to see some differences in their appearance and their wellbeing as they make it to the second weekend in January without alcohol. In general, those who give up alcohol for one to two weeks report better quality of sleep, and see improvements in their skin. According to Drinkaware, drinking alcohol helps people to drop off to sleep quicker, but it prevents the body staying in deep sleep, and entering REM cycles (rapid eye movement). This means while the glass of red might send you to sleep, it'll make you groggy the next day too. Image: Friends Ruari and Andy set up One Year No Beer Reducing alcohol intake could also benefit your skin, as it's a diuretic, meaning it makes you dehydrated. Cutting back will help your skin and eyes to sparkle. Many people report weight loss, as the empty calories of alcohol are replaced with lower calories alternatives, and making up lbs with pounds when they don't get tied into rounds at the pub. Friends Andy Ramage and Ruari Fairburns gave up alcohol for a year after becoming fed up of late nights and hangovers entertaining clients in the City of London. Now, they've written a book together, The 28 Day Alcohol Free Challenge, and run programmes encouraging people to knock the pints on the head for as long as they can, from 28 days to 365. Mr Fairburns said: \"We have worked with the University of Stirling and we've found that people who do our programme get an\" epiphany' moment somewhere between 20 and 60 days. \"This epiphany is' I feel amazing'. It happens to nearly everyone who regularly drinks more than 14 units a week, four large glasses of wine. Image: Andy's body changed dramatically when he stopped drinking\" They think' I feel limitless'. Many people who stick to our 28 days end up staying to do 90 days or longer without alcohol. \"He added that humans naturally want to fit into a tribe, and for some tribes, they can be defensive when one member stops drinking. But the key can be finding a tribe with a different common interest, or who can help keep you on the no alcohol path.

On his return to the continent this week with a trip to Catholic majority Chile and Peru, Francis will not only speak his native Spanish but also a vibrant spiritual and cultural language common to all. \"I feel free, nothing scares me,\" the pontiff once said, despite shouldering the burden of leading the world's 1.3 billion Catholics, nearly half of whom live in the Americas. It was a typically American expression according to fellow Argentine, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who has known Francis for decades. \"North and South America are both societies with European origins that have realised they need independence. The idea of freedom is the cornerstone of the Americas,\" the philosophy professor told AFP. The first pope to address the United States congress has \"a strong sense of human dignity and freedom\" , he says. But while one of the Americas has prospered, the other has become increasingly impoverished. \"The pope is very sensitive to the issue of social justice--a more Latin than North American theme, hence the interest he has for the\" peripheries' in difficulty, \"Sorondo said, referring to Francis's support for those on the margins .--\"Link between worlds'--The Archbishop of Buenos Aires was virtually an unknown when he was elected on March 13, 2013, becoming the first pope to choose the name Francis--a homage to St. Francis of Assisi, who dedicated his life to the poor. The Argentine hails from a family of Italian immigrants and became\" a sort of link between the Old World and the New World \", says Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of the Vatican's L\u2019Osservatore Romano newspaper. However,\" the dramatic history of Argentina at the end of the 20th century is what shapes his personal trajectory \", he says in the preface to a book called\" Francis, the American pope \". In 2007, Jorge Bergoglio was elected by his fellow bishops in Aparecida in Brazil to draw up the final document of the Latin American Episcopal Council, which can be read as a guide to many of the themes dearest to him. Bergoglio stressed the ills of a\" scandalous inequality which wounds personal dignity \", a theme which\" clearly guides his actions at the head of the church today \", Vatican specialist Nicolas Seneze writes in\" The Words of the Pope \". The Aparecida conference\" prioritised the poor \", Sarondo said .\" The pope is very critical of capitalism which sacrifices human rights--a typical stance of the Latin American episcopate, \"he added .--\"Faith and blood'--While Polish pope <mark>John Paul</mark> II had denounced\" wild capitalism \", Francis has taken more concrete steps, such as calling for\" a poor church for the poor \"and turning down a luxurious papal apartment for a humble hotel room, he said. Bergoglio was an active pastor, taking the bus around Buenos Aires and heading without a second thought into slums in Latin America to comfort the poor. An inmate at the Virgen de Fatima Women's prison in Lima shows handmade wooden rosaries made by the prisoners. A total of 72 inmates in the prison have produced 33,000 rosaries to be sold at stores in Lima, to donate the proceedings to Pope Francis His experience of the Argentine economic crisis has also shaped his idea of\" the misery of big cities \", which fatally attract poor farmers from the countryside in search of a better life, stripping them of their culture. His vision was strongly influenced by the\" theology of the people \", the Argentine, non-violent version of the South American Liberation theology--a strain without the focus on the Marxist class struggle. And since his arrival in Rome, the pope has created new Latin American cardinals, saying\" they bring with them the air of new churches and of a history of faith and of blood \". In doing so, he is also reshaping in his image the conclave of cardinals that will elect his successor.", "articleID": "2018011403_00553729_W", "names": {"John Paul": ["Q1701359", "Q6252169"]}}, {"date": "2018-01-14", "url": "http://www.rutlandherald.com/articles/otter-creek-solar-gets-contract-offer/", "content": "Developers have received a contract offer for one of two solar projects proposed for Windcrest Road in Rutland Town, they said Friday. The two projects would together generate more than 7 megawatts of power. FILE PHOTO The developers of the proposed Otter Creek Solar projects in Rutland Town said they have received a contract offer for the smaller of the two solar projects proposed for Windcrest Road. <mark>Brad Wilson</mark> of Ecos Energy, said Friday the two projects have yet to receive a certificate of public good from the Public Utility Commission. \"The projects have moved through the 248 process and now we're in the stage of waiting for a decision,\" <mark>Wilson</mark> said. <mark>Wilson</mark> is working for the Melone family of New York City which has several solar projects in Rutland and Bennington counties pending before the Vermont Public Utility Commission. The Otter Creek Solar project would be built on a 56-acre parcel, with the larger project on 17.5 acres, and the smaller one on 10.8 acres. The projects were split into two different projects in order to qualify for the state's renewable energy credits, which required any project to be smaller than 5 megawatts. When the projects were first proposed in 2016, Allco expected to have started construction in 2017. <mark>Wilson</mark> said recent statements at a public meeting last week in Rutland Town that the developers had pulled back from the project weren't correct. \"We are currently pursuing contracts for both,\" he said. Otter Creek Solar, a project of Allco Renewable Energy Ltd., has proposed two, side-by-side solar projects on 57 acres of forested land between Windcrest and Cold River roads. The larger of the two projects would generate 4.9 megawatts of power, and the smaller one less than half that, 2.2 megawatts. <mark>Wilson</mark> said the smaller project had received a contract offer and that Allco was currently evaluating the offer. According to a Dec. 14 order from the Public Utility Commission, it was moving the Otter Creek 2 project up on its list of project that qualify for the commission's \"standard offer' list, since a different solar project in northern Vermont had been disqualified. Power contracts are often considered key to winning approval from state regulators. In the December 14 order, the PUC said it was awarding the Otter Creek Solar 2 project a contract and was referring it to Vermont Electric Power Producers Inc. of Manchester, which administers the standard-offer process for the state. The order stated that the Otter Creek Solar 2 project was the\" least-cost proposal in this year's reserve group. \"\"The larger of the two projects does not currently have a contract,\" said <mark>Wilson</mark>, who denied that Allco was having trouble nailing down a project for the Rutland Town solar projects. The Public Utility Commission recently ordered a review of its standard-offer process, where energy developers are guaranteed a certain power rate in an effort to promote the development of alternative renewable power sources.

Former Republican state Rep. Brandon Hixon, 36, died Tuesday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Canyon County Coroner Vicki DeGeus-Morris told CNN. Hixon's death follows the December death of Kentucky state Rep. <mark>Dan Johnson</mark>, also a Republican, who had been accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in 2013. <mark>Johnson</mark> died a day after denying the allegations, and the Bullitt County, Kentucky, coroner ruled the death a suicide. Hixon, who was in his third term, resigned from the Idaho legislature in late October. Shortly after the resignation, reports in local media said Hixon was under investigation for sexual abuse, with the Idaho Statesman citing the state attorney general's office in its news report. Idaho Speaker of the House Rep. Scott Bedke announced Hixon's death Tuesday on the chamber floor. \"Our thoughts go to his family and friends who are suffering from his loss,\" said Bedke, who did not respond to CNN's request for further comment. Sex abuse case rises to state level The Canyon County prosecutor's office initially handled the complaint against Hixon, county spokesman Joe Decker told CNN. The investigation was transferred to the state attorney general \"due to a conflict of interest,\" according to a document provided to CNN by Scott Graf, director of constituent affairs for the Idaho Office of the Attorney General. The document notes that the case relates to \"Brandon Hixon, Sexual Abuse Allegations .\" The attorney general's office would not comment further on the sexual abuse accusations against Hixon. Hixon's legal troubles continued after he resigned from the legislature. He was arrested on December 9 and charged with two misdemeanors: driving under the influence and resisting arrest, Ada County Sheriff's Office spokesman Patrick Orr told CNN. Hixon was arrested again later in December for \"suspicion of driving under the influence,\" Capt. Devin Riley of the Caldwell Police Department told CNN. Alleged victims were minors, ex-wife says Hixon's ex-wife, Danielle Eirvin Hixon, told CNN that the alleged victims in the sexual abuse case against her former husband were two underage girls. She said one of the alleged victims told her about the suspected sexual abuse in October. Eirvin Hixon, who was married to Hixon for 10 years before they divorced in May 2016, said it was the first she'd learned of abuse allegations against Hixon. Eirvin Hixon told CNN she's speaking out because she wants to help the alleged victims. \"It isn't fair for his victims that they be silenced because he's no longer here,\" Eirvin Hixon told CNN. Eirvin Hixon told CNN she was due to testify before a grand jury considering the allegations against Hixon on Wednesday morning, the day after he killed himself. The Idaho attorney general's office would not comment on Eirvin Hixon's assertions.

(Photo: freeimages.com) One of underappreciated pleasures of living near the shores of Puget Sound in northwest Washington state is the annual springtime spectacle: watching juvenile bald eagles attempting to fend off a determined flock (murder?) of crows working as a team to drive the eagles away from their nesting areas. Sometimes these aerial battles, which literally take place right above my backyard, last as long as four or five minutes. Surprisingly, the young eagles are not nearly as adept as you might imagine, and the clever crows use their superior agility and numbers to harass the eagles until they're forced to fly away. Of course, when I lived back East years ago, the sight of a bald eagle, juvenile or otherwise, would have been front-page news, because back then, eagles were a species that was threatened with extinction. The reason proved to be straightforward: Widespread use of the potent pesticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane). The problem was that DDT is solvent in fats or oils. As a result, it bio-accumulates in the fatty tissues of animals, especially those at the top of the food chain, such as predators like eagles, hawks and condors. In humans, DDT exposure can cause damage to the liver, the nervous system and even birth defects. With eagles, their numbers began declining sharply in the 1960s and 1970s because the DDT they were ingesting made their eggshells thin and fragile, and the birds weren't able to reproduce effectively. Now just this year, the symbol of the nation has been removed from the protected list by the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission, which acknowledged the raptor's comeback from threatened extinction. \"It's a real success story,\" agency spokesperson Hannah Anderson told news reporters. A Regulation that Worked It's easy to demonize the mass of federal regulations, and truthfully, many are cumbersome and problematic for businesspeople. EPA, in particular, has been excoriated by agricultural interests as an agency whose authority ought to be eviscerated, since its agenda (allegedly) is anti-industry. Blanket condemnation of any federal agency is counterproductive, however, and in the case of the bald eagle, as well as other avian species, EPA's regulatory authority turned out to be downright heroic. That's because in 1972, EPA banned the use of DDT, not only because of its impact on wildlife, but also because its toxicity was determined to be seriously problematic for people, as well. It took several decades, but once the pesticide was removed from the environment, the populations of eagles and other raptors began to rebound. In fact, a recent study by the state of Washington identified 1,334 eagle nesting sites, mostly in the northwestern part of the state where there are numerous lakes and salmon-bearing rivers. And talk about an impressive lifestyle: Bald eagles instinctively return from northern Canada and the Arctic each spring to the same nest or nesting territory, and those nests are often four to six feet across and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds. The point of this feel-good story is that the American bald eagle, which appears on U.S. currency, on the official Great Seal of the United States (holding a bundle of arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other) and in too many numerous patriotic depictions to catalog, is alive and well as a result of government regulation. \"In some ways, [their recovery] was an easy success story,\" Ruth Milner, a regional biologist for Washington's Fish and Wildlife Commission, told The Herald newspaper. \"We identified their problem and removed it from the environment .\" Granted, most regulatory edicts aren't as clear-cut in their impact as the DDT ban, nor as beneficial to both industry and the public. But the backstory of how the bald eagle journeyed from near-extinction to full recovery is a cautionary tale for those who reflexively oppose all government regulations as being intrinsically bad. What would have been bad is if the majestic bird that for 235 years has served as our national symbol had perished from these United States.

(Hadas Parush/Flash90) Transportation Minister <mark>Yisrael Katz</mark> on Tuesday conducted the first test run of the new high-speed railway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The line is set to open on March 30, in about two and a half months. During the trip, <mark>Katz</mark> was accompanied by an entourage of Transportation Ministry officials, reporters and supporters. Speaking to the reporters, <mark>Katz</mark> said that he had decided to name the rail line the \"King David Line .\" The line \"will connect us to Yerushalayim and its history,\" <mark>Katz</mark> said. \"I decided to call it after King David, the conquerer of Yerushalayim, who turned the city into our eternal capital .\" Test trips that have been ongoing in recent months indicate that the predictions that the trip between Yerushalayim and Tel Aviv will take less than a half-hour are accurate, with the electric train achieving speeds of up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph). The 28-minute trip will include stops at Ben Gurion Airport, Modiin, and Shaar Hagay (where a large parking lot for commuters to Beit Shemesh will be set up). According to the Transport Ministry, the line will include five kilometers of bridges, including the longest bridge in Israel, at a length of almost three quarters of a mile. It is also the highest bridge, rising to almost 300 ft off the ground. The successful traversing of this bridge by the 1,200 ton train is an excellent sign that the project is sound from an engineering point of view, the Ministry said in a statement, adding that each pass of a train over the bridge will enable it to \"settle,\" strengthening its pylons and making it more sturdy. Besides the highest bridge, the railway will include the country's longest tunnel--7 miles. In addition, the railway's Jerusalem terminus, which will be about half a mile below ground, is one of the deepest commuter railway stations in the world. The line will begin operating just in time for Chol Hamo\u2019ed Pesach, and travel for the first three months of its operations will be free, <mark>Katz</mark> said Tuesday. \"The train will take 28 minutes to travel in either direction, and will guarantee further the status of Jerusalem, and further bring it to the country's business center, making it a more attractive place to live for families to live and start businesses. It will completely change the connection between Jerusalem and the rest of Israel,\" said <mark>Katz</mark>.

That all changed on Saturday against the Falcons. The Eagles' O-line dominated in the trenches and helped guide the Birds to a 15-10 win to advance to the NFC championship game. What was the line missing down the stretch? Stefen Wisniewski. The starting left guard missed a couple games with an ankle sprain, but returned for the regular season finale. Then, he just happened to have his best game as an Eagle in the divisional round game. It also happened to be the very first playoff game of his career. The 27-year-old Wisniewski had played in 107 regular season games without getting to the postseason--more than any other player on the active roster. When he got his first shot, he certainly made it count. Because Wisniewski didn't just do his job against the Falcons. He was dominant and made things happen all afternoon. Here's a closer look at some of his impressive plays against Atlanta: good-wiz1a. png This first play came on the Eagles' second drive of the game. It's 2nd-and-3 and Jay Ajayi is about to break off an 11-yard gain right behind the hole Wiz opens up. Wisniewski is about to get to the second level after the snap and find linebacker Deion Jones, who is a dynamic player, but is also just 222 pounds. good-wiz1b. png At the mesh point, Trey Burton has come across to take care of the defensive lineman, while Wiz is getting out in front on Jones. He doesn't just block him, he's about to push him back. good-wiz1c. png Ajayi finishes the run strong, picking up 11 pounds. He rode on the back of Wisniewski the whole way. Here's a different angle on the block to get an idea of how far Wisniewski drove Jones back. good-wiz1v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz2a. png These next three plays happened on consecutive downs. They were the last two plays of the first quarter and the first play of the second. Wiz got in a zone. On this one, Wiz is about to take on big Ahtyba Rubin, who weighs 310 pounds. good-wiz2b. png good-wiz2c. png On this zone read play, Ajayi sweeps left, so the entire defensive line shifts that way. Rubin goes with the play, but you can see where Wisniewski opens the hole. He makes it pretty easy on Ajayi. good-wiz2v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz3a. png The very next play is a screen, which has been a big part of the Eagles' offense when it gets clicking. \"The screen game has been something we've worked on the last couple of weeks,\" head coach Doug Pederson said, \"and it had to get better as the season wore on for us .\" On this play, Nelson Agholor is at the bottom of the screen. He's about to come in motion to create some space at the bottom of the screen. That's where Wisniewski is going to get out in front to clear a path for Ajayi. good-wiz3b. png Ajayi is working through the line and is about to settle in his spot to catch the pass from Nick Foles. Meanwhile, Wisniewski gets to the second level to find a hat to block. good-wiz3c. png Then, Wiz just bullies Jones again. He really used that size and strength edge to his advantage and didn't let the quicker Jones get around him. good-wiz3v. gif This was an important play because it showed just how big of a key the screen game could be. A little later you'll get to see Wiz's most impressive play. It came on a screen later in the game. good-wiz4a. png This is the first play of the second quarter. After Ajayi picked up nearly 50 yards in the first quarter, he's on the sideline getting a breather so LeGarrette Blount is on the field. He's gonna run right behind Wiz. good-wiz4b. png Just after the snap, Wiz lends some help to Jason Kelce, who is blocking big 346-pound tackle Dontari Poe. He then turns his attention to Jones, who has become his whipping boy at this point in the game. good-wiz4c. png At this point, Wisniewski has picked up his second block on the play and you can see where Blount is going to find the room to sneak ahead for an 8-yard gain. good-wiz4v. gif \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 good-wiz5a. png This next play comes about a minute later in the second quarter. The Eagles were running all over the Falcons but Foles was having trouble getting into rhythm. Pederson is going to find a way to get the ball into one of his playmaker's hands anyway. Agholor will take the ball on an end around and Wisniewksi is going to make it happen. good-wiz5b. png Lane Johnson swings around to get out in front of Agholor to provide a lead block, but it's Wisniewski who opens the hole. good-wiz5v. gif The Eagles gained 21 yards on this play to get them down the the 3-yard line. This led to their only touchdown of the game. good-wiz6a. png We went in chronological order, which allowed us to save the best for last. Wiz was incredible on this 32-yard screen pass in the fourth quarter. He actually blocks three guys on one play and forces one away from a tackle. Pederson caught the Falcons off guard by running a screen pass to the same side on two consecutive plays. He knew they wouldn't be expecting it. But it was still gutsy to run it on a key 3rd-and-7. good-wiz6b. png Just after the snap, Wisniewski gets enough of a block on Adrian Clayborn to give Foles plenty of time to deliver the ball. It's Wiz's job to let Clayborn through, but if he doesn't get a piece of him, the talented pass-rusher might have been able to blow up the play before it ever got a chance to develop. good-wiz6c. png good-wiz6d. png After getting the block at the line of scrimmage, Wiz gets out in front and takes care of the two defenders that get in his way. It's hard to see it with the photos, so take a look at his incredible play here: good-wiz6v. gif Pretty impressive, huh? This 32-yard screen pass got the Eagles across midfield and they eventually got close enough for <mark>Jake Elliott</mark> to kick a 21-yard field goal to put them up 15-10. It was a huge score because then the Falcons needed a touchdown instead of a field goal. \"I'll tell you, it was just set up perfectly for us and well-executed to have Wiz downfield and block one,\" Pederson said, \"but take out two, obviously helps the play .\" It took Wisniewski a while to prove himself this season. Even though he signed an extension this offseason, the Eagles seemed hesitant to give him the starting left guard spot. Isaac Seumalo was the starter going into the season and Chance Warmack was given the first shot to replace him when he struggled. Eventually, though, Wisniewski got the nod and has been playing at a really high level all season. The Eagles have three Pro Bowl or All-Pro linemen, but without Wisniewski this line just didn't seem to work. With him, they were dominant on Saturday.", "articleID": "2018011614_00753321_W", "names": {"Jake Elliott": ["Q22004199", "Q22277691", "Q27928464"]}}]
