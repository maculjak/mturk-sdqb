lautenberg has \"curable' stomach cancer n.j. sen. lautenberg has\" curable' stomach cancer (2/16/2010) new jersey's senior senator, frank lautenberg, has been diagnosed with curable stomach cancer. doctors they expect the 86-year-old to make a full recovery. dr. <mark>james holland</mark> of new york city's mount sinai medical center said the five-term democrat will undergo chemotherapy treatments. \"we expect a full and complete recovery for senator lautenberg. the senator will be treated with chemotherapy administered approximately every three weeks. we anticipate that he will receive between six and eight treatments, and in between treatments, the senator is expected to be back at work in the senate,\" dr. <mark>holland</mark> said. lautenberg began his treatment friday afternoon. \"i wouldn't be too surprised to soon hear how he's once again outpacing younger aides as they walk through u.s. capitol building,\" said state assembly speaker sheila y. oliver, a democrat. lautenberg told the star-ledger of newark late friday that he was \"feeling very good .\" lautenberg said he intends to return to washington to complete his term. \"my contract goes to 2014,\" he said. in the event that lautenberg, the second-oldest u.s. senator, is unable to serve, republican gov. chris christie has the option of naming a replacement, calling for a special election, or leaving the seat vacant until the next regular election. however, in the state's political circles friday, there wasn't open talk of a lautenberg resignation. politicians of both parties wished him a quick recovery. \"i'm encouraged by the positive statements of his doctors, and i am confident that frank will be back in the senate fighting for new jersey soon,\" said senate majority leader <mark>harry reid</mark>, d-nev. u.s. sen. robert menendez, also a democrat, called lautenberg \"new jersey tough .\" \"my thoughts and prayers are with sen. lautenberg,\" he said, \"and i look forward to fighting for new jersey families together with him for years to come .\" assemblyman jay webber, chairman of new jersey's republican state committee, said it's \"inappropriate\" to talk about filling the seat should lautenberg be unable to finish his term. <mark>patrick murray</mark>, a monmouth university political scientist, said a lautenberg resignation would mean that new jersey would have its first republican senator since nicholas f. brady served for eight months after being appointed to fill a vacancy. lautenberg replaced him. the state hasn't elected a republican u.s. senator since 1976. \"three of the four elected statewide offices in new jersey would be held by republicans, which would be an oddity,\" said <mark>murray</mark>, who doesn't think lautenberg would resign unless he had to. university of virginia political scientist larry sabato said another republican in the senate would make it harder for democrats to get the 60 votes they need to block a filibuster. there are now 59 democrats in the senate. \"it's that much harder to get two republican defections instead of one,\" he said. the liberal lautenberg, born in paterson, became prominent as a founder of the payroll services company automatic data processing long before he entered politics in 1982 with a successful run for the u.s. senate. he retired from politics and did not seek re-election in 2000, but returned two years later as a last-minute replacement in a senate race when sen. robert torricelli dropped out. he was re-elected in 2008, winning easily in a race in which his age never materialized as a major issue. he is a major supporter of gun control and a big critic of the tobacco industry. he's also active in transportation issues. lately, he has criticized the transportation security administration over a disruptive security breach at newark liberty international airport. lymphoma is an immune system cancer, and the b-cell form is a type of the non-hodgkin's lymphoma that strikes more than 65,000 people in the u.s. annually. there are multiple subtypes of the b-cell form, with widely varying treatments and prognoses. lymphomas can strike in lymph tissue anywhere in the body, such as the lymph nodes--and the stomach contains lymphoid tissue. lautenberg was taken to the hospital monday after his office said he fell at his cliffside park home. the office said tuesday the senator was treated for a bleeding ulcer. doctors believe that diagnosis was also accurate.", "articleID": "2010022002_00048796_W", "names": {"Patrick Murray":

trick treats bc boston college has to offer in the postseason, it could be quite a finish for the eagles. taking on a northeastern squad that had defeated it friday night at matthews arena, bc delivered a performance as dominant as you'll ever see, routing the huskies, 7-1, yesterday behind the first career hat trick and 100th career point by junior center <mark>brian gibbons</mark> of braintree. \"they were great,\" a stunned nu coach greg cronin said. \"i've been at this for five years now, and that's as thorough and as consistent an effort as i've seen from a team in five years. and then when you add the talent and the speed they have, it was like they were on steroids, and we just couldn't match it .\" (bc) wanted to win every battle from the opening faceoff to the end. their game plan was very visible: it started with winning battles, hunting pucks down with passion, and we couldn't match it. they did it for 60 minutes. our (defenders) were under assault for most of the game. \"aside from <mark>gibbons</mark>' three goals (nos. 12, 13 and 14), bc got single tallies from pat mullane (no. 7), chris kreider of boxford (no. 9), cam atkinson (no. 18) and <mark>jimmy hayes</mark> of dorchester (no. 7). <mark>ben smith</mark> had two assists. eagles freshman goalie parker milner (22 saves) improved to 7-2-0. in the huskies' 3-2 win friday, 6-foot-5 nu goalie chris rawlings had an outstanding 38-save showing. he was good again yesterday but would have needed a lot more saves than he had in the weekend opener to give the huskies a chance - as the eagles (18-10-2, 13-8-2 hockey east) posted a 50-23 advantage in shots .\" our offensive zone play was outstanding, \"bc coach <mark>jerry york</mark> said .\" we cycled the puck really well and maintained possession. \"the eighth-ranked eagles were simply terrific in every facet of play. they played very strong defense (with <mark>york</mark> praising defensemen patrick wey, brian dumoulin and philip samuelsson), and turned it into lightning-fast transitions. the eagles got pucks deep and forechecked like crazy, keeping the attack alive for long stretches with their cycle. they also got lots of traffic and pucks to the goalmouth of northeastern (16-13-1, 11-11-1). moving the puck extremely well, bc generated a few easy, open-net tap-ins .\" the puck wasn't staying on anyone's stick too long, \"said <mark>gibbons</mark>, who matched his career-high with four points .\" no one was selfish. everyone was just: get it and move it to the guy who's open. \"<mark>gibbons</mark>' big night began with a high-speed dash up ice and a shot from the right hashmark that beat rawlings low to the far side. that was the only goal of a first period in which bc (18-6 edge in shots) should have had more. by
