Lt.-Gov. <mark>Janet Austin</mark> read the NDP government's speech from the throne, Feb. 12. (<mark>Tom</mark> Fletcher/Black Press). B.C. Premier <mark>John Horgan</mark> set the agenda for his government's spring session Tuesday with a throne speech packed with promises to hold down ferry and electricity costs, while promising legislation to regulate event ticket sales and payday lenders. Canada's high cellphone bills are another priority for the province, according to the speech read in the B.C. legislature by Lt. Gov. <mark>Janet Austin</mark>. But don't expect relief right away; changes this year include improving \"billing transparency\" and doing another of the NDP government's familiar consultation rounds, while federal law controls much of the wireless industry. \"Your government will give consumers the tools they need to get the least expensive possible service and encourage the federal government to deliver more affordable cellphone options for people,\" the speech says. New rules are on the way for live event ticket sellers, including a ban on mass ticket-buying software. Payday lenders will see a new cap on the fees they can charge. The latest review of money laundering and its effect on real estate is to be completed, with recommendations the speech says \"will provide a basis for immediate action to close loopholes and defend against criminal activity .\" Other goals for 2019 include establishing new Class A provincial parks and creating a Chinese-Canadian museum, along with an upgrade of the Royal B.C. Museum in Victoria. Land purchased on Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, the Okanagan and Kootenays is to be given the province's highest park protection. A freeze on B.C. Ferries fare increases for major routes and discounts on minor and northern routes are to continue for a second year. The speech promises to carry on with rental market changes recommended late last year by an MLA task force. This could include legislation to prevent strata councils from banning rentals. Action is also promised to speed up new rental housing projects and deliver \"more efficient and effective project approvals .\" In industrial development, the speech promises legislative action to advance the LNG Canada project. Before that massive project can begin operation, a dispute with dissident hereditary chiefs of the Wet's uwet' en First Nation in northwest B.C. on the key natural gas pipeline route has to be resolved, and the province must remove the liquefied natural gas income tax put in place by the previous B.C.

The 65-year-old took to Instagram on Wednesday evening to mark joining the ABC series with a set of photos that sent the platform a reminder: this blonde might be a little more advanced in years, but she's still got it. Christie's snaps came straight from a red carpet moment backed by walls with the competition series' logo. Christie was photographed looking ready to bust some moves by virtue of her raised knee and stretched-out leg, but this update seemed to be more than just a reminder that Christie will be landing on screens in mid-September. The Sports Illustrated alum was flaunting her killer legs in a skimpy mini dress with polka dot motifs--suffice to say that this mother can pull off a floaty little number like the 20-somethings. The star's legs were looking sensational in a pair of strappy and glittery silver heels, with fans appearing to see as much muscle as they did style. A sense of humor is never amiss with Christie. Those paying attention to the model's caption will have picked up on her joking age reference. View this post on Instagram Hey Everybody!

Brooke Shields is no stranger to the highs and lows of parenting. The actress and her husband, Chris Henchy, have two daughters, 14-year-old Rowan and 11-year-old Grier. Over the years, Shields has been incredibly open about her experiences as a mother--from her battle with postpartum depression (the subject of her 2005 memoir Down Came the Rain) to her parenting rules to her hopes for her children. In honor of her birthday this week, we've compiled some of her most honest and touching quotes about parenthood. On her fears as a mother \"I'm terrified that I'm not really understanding who they are, and that maybe one day they won't feel like they can come to me--that I will somehow fail them...I don't know if you overcome it. The way I try to get through it is by talking to other moms. Either someone will do something that's seemingly worse, and I'll think,\" At least I didn't do that,' but then someone will do something better and I think, \"I've gotta learn that, I've got to do that instead!\" ' On her advice for new parents \"Don't be afraid to ask for help and don't be too hard on yourself.

It's so heart-wrenching! And then you realize: It's so heart-wrenching. That's why I did it to myself .\" On her decision to speak out about her postpartum depression \"Because nobody was talking about postpartum depression, and women were suffering all the time. I wanted to educate women who were suffering and families of women who were suffering .\" <mark>Mark Avery</mark> / Reuters On being a celebrity parent \"You know, the only reason why it seems like it's more challenging is because it's in the public eye to a certain extent and it's scrutinized, but that is such a minor percentage.

My new thing is not screaming and not screaming back at them. I would engage in an absolute fight, and my husband would say,\" What's wrong with you? Why are you fighting with them?'...Chris, my husband, calls it FOFO--Find Out Before You Freak Out. So before I react, I'm now trying to just count to 10. \"On how becoming a mom changed her life\" It took having a child, for me to feel like I belong, that I'm normal. \"A post shared by Brooke Shields (@ brookeshields) on May 14, 2017 at 12:46 pm PDT On embracing imperfection as a parent\" I would have thought that I would have become one of those parents--just because it's my nature to be such a perfectionist--that anything falling short, I would have seen as a failure. But something has happened to me over the past few years--it's not Zen, believe me, I'm not at all Zen--but I'm so appreciative of even the chaos. It's not about being perfect; it's about being engaged. \"On work-life balance\" I had a moment where I realized I was spending all of my free time, which is so little, doing events and going to charities. I wasn't putting my kids to bed at all. When you're doing theatre it's almost impossible to put them to bed and it really threw me for a loop. I have to work so when I'm not working, it's easy to get caught up and say, oh, I'll do that charity or I'll do that thing for you. And your kids are with the babysitter and it's heartbreaking. \"On how having kids changed her attitude toward her career\" Being a mom puts the rejection of being an actress in perspective. \"Bruce Glikas via Getty Images On mom peers\" I get support from other moms and my therapist. It is only as important to connect with mom peers as it gives you comfort. If and when it gets competitive, it becomes toxic. \"On how parenthood shifts your priorities\" However, having my first daughter obliterated me. It took away all my power. All of a sudden I was experiencing something so foreign, which I had no response for. I had no resources to rely on. It was not simply about being the good girl, or being polite, or doing my job. A little human being was involved. \"On the joys of raising children\" What I love most is being able to wake up in the morning with these innocent and truthful little people. \"Suggest a correction Caroline Bologna Parents Editor, HuffPost MORE: U.S. News Arts And Entertainment Parenting Postpartum Depression Brooke Shields Close"}, {"articleID": "2017053007_00391172_W", "names": {"Chris Pratt": ["Q503706", "Q5107796"]}, "date": "2017-05-30", "url": "http://thecourierexpress.com/lifestyle/entertainment/geoffrey-rush-originality-has-been-key-to-pirates-of-the/article_9650c6f2-9985-5a97-a05b-ebf94562f1ce.html", "content": "Geoffrey Rush thinks the \"Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise was wise to avoid stereotypes.
