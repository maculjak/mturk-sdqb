(AP)--People who kill or seriously injure police dogs in Florida soon could face tougher penalties after the Senate unanimously passed a bill inspired by the shooting death of a canine named Fang. \"This bill has been a roller coaster of emotions,\" said Sen. Aaron Bean. \"Fang was executed .\" Fang was a 3-year-old German shepherd at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. He was fatally shot as officers chased a 17-year-old carjacking suspect. Bean said he decided to sponsor the bill after learning the penalty for killing the dog was a maximum of five years in prison. The bill would make the crime a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. \"The double hurt came not only in losing the animal, but we discovered the penalty for harming an animal...was only a third degree felony,\" Bean said. \"It was just sad .\" Bean noted that just last weekend a police K-9 was shot in Pinellas County after a traffic stop, though the dog is expected to survive. In making his case for the bill, he turned to Republican Sen. <mark>Tom Wright</mark>, a former Rochester, Minnesota, police officer who was assigned a K-9. He told stories about two incidents when his K-9, Officer Denver, stopped an armed suspect he was pursuing. \"Just two examples of I probably wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for this dog,\" <mark>Wright</mark> said. \"These are officers, they just happen to have four legs .\" The increased penalties would also apply to anyone who seriously injures or kills a police horse or canines used by fire departments and search and rescue teams. A companion House bill is ready to be considered by the full chamber after unanimous approval in each of its committee stops.

Weinstein and his brother founded Miramax which has been responsible for successful films such as Pulp Fiction and Good Will Hunting. He has received numerous awards for his work and has been active in issues such as AIDS and Juvenile Diabetes. He was, undoubtedly, a Hollywood powerhouse who had the connections to make or break careers. Sexual assault is rampant around the world and I have long been an active voice speaking out against it and advocating for the victims. I am in no way minimizing what any woman suffers in my comments regarding this particular case but I have some serious concerns and I think they are concerns that should be shared. Lately, there has been a whole stream of public figures who stand accused of various sexual assaults. Some are hopeful that this signals a new willingness to expose these atrocities and that they represent our commitment to draw a line in the sand and say \"No more .\" We seem to circumvent the who legal process meant to determine guilt and jump straight to judgement. Guilt appears to be amplified by the public lives of the accused. Is it easier for us to comment on a life that we already feel we have a right to because we see them in our own homes on our media devices and on the news? It appears to at least polarize the accusers as legitimate and the accused as guilty. No-one seems to worry about questioning what we read and hear. A trial and its outcome are irrelevant. As long as you have Gloria Allred on one side of the microphone, the truth is irrelevant. The story never dies and the accused, even if innocent, will never completely recover. Take away the celebrity cases and looking to regular court in your own cities and communities and you will find a whole slew of sexual abuse allegations being made against, mainly men. In family court, those allegations are too frequently proven to be wrong or without substance. The man stands accused and those who are willing to lie in order to punish or hurt, or even sometimes to gain financial reward, are suddenly in the driver's seat. They have a story with elaborately made up facts. The accused now has to prove a negative. They have to prove that they did not abuse the \"pretend victim .\" These pretend victims are believed and supported BECAUSE there are real victims somewhere and their suffering is real. These false accusers, who themselves should be punished to the full extent of the law, use the very real stories of legitimate victims to further their lies. No-one should be championing these women. No-one should be supporting them. THEY make it harder for the real victims because once these liars are found out, they make it harder for real victims to come forward. They make it harder for people to believe them and they make it less likely that they will ever find justice, safety or peace. Isn't this the real foundation of all women's rights? We will no longer allow ourselves to be abused? We will stand up and speak out and we demand justice? Violence against women, especially sexual violence MUST end? Then WHY are women using the abuse of women as a weapon to \"get even\" or to \"make someone pay?\" Now amplify the accusation to the public arena and you have people possibly motivated for the same reasons but more. Now there is a quality of blackmail in taking it public. You and I probably do not care what is happening in a city on the other side of our countries where \"John Citizen\" has just been accused but we are possibly going to weigh in on \"John Celebrity .\" These people also are involved in issues, they speak out. They can expose people and their business practices. They may know about political issues and personalities. They may have done something to anger the wrong people or not done what they were supposed to do. The accusations made against <mark>Donald Trump</mark> during the last election are a perfect example. All of a sudden the man is accused of several instances of sexual abuse and yet none of them seem to have followed through and he was never found guilty or even charged. It seems like it all might just have been part of an attempt to keep him from being elected. Despite there being no real proof, many people still believe it as if there had been a conviction. All I am saying is there are plenty of reasons for people to stand up and make accusations without them ever being true. The \"pretend victims\" are using the accusation of sexual abuse for personal gain. I have heard some people insist there are too many women coming forward for Weinstein's charges to not be true. I hear people swayed by the star quality of some of the accusers. The bigger the star the more we seem willing to believe in their moral integrity, even when there is no evidence of a star having any morals or integrity. Is Weinstein guilty? I have no idea. Just because I state that I am not loading up my own supply of stones to throw does not mean I am supporting him or that I believe he is innocent. It means I don't know. None of us can say that we do. But here is where I am most uneasy. I see these women, huge stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie and well-known stars like Rose McGowan and Ashely Judd, coming forward. According to Entertainment Weekly, there are more than 40 women to date. There are others who have not claimed abuse but who say they knew, like Jane Fonda. Many of these women are role models, active in various Women's groups. Some of them are considered role models for the other actresses. None of them spoke out? None of them. Not the abused, not the ones who heard about it, not the ones who saw it. This is reported to have been going on for years. They were abused and then they were silent. They did not seek help. They did not seek justice. They did not stand up and use their positions of leadership among women to speak the truth of their own experience and lead by example. I find myself asking why. The only answer is that ultimately, they all chose their careers overcoming forward. If they said anything, they would never work again because Weinstein was that powerful. I accept that it might have been incredibly painful. I accept that they may have been that damaged. But then, I have to ask, why did they stay? Why continue to work in an industry that operates on that level, with people who see and know and say nothing? Why risk further abuse in an industry with a man so powerful that he had great influence over their careers? They stayed and continued to work and accept the money, and uphold the image and the fa\u00e7ade of Hollywood. They played the game. They were part of it. In making their choice they spit in the face of all the other victims which many of them heard about and talked with over the years. They did not protect them. They spit in the face of all the women who struggle to come forward in their own lives because the very real consequences of doing that might mean the loss of their families, and even worse violence, possibly death. The fame of many of these women offered them a protection that the average woman does not have. Their fame offered them a voice that could have saved many by identifying their abuser who, by their accounts, was growing bolder, but also by setting an example for other women to follow. Instead, Ashley Judd stood and insisted she was a \"nasty woman\" and assured all women they should be like her and fight against all these injustices. She was happy to hurl accusations at <mark>Trump</mark> when again, she had no personal knowledge as to whether any of those accusations were true, but the one truth she could have spoken with complete confidence went unspoken. She was willing to destroy someone else's life based on a possible lie but she was not willing to stand up for her own truth. I am sure there are many sexual predators in Hollywood, of course, there are, they are a group of people like any other group of people. Our world is filled with both violence and sexual depravity. Predators exist in practically every group you can name. The disregard for one another, the disrespect, the hate, is not about being black, or Muslim, or a woman, it is just the way many people now see the world. We are so bolstered in our sense of entitlement, our \"rights,\" that we now see other people as just tools that we can use and abuse as our whims and appetites might direct us. And while the predators should be exposed and stand to face their crimes, there are many other who should stand with them. In order for them to continue and to feed the appetites of the predator, there has to be a huge crowd of the people that know what is going on and do nothing. Sadly, in this case, that crowd included his victims. Hollywood has no-one to blame for the decay that I believe is going to destroy all of them, but themselves. \"Some people think they can find satisfaction in good food, fine clothes, lively music, and sexual pleasure. However, when they have all these things, they are not satisfied. They realize happiness is not simply having their material needs met. Thus, society has set up a system of rewards that go beyond material goods. These include titles, social recognition, status, and political power, all wrapped up in a package called self-fulfilment. Attracted by these prizes and goaded on by social pressure, people spend their short lives tiring body and mind to chase after these goals. Perhaps this gives them the feeling that they have achieved something in their lives, but in reality, they have sacrificed a lot in life. They can no longer see, hear, act, feel, or think from their hearts. Everything they do is dictated by whether it can get them social gains. In the end, they've spent their lives following other people's demands and never lived a life of their own. How different is this from the life of a slave or a prisoner?\" Liezi Advertisements Like this: Like Loading...Related"}, {"articleID": "2017100923_00432604_W", "names": {"Cam Newton": ["Q5024850", "Q5024852", "Q591678"], "Rick Williams": ["Q16152041", "Q19518930", "Q28421787", "Q42321991", "Q7331860"]}, "date": "2017-10-09", "url": "http://6abc.com/sports/second-grader-calls-out-cam-newton-on-twitter-/2513356/", "content": "BREAKING NEWS Fatal crash in Northeast closes major thoroughfare Full Story Email share share tweet email BREAKING NEWS ESPN: Joel Embiid OKs five-year, $148M deal with Sixers Full Story Email share share tweet email BREAKING NEWS Suspect in custody for murder of Philly activist Full Story Email share share tweet email BREAKING NEWS Names released of 4 killed in Gloucester Twp. crash Full Story Email share share tweet email SPORTS Local second grader creates stir calling out <mark>Cam Newton</mark> on twitter Email share share tweet email EMBED </> More Videos <iframe width = \"476\" height = \"267\" src = \"http: //6abc.com/video/embed/? pid=2513362\" frameborder = \"0\" allowfullscreen> </ iframe> Local second grader creates social media stir calling out <mark>Cam Newton</mark>: Jamie Apody reports on Action News at 6 p.m., October 9, 2017 (WPVI) WPVI By Jamie Apody Monday, October 09, 2017 07:27 PM PHILADELPHIA (WPVI)--It was the off-the-cuff comment heard round the world. \"It's funny to hear a female talk about routes,\" said <mark>Cam Newton</mark>, during an interview on October 4. But it was not seen as funny to millions of football fans who happen to be female. One of these fans, 7-year-old Reese Emanuele took <mark>Newton</mark> to task on twitter. Reese created a video explaining routes, which her dad posted to his twitter account on Friday. Since it has been posted, Reese's video has been retweeted almost 4000 times. On Monday, the second grader from Clinton, N.J. paid a visit to Action News, talking a little football with <mark>Rick Williams</mark>. She even sat down to speak with someone who knows a thing or two about pass routes, former Eagles Quarterback Ron Jaworski. She said she hopes the takeaway from her video is that people realize girls can know a thing or two about sports, just like boys. Reese's dad Eric said he learned the game of football from his mother and that is what drove him to post the video .------Send a breaking news alert to Action News Report a correction or typo Learn more about the 6abc family of apps Related Topics: sports Action News Sports Email share share tweet email (Copyright \u00a9 2017 WPVI-TV.

It was not stated exactly how late <mark>Tan</mark> had been studying. His lawyer also declined to reveal <mark>Tan</mark>'s occupation when asked by reporters, although he was described as a \"hardworking academic\" in court. On July 8 last year, at about 9am, <mark>Tan</mark> was driving along Lavender Street towards Republic Avenue when he collided into Chua Boon Huat who was crossing the road more than 50m from a pedestrian crossing. <mark>Tan</mark>, however, had a clear view straight ahead and the victim was in plain sight from some distance away, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Charis Low noted, adding that he should have had ample time to see Chua. He failed to do so because he did not keep a proper lookout. DPP Low also pointed out that <mark>Tan</mark> was driving at a speed of 63km/h at the point of impact, having increased his speed from 59km/h to 63km/h in the immediate five seconds before the impact. The speed limit for the stretch of road was 60km/h. Chua suffered head and collarbone injuries as a result of the crash and had to be warded in <mark>Tan</mark> Tock Seng Hospital for 19 days. In view of the \"grievous harm\" caused, DPP Low had asked the court to impose a one-week jail sentence, arguing that <mark>Tan</mark>'s \"sleepy driving\" increased his culpability, since he posed an increased danger to other road users. If he had been alert, he would have noticed the victim crossing the road, she reiterated. While <mark>Tan</mark>'s lawyer, Pang Khin Wee, agreed that a custodial sentence is warranted, he sought to get a \"discount\" on the one-week sentence the prosecution wanted, pointing out that his client had refrained from driving since the accident and is \"unlikely to reoffend\". \"He is full of potential for rehabilitation and will do a lot of good to society as a doctor in the future,\" he told District Judge Carol <mark>Ling Feng</mark> Yeng. Pang also said that <mark>Tan</mark>--who had been driving for four to five years before the accident--took responsibility for his actions and emerged from his vehicle \"in a split second\" to get help for the victim. A passing ambulance at the site of the accident attended to Chua. <mark>Tan</mark> had written an apology letter to Chua, Pang said, noting that it took care of the victim's \"mental well-being\" as it accorded the victim \"closure\" to what had transpired. The lawyer added that the man's medical expenses were covered by <mark>Tan</mark>'s insurance firm. These proved <mark>Tan</mark>'s \"genuine remorse\" , Pang said. The lawyer questioned DPP Low's \"sleepy driving\" characterisation of <mark>Tan</mark>, adding that he knows of people who can function with two to three hours of sleep. \"(My client) is a hardworking academic,\" he stressed. In response, DPP Low said that she was referring to Pang's mitigation plea, which stated that the accident was caused by a \"momentary lapse\" , partially caused by a lack of sleep. <mark>Tan</mark> pleaded guilty to one charge of a negligent act endangering human life and causing grievous hurt to Chua. He could have been sentenced to up to two years in jail, or fined up to S $5,000, or both."}, {"articleID": "2017061123_00653842_W", "names": {"Tom King": ["Q23664009", "Q27139397", "Q3530763", "Q3992491", "Q52892734", "Q55635982", "Q58316386", "Q7816471", "Q7816473"], "Jim Gordon": ["Q1334162", "Q6195271"], "Paul Dini": ["Q3371079", "Q636303"]}, "date": "2017-06-11", "url": "http://www.cbr.com/catwoman-batman-team-ups/", "content": "Share On Facebook Tweet Pint It Email Comment SPOILER WARNING: The following story contains spoilers for Batman #24, on sale now. Catwoman and Batman's love affair has filled decades of comic book pages with both romance and butt-kicking. No matter what DC timeline the two have tangled in, they always end up teaming - up in cowl and claws to overcome the enemies of Gotham City. The two haven't always seen eye to eye over the years, but Catwoman has consistently been one of the most important and reliable members of the Bat-Family. Despite the majority of their time together spent hiding behind masks as they flirt and fight across Gotham's rooftops, Selina Kyle is one of the few people who truly understands Bruce Wayn e and vice versa. RELATED: 15 CRAZIEST Things From Batman: Knightfall After Catwoman first clawed her way into Batman's life in 1940's Batman #1, their relationship has been a vehicle in which to discover new and surprising elements of both Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's character. On the surface, the crusading vigilante and the thrill-seeking burglar couldn't be more different. But as their feelings grew through countless adventures, the Bat and the Cat learned how perfect for one another they actually were. Writer <mark>Tom King</mark> has been exploring still newer facets of their complex relationship throughout Batman \"Rebirth .\" In honor of Batman finally popping \"the question\" to Catwoman in Batman #24, CBR has collected some of the very best Catwoman/Batman team-ups! 15. REBIRTH Catwoman has been a major player in <mark>Tom King</mark>'s \"Rebirth\" Batman title since 2016. In \"I Am Suicide,\" Batman assembles a crack suicide squad of his own, including Catwoman, to break into Santa Prisca prison and steal the Psycho Pirate from Bane in order to help heal Gotham Girl's damaged psyche. Catwoman, who is on death row for killing 237 people, pretends to betray Batman for Bane, but that ploy turns out to be a double blind and the Cat breaks Bane's back just as Bane is about to crush Batman. When Bane returns to Gotham for revenge in \"I Am Bane,\" Catwoman once again proves herself to be Batman's most unpredictable ally, as she pretends to be kidnapped by Bane only to escape and free Bane's other Bat-Family hostages. 14. ROOFTOPS In Batman #14's \"Rooftops\" arc, Batman reveals to Catwoman as they smooch it out along Gotham's harbor that due to Bruce's deal with Amanda Waller, Catwoman will only receive a lifetime sentence without parole instead of the death penalty. How romantic! Batman needs to take Catwoman, in but instead, Selina convinces him to let them have one more night together. The two lovers take down a sling of minor villains like Clock <mark>King</mark> and Kite Man before passionately making love and fondly reminiscing of the first time they met one another. In a quaint and emotional callback to their storied history, Bruce references Batman #1 while Selina recalls their encounter in Frank Miller's \"Year One .\" Catwoman being Catwoman, she tells Bruce to chase her one last time and escapes in the early morning hours. She later saves Batman's life and the ensuing events help clear Catwoman's name as she actually took the fall for her friend and fellow orphan, Holly. 13. HUSH 2002's \"Hush\" written by Jeph Loeb saw a mysterious enemy from Bruce Wayne's past return to haunt the Dark Knight while also featuring an onslaught of classic Batman villains. Batman and Catwoman get hot and heavy pretty quickly after Bruce frees Selina from Poison Ivy's control. Bruce finally decides he should fully trust Selina and even reveals his secret identity to Catwoman in Batman #615! The two would team-up to fight not only Ivy, but also Harley Quinn, the Joker, and Superman as well throughout \"Hush .\" After defeating a faux Jason Todd reveals the arc's true mastermind, Bruce's childhood friend, Hush (a.k.a. Thomas Eliot) Batman's trust in himself is shaken. Was their love just a form of Ivy's control? Scarecrow's fear toxin? Can Bruce keep Selina safe? The Bat and the Cat end things. For now. 12. THE LONG HALLOWEEN Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's iconic noir masterpiece \"The Long Halloween\" tells the story of Harvey Dent's fall as Batman, <mark>Gordon</mark>, and Dent attempt to take down the Falcone crime family early in Batman's career. Catwoman has her own reasons for wanting to bring down Falcone and her information leads to the destruction of the mob's secret stash of dough worth tens of millions of dollars. Throughout the story, Batman attempts to not only end Falcone, but also to understand Catwoman's seemingly personal connection to the crime family. Two-Face, a.k.a. Harvey Dent, finally murders Falcone at his estate flanked by the \"freaks\" and villains of Gotham, including Catwoman. The Cat attempts to fend off his daughter Sofia, but the enraged mob heiress is horribly injured after she plummets out the window. \"The Long Halloween\" and its sequels also imply that Selina is Carmine's illegitimate child. 11. FOREVER EVIL The 2013 DC crossover event \"Forever Evil\" saw the heroes and villains of Earth Prime attacked and brought low by the machinations of the Crime Syndicate and their allies. After the Justice League gets thoroughly owned by the Syndicate and imprisoned by Deathstorm within the Firestorm Matrix, Batman takes Catwoman to the Batcave as they prepare a counterattack in Forever Evil #4. Catwoman and Batman soon find themselves in for the fight of their lives after running into Lex Luthor's own team of villains as well as Power Ring's gang of baddies. Luthor teams-up with the Cat and the Bat and this new \"Injustice League\" confronts the Syndicate and the \"Mazahs\" - shouting Alexander Luthor at the Watchtower in a bloody final battle, defeating the Crime Syndicate for the time being. 10. HEART OF HUSH Written by <mark>Paul Dini</mark> and illustrated by Dustin Nguyen, Hush makes a horrific return in \"Heart of Hush\" by kidnapping Catwoman and surgically removing her heart. Selina Kyle is kept alive on a series of machines while Batman pursues Hush to defeat his childhood friend and secure Catwoman's heart. Their battle spills over to the Batcave and, in a shocking twist, Elliot reveals that he's performed plastic surgery on his face in order to resemble Bruce Wayne. Fortunately, Batman, Robin, and Nightwing overcome Hush and are able to save Selina's life. In Detective Comics #850, Bruce visits Selina in the hospital and tells her that he'll always love her. Catwoman takes her revenge on Hush by stealing his entire fortune and enjoys a well-deserved vacation on Thomas Elliot's dime. 9. BATMAN: PREY \"Prey,\" which consisted of Legends of the Dark Knight #11 through #15, explored more of the characters' early history. At the story's start, Batman is still a very controversial figure in Gotham and is distrusted by the police force and the public. Dr. Hugo Strange becomes a G.C.P.D. consultant and begins to unravel the mystery behind Batman's identity. However, while chatting with a female mannequin, Strange quickly reveals that he's actually a highly intelligent, but extremely weird, wacko who is obsessed with Batman. Meanwhile, Catwoman is accused by the media of being Batman's partner in crime, so the two do not meet on the best of terms. Catwoman bashes Batman with a pipe after being attacked by Strange's hypnotized, faux-Batman replacement. That's what qualifies as a fun date on the streets of Gotham. 8. BATMAN: TERROR A sequel to \"Prey,\" Legends of the Dark Knight #137 begins the \"Terror\" arc which sees Hugo Strange return from the dead to torment Batman with the help of Scarecrow. It also tries really, really hard to make every single part of the story burst with sex appeal. Strange becomes the chief psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum and breaks Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. the Scarecrow, out while Batman is thoroughly schooled by Catwoman after attempting to bring her in for robbery. When Bruce returns home, he finds Alfred taken hostage by Strange and that the good doctor believes Bruce Wayne is Batman! Unfortunately, the reinvigorated Scarecrow has other plans and blackmails Selina into luring Bruce back to the place it all began: the Monarch Theater. Catwoman decides she'd rather bet on Batman to take Scarecrow down and her carefully placed homing device leads the Dark Knight to the fear-mongering psychopath. 7. ONLY TAKES A NIGHT Writer Ed Brubaker's Catwoman #32 opens with Selina Kyle's return to Gotham City. Almost immediately upon her arrival Batman shows up to once again confess his feelings for her. Selina convinces Bruce to take a \"night off\" and they share dinner and a movie like a normal couple for once. Bruce is so happy to find Selina alive after all this time that he actually almost breaks down in tears. #32 focuses on exploring a time when Bruce and Selina are able to have a healthy and happy relationship. It shows how their feelings for one another help to mitigate the pain from the challenges from the war against crime in Gotham City. Selina has, for a moment at least, balance and fulfillment in her life and relationship with Bruce, both in and out of the mask. 6. A TOWN ON THE NIGHT After the conclusion of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths,\" Batman #392 opens with Catwoman and Batman teaming-up to stop some run-of-the-mill baddies as Selina is still convincing the G.C.P.D. that she's reformed since her jewel-snatching days. To celebrate, Batman takes Catwoman for a bite at his favorite late-night spot: the back alley of an Italian restaurant. But since it's Gotham City and no one can get through a meal without a crime being committed, Catwoman and Batman apprehend an assassin who whacks someone at the restaurant. A pattern begins to form after this, as everywhere they go there's crime to be stopped! Finally, they show up at <mark>Jim Gordon</mark>'s office and present the apprehended criminals--and a mountain of pizza--as a gift to the police commissioner. 5. THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD \"The Autobiography of Bruce Wayne!\" tells the tale of when Bruce first fell in love with Selina Kyle back in The Brave and the Bold #197. In Bruce's memoirs, he even refers to Selina as \"his wife!\" Plagued by the haunting memories of all the loves lost in his crusade as Batman and unable to contact any of his crime-fighting allies in a pinch, Bruce seeks out the help of Catwoman in order to apprehend Scarecrow. Batman and Catwoman prove themselves a spectacular crime-fighting duo as they overcome a series of challenges set forth by Scarecrow all the while realizing how powerful their connection really is, and how they can escape their pain and loneliness together. After suffering a blast of fear toxin that causes Batman to be afraid of cats and Catwoman of bats, Selina breaks the poison's grip by revealing her face, which prompts Bruce to do the same. 4. SECRET ORIGINS DC Superstars #17 threw some new secret origins at readers including the Huntress, daughter of Earth-2's Batman and Catwoman! In this universe, Catwoman had willingly surrendered to the G.C.P.D. and served out a prison sentence as punishment for her crimes. When she was finally freed and totally not scarred by prison, Bruce Wayne was waiting with open arms. Bruce's marriage to Selina was a happy and fulfilling one and his crusade as the Batman even took a backseat once their daughter, Helena, was born. The fairy tale ends when a criminal from Selina's past blackmails her after revealing evidence that she murdered someone as Catwoman. Knowing that Bruce would never forgive her, she agrees to take on one last job. Selina's accidental death during Bruce's fight with the criminal inspires Helena to become the Huntress. 3. HEAT A cat-costumed serial killer with Wolverine-like claws stalks the streets of Gotham during a heat wave in Legends of the Dark Knight #46, so Batman reluctantly teams up with Catwoman to stop him. Selina springs into action once she hears that the media is suggesting a connection to her own alter-ego, and soon the cat-killer begins targeting young women. If that isn't enough, <mark>Jim Gordon</mark> punches the racist mayor in the face and race riots start to rage across the city because of the serial killer. Selina, wearing revealing civilian clothes, lures the killer to attack her in the park where she and Batman send him scampering to the Gotham City Zoo and finally take him down at the Miss Gotham Beauty Pageant. Afterwards, Batman makes a big to-do about their partnership officially being over forever, but everyone knows how serious he was about that! 2. BATMAN INC.. After Batman and Catwoman steal a weapon called Project X from a Leviathan compound they travel to Japan (Selina under a pseudonym) to train Mr. Unknown as a Japanese Batman. But after finding Mr. Unknown murdered, Bruce takes on Unknown's protege to stop Lord Death Man from killing his way through Japan's superhero population. Catwoman is instrumental in Lord Death Man's defeat...by running him over in a truck. Thanks to their teamwork, Bruce's mission to spread his vision of Batman Inc. to Japan in issues #1 and #2 is a success. Selina's side mission in Japan--stealing the Crown Jewels of Poseidon--is foiled when Bruce reveals that the jewels have liquefied, as they cannot survive above a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres. Sure. Makes sense, Brucie. 1. DETECTIVE COMICS In Detective Comics #569 Catwoman is still trying to convince Batman that she's reformed, even turning in the members of her former gang when they continue to commit crimes. The Joker lures Batman, Catwoman, and Jason Todd, a.k.a. Robin, into a trap before capturing and torturing Selina Kyle. She's no damsel in distress, however. \"Recalibrated\" and suffering from amnesia due to the Joker's torture device, Catwoman attacks Batman. This \"new\" Selina turns on the Joker too and seems to have completely forgotten her feelings for the Dark Knight. Joker gets a few nasty cracks to the jaw from Batman for that, as the infuriated Bruce laments about how the likes of the Joker have cost him every woman he's ever loved. Doubtful, Dark Knight, because although Selina returns to her criminal ways, she won't be out of your love-life for long!

Sweeney has taken the luggage of movie stars and shaken hands with every U.S. president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama. Visitors from around the world have had their photos taken with him, often after he's told them where to catch the cable car and how to get to Fisherman's Wharf. \"It's one of the best jobs in San Francisco,\" says Sweeney, 62, as a cable car clanks by. \"Working outside a landmark hotel, cable cars come by every nine minutes, it doesn't get much better than that .\" The man known as a \"San Francisco original\" and \"living landmark\" retires Sunday after 43 years in a changed city. San Francisco continues to grapple with homelessness, aggressive panhandling and vehicle break-ins even as some residents have become wealthier amid a tech boom. The hospitality industry has also changed dramatically, making Sweeney a throwback to an era when doormen hailed cabs and wrangled wheel-less suitcases. Today, most people hail rides via smartphone, and hardly anyone carries cash for tips. <mark>Joe</mark> D\u2019Alessandro, president and CEO of the San Francisco Travel Association, said Sweeney \"has been not just an ambassador but the embodiment of San Francisco's spirit--cheerful, helpful, upbeat, welcoming. He made visitors from around the world feel like instant friends .\" This week, Sweeney stood guard outside the Sir <mark>Francis Drake</mark>, near Union Square, in his elaborate British-style Beefeater jacket and knickers, red socks pulled to the knees and black hat decorated with red and white flowers. The 1928 hotel, named for the Elizabethan-era English explorer, has the costumes for its doormen custom-made. Sweeney's latest gold - and black-trimmed suit cost $3,000 and weighs about 40 pounds (18 kilograms). He tags luggage, waves to cable car passengers and grins for photos. Every now and then, Sweeney shoots his signature move: a finger snap accompanied by an \"Oh, yeah .\" \"I love your hat,\" says a boy checking into the hotel with his family. \"I love the flowers around it,\" says his sister, carrying a glittery pink backpack and a doll. Jennifer Emperador, a 39-year-old hotel concierge at Fisherman's Wharf, stopped by after her shift, determined to take a photo with Sweeney before he's gone. She lamented the loss of another fixture in a city where beloved businesses have shut down because of rising rents and changing consumer tastes. Luxury retailer Gump's, for example, closed its downtown doors in 2018, although new ownership may revive the store. \"It's almost like,\" What else is leaving in San Francisco?' \"she said .\" It's just not the same. \"Sweeney is not the hotel's only Beefeater doorman, although he is the best-known and the longest-lasting doorman in a city with about 100 of them. The San Francisco Chronicle toasted his 40th year on the job on its front page; he has his own plaque on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. The third-generation San Franciscan never dreamed he'd make such a mark impersonating a British guard when he took the job at 19 because his mother knew the hotel's general manager and they needed a doorman for the summer. He fell in love with the job, and San Francisco treated him like royalty. Then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein honored him with a special award in 1982 after he tackled--in full costume--two robbers fleeing with stolen suitcases. The other\" Nick of Time \"award winners that year were San Francisco 49ers quarterback <mark>Joe Montana</mark> and nimble-fingered receiver Dwight Clark for their role in\" The Catch, \"which led to the team's first Super Bowl win. Sweeney was frequently mentioned in the columns of Chronicle journalist and humorist Herb Caen, who memorialized San Francisco for decades. Getting a call from Caen, who died in 1997, was like getting a call from God, Sweeney said. At his San Francisco home, Sweeney stores news clippings, Beefeater memorabilia from fans, and previous costumes--he's had 46, one for every year plus some spares. The term\" Beefeater \"may refer to the guards who taste-tested food for French kings, or to the Beefeaters who still stand guard at the Tower of London, allegedly paid in beef chunks at one point. Sweeney is an avid marathoner who regularly runs San Francisco's annual\" Bay to Breakers \"race in costume. He has photos of himself with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, actress Sharon Stone and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Dolly Parton was\" really cool, \"he recalls, and Prince had purple suitcases. And it's not just the famous he remembers. Sweeney still cracks up over the guest from Texas who double-parked outside the hotel and waved at a cable car--which runs on fixed rails--\"to go around\" her. \"As a doorman, you're a greeter, a porter, a guide, a ringmaster, a constable, a valet and a concierge all in one gig,\" he said. \"I'll miss it, the people. You're dealing with positive people all day .\" He marvels at how San Francisco has grown, from 11,000 hotel rooms when he started to more than three times that today. He's not as enchanted, however, with the panhandlers who trail after tourists. \"The homeless problem is out of control, car break-ins, we never saw that growing up here,\" he said. \"It's just so sad to see this happening .\" Sweeney has been working since he was 14, selling soda alongside Tom Hanks at the Oakland Coliseum. He's up for spending more time with his wife, Cindy, a hospitality executive whom he chatted up at a cable car stop about a quarter-century ago, and their four grandchildren. Outside the hotel, cable car training instructor Tsombe Wolfe hopped off for his own photo with Sweeney. \"Tom's the guy. Man, he's the staple,\" he says. \"He's an ambassador to the city, just like the cable cars .\" Copyright \u00a9 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

so, read the old testament. or review the squabble between peter and paul over circumcision. the holy spirit has always found it necessary to work with the human materials at hand. and those materials have always been the same-not pretty. there was metaphorical (and sometimes real) blood on the floor of every one of the early church councils at which orthodox christian doctrine was defined and embodied in creeds. yes, it does take faith to believe that the decisions of these councils actually reflect belief as god would have it. it is the same act of faith that allows the christian to look around a church, see the assortment of annoying and downright unsavory characters occupying the pews, and affirm that the church is still, somehow, the\" body of christ. \"romancing the heretic the popular image presents the heretic as a courageous, powerless loner, exploring what fellow christians refuse to explore and paying the price at the hands of unprincipled church leaders motivated by entrenched prejudice. this holds no more water than the picture of the heretic as a black-hearted subversive and orthodox leaders as saints riding in on white horses. to take just one example, think of arius. this was the man whose teaching that jesus christ is less than fully divine (for a modern version, talk to a jehovah's witness) rocked the early church and led to the first ecumenical council. he and his followers were far from a weak, oppressed minority beset by power-hungry orthodox leaders. as tom oden puts it in his rebirth of orthodoxy, they\" lived by collusion with political oppressors. they had plenty of intellectuals and power manipulators on their side, while orthodoxy had to be defended largely by nonscholars and laypeople, by modest men and women of no means, by lowly persons who had no training or special expertise but understood their lives in christ. \"on the other hand, arius's opponent athanasius, the bold christian thinker whose leadership helped move the council of nicea to condemn arius, was no triumphant political manipulator. he was\" exiled a half-dozen times and chased all over the mediterranean world during the arian times. \"the example can be multiplied on both sides. to be sure, the inquisitorial practices of some past heresy hunts have left a permanent stain on the church-although the scale of what we might dub\" heresy abuse \"is often overblown. (contrary to popular fiction, being charged before one of the spanish inquisitions was not a guarantee of an auto-da-f\u00e9. statistical studies show that fewer than 2 percent of those charged were condemned to death .) still, we must not deny or defend travesties that did occur. at the same time, we must recognize the depth of the problem heresy trials have attempted to address. in most cases, not political but pastoral concerns have driven the church to prosecute teachers of aberrant doctrines. potent misdirection the problem is that the preached word has power-one way or the other. every sunday, unsuspecting people enter churches shepherded by those whose theological openness leads them to teach things we used to call heresies. what they hear in such teachings is not just divergent opinion. it is potent misdirection, capable of turning the sheep away from salvation. and this is the nub. as a teacher of mine once put it, if jack the ripper is abroad in your town, killing people and mutilating their bodies, the city's leaders must track him down and render him unable to inflict further harm. and if, as the historic church has always-until today-agreed, a person insists on teaching beliefs that threaten the eternal lives of all who hear them, that person must be disciplined and his harmful teaching rendered null within the church. it is easy for a comfortable\" christian \"society to demonize the mechanisms the historic church has developed to deal with heresy. but to wink at heresy is to suck the life from faith. heresies are worth fighting against, through the same kinds of mechanisms that the church has always used. yes, these mechanisms are tainted by politics and pride. but somehow still, we must believe, they have been used and will continue to be used by the holy spirit for the health of his church. in appleby's words,\" what we hold devoutly to be true, what we identify as the very core of our christian identity, has come to us through the imperfect channel of human history. \"<mark>chris armstrong</mark> is managing editor of christian history re-rooting spirituality in theology: a book worth reading: 31 minutes ago tangling with wolves: why we still need heresy trials: 1 day ago those odd, brilliant men and their scientific schemes: the religious back-story of the royal society: 3 days ago monks too heavenly minded to be any earthly good?
