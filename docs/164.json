the cnn wire staff updated 5:27 am edt, fri july 20, 2012 the defense department allows service members to wear uniforms at a gay pride parade more than 300 active-duty service members have signed up for the parade, an official says the administration repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" last year (cnn)--the u.s. department of defense is giving the go-ahead to all active-duty military personnel to wear their uniform to march in a gay pride parade in san diego on saturday, the first time such approval has been given in the united states. the defense department decision followed news that the navy had given approval to sailors to wear their uniform in the parade, which drew hundreds of active-duty service members last year shortly before the administration repealed \"don't ask, don't tell .\" \"based on our current knowledge of the event and existing policies, we hereby are granting approval for service members in uniform to participate in this year's parade,\" rene c. bardorf, deputy assistant secretary of defense for community and public outreach, said in a memorandum released thursday. the blanket approval for the various branches of the military applies only to the 2012 san diego pride parade, bardorf said. just a year ago, an active-duty service member faced punishment or discharge if he or she admitted being homosexual, but last september the administration scrapped the policy known as \"don't ask, don't tell .\" the defense department approval to allow service members to wear uniforms at the san diego parade follows reports that members of the military wore uniforms at a gay pride event held at the pentagon in june. under the guidelines released by the defense department, service members can wear their uniforms to march in the parade as long as they participate \"in a personal capacity\" and follow set standards of \"appearance and wear of the military uniform .\" while members of the military do not need approval to participate in civic events, they generally need approval to wear their uniforms. more than 300 active-duty service members have signed up to participate in the parade, dwayne crenshaw, executive director of san diego lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride, said thursday. last year, roughly 200 active-duty and retired military service members marched in the san diego parade, donning t-shirts to indicate their branch of military service. the 2011 parade took place one day after a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. the policy was formally revoked months later. cnn's

- mali's efforts to escape a post-coup crisis faced further upset wednesday after key political parties called for the prime minister to resign days before a deadline to form a new unity government. interim prime minister cheick modibo diarra has until july 31 to formulate a unity government which regional mediators demanded to deal with the deepening hold of hardline islamists on the north, which they occupied four months ago. but as diarra--an astrophysicist and american citizen--cobbles together this new regime, a grouping of key political parties and civil society organisations on tuesday demanded he step down. \"three months after its formation, the transition government led by cheick modibo diarra has only become bogged down in incompetence and amateurishness and mali is only sinking deeper,\" the united front for the defence of the republic and democracy (fdr) said in a statement. the fdr criticised his roadmap to escape the post-coup crisis as being vithout vision and \"clearly concocted under the pressure of events and in which the burning priorities of the nation are scarcely in evidence\". the grouping notably accused diarra of having \"no strategy to free, through war or negotiation\" the north of the country. one of the parties in the fdr is the malian democratic alliance, whose leader is president of the transition government dioncounda traore. <mark>traore</mark> has been in paris for two months after being violently mobbed in his office by opponents to his appointment. \"indeed, the ship is pitching,\" said an african diplomat based in bamako on condition of anonymity. \"we are a number of countries in the sub-region who have observed the current transition government is struggling to resolve urgent problems .\" armed islamist groups which security experts say are acting under the aegis of al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb, took advantage of a power vacuum after the march 22 coup to seize an area larger than france. since the formation of the 12-month transition government, the islamists have only deepened their hold, implementing strict sharia law and destroying ancient world heritage sites in the city of timbuktu. the occupation has also led to the displacement of some 400,000 malians, more than half of which are living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries, according to the un refugee agency. while diarra's interim government's main task was to solve the northern crisis, it has made no headway. the economic community of west african states (ecowas) ordered them to form a unity government uniting disparate political forces by july 31 or face suspension from the bloc. ecowas wants to send a 3,000-strong military force to mali, but is waiting for united nations approval and a formal request from bamako. \"it is up to the malians to decide who must be their prime minister and the make up of their government,\" a source within the mediation team in burkina faso told afp. he added that mediators want <mark>traore</mark> back in bamako by july 31. in paris ivory coast leader and current ecowas chief alassane ouattara is due to meet french president francois hollande on thursday as west africa's biggest crisis looms large. regional heads of state will meet in abidjan on wednesday to examine a report by military experts who carried out an \"audit\" of the foundering malian army to determine its needs. \"the situation in mali is getting worse every day,\" ivorian army chief soumaila bakayoko said at a ceremony opening the abidjan meeting. diarra, who worked for the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) and was also the microsoft chairman for africa, is the son in law of <mark>moussa traore</mark> who became president of mali after ousting a previous regime and ruled for 23 years until 1991. many in mali see him as too close to the former putschists led by amadou sanogo, who has remained influential despite handing power over to a civilian government and has been accused of meddling in political affairs. 25-07-2012 top rights lawyer praises senegal \"turnaround' in habre case 25-07-2012 rawlingses express condolences to mills' family 25-07-2012

\"quick and timely decisions\" on policy and other matters for effective management of drought. pawar, who joined office today after issues related to a week-long stand-off between the congress and his party ncp were sorted out, said the ministry is collecting details from states on the impact of poor rains. earlier in the day, pawar held discussions with food minister k v thomas and indian

says the goal of the restructuring is to flatten the company's management structure, which will allow it to sharpen its focus on its three major initiatives: yield management, improving efficiency in operations and meeting customers' needs. the principal organizational changes that will take place are: removal of the management layer consisting of four geographic groups (eastern, midwest, southern and western); consolidation and reduction of the number of areas managing the core collection, disposal and recycling businesses from 22 to 17; reduction of corporate support staff to better align their support with the needs of the operating units while reducing costs; and additionally, wm has announced the following appointments: james trevathan jr., previously executive vice president - growth, innovation and field support, has been appointed executive vice president and coo. <mark>jeff harris</mark> and <mark>john morris</mark> have each been appointed senior vice president, field operations. <mark>harris</mark> was most recently senior vice president - midwest group, and <mark>morris</mark> was most recently chief strategy officer. in their new roles, they will oversee the 17 operating areas. <mark>david steiner</mark>, president and ceo of waste management, says, \"the steps we are taking to restructure our organization are expected to provide two very important results for us. first, the restructuring is expected to reduce our cost structure by about 100 basis points in 2013. this is a good step toward our longer-term goal to reduce costs by 200 to 400 basis points. second, we believe that eliminating a layer of management and restructuring our support staff around our three major initiatives will intensify our focus on achieving those initiatives .\" <mark>steiner</mark> continues, \"jim trevathan has been in a role where he had all of the operations staff that supports the field reporting to him. in order to improve the connection between that staff and field operations, it makes sense to have the persons responsible for field operations also reporting to jim. in addition, we have two excellent executives to fill those field operations roles in <mark>jeff harris</mark> and <mark>john morris</mark>. the 17 area vice presidents will report directly to one of these two senior vice presidents .\" recyclingtoday: agilyx ceo named
