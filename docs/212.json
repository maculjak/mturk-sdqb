(LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group) By Howard Mintz, Bay Area News Group, @ hmintz on Twitter Posted: #Comments Leland Yee, the former state senator, leaves the federal courthouse in San Francisco in July after accepting a plea bargain in the corruption and gun trafficking investigation. (Laura A. Oda/Bay Area News Group) SAN FRANCISCO>> From the day last year that FBI agents swooped down on former state Sen. Leland Yee and dozens of other targets of the sprawling crime and corruption probe dubbed \"Operation Whitesuit,\" one central figure made it clear he would not go down easily. Raymond \"Shrimp Boy\" Chow. While Yee and every other defendant hunkered down and worked behind the scenes to cope with the U.S. Justice Department's sweeping racketeering indictment, Chow, the reputed head of San Francisco's Chinese crime syndicate, went public with his indignant claims of innocence. J. Tony Serra, a San Francisco defense lawyer famed for taking on the government, even held a news conference in his offices the week of the March 2014 arrests, handing out \"Free Shrimp Boy\" T-shirts to make his jailed client's case. This week, the collision course between Chow and federal prosecutors will finally reach its climax in federal court in San Francisco. Both sides will pick a jury for a trial that will decide racketeering charges against Chow ranging from gun trafficking to murder--and also serve as a referendum on the government's five-year undercover sting operation, which relied on wiretaps, informants, bags of cash and booze-filled meetings in fancy hotels and restaurants to snag the FBI's quarry, including Yee. \"It's all a gamble,\" said San Rafael resident Rory Little, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, in San Francisco. \"Until the play opens, you don't know how it will end. But when (Serra) makes these arguments, juries like him. If they like him, they hear him on how it's on the big, bad government.\" When the trial begins in earnest Nov. 9, jurors will certainly hear two competing stories. Federal prosecutors will depict Chow as a violent gang leader with a long history of overseeing Chinatown's crime scene. Chow's lawyers will try to sell him as a reformed criminal who turned straight only to be framed by federal agents trying to justify one of the longest and most expensive undercover probes in recent Bay Area history. And given that Yee and other key defendants in the case already have pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and await sentencing, it may be the public's only full glimpse of the government's operation. The \"Dragonhead' Federal prosecutors do have plenty of ammunition. In a sweeping federal indictment alleging dozens of crimes, prosecutors portray Chow as the leader, or\" Dragonhead, \"of an Asian organization called the Ghee Kung Tong that law enforcement agents say was involved in drug and gun trafficking and money laundering, as well as trafficking in stolen booze and cigarettes. Advertisement Charges added to the case in October also now link Chow to the murders of at least two alleged gang rivals, one gunned down in San Francisco in 2006 and the other found dead with his wife in Mendocino County two years ago. During the course of the undercover probe, Chow allegedly accepted thousands of dollars in cash for a variety of crimes from FBI agents posing as businessmen and gangsters, according to court papers. The 55-year-old Chow also has previously served federal prison time for racketeering and other crimes. He was sentenced to 24 years in federal prison in 2000, but served only three years after cooperating in the government's case against another reputed Asian organized crime figure.\" Dave' the FBI agent But defense lawyers plan to put the government itself on trial, particularly the lead undercover FBI agent, who met repeatedly with Chow, plying him with drinks and handing him envelopes of cash in posh spots such as the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco. The agent is only identified as \"Dave,\" denigrated in Chow's court papers as \"suffering from logorrhea and a generous dollop of Tourette's disorder as well.\" Defense lawyers say the recently added murder charges are a late, desperate move to bolster the government's case, relying on what they describe as dishonest informers who've cut deals with prosecutors. \"It is so far astray from legitimate law enforcement it doesn't make any sense,\" said Curtis Briggs, who is aiding Serra in the defense. \"It's a cops-and-robbers game gone wrong.\" The trial is unlikely to delve much into the political corruption allegations against Yee, who was charged with accepting bribes in exchange for political favors. But it is expected to touch on the origins of the investigation, which only stumbled upon Yee as the FBI probe into Chow's dealings connected the ex-legislator with a number of figures, including San Francisco political consultant <mark>Keith Jackson</mark>, who also has pleaded guilty to racketeering. The direct ties between Yee and Chow in the indictment are tenuous, other than an allegation the legislator agreed to back a resolution praising the Ghee Kung Tong organization for campaign cash, but <mark>Jackson</mark>'s involvement with Chow led the FBI to the senator--and the pursuit of the bribery aspect of the probe. \"A workable strategy' James Brosnahan, <mark>Jackson</mark>'s lawyer, said the Chow trial can shine a light on what he considers a wayward investigation that should be reviewed by the Justice Department. And Brosnahan believes a Bay Area jury may be receptive to Serra's fiery style of characterizing the government as worse than the crimes it is pursuing.\" It is a workable strategy, \"said Brosnahan, also a high-profile Bay Area defense lawyer.\" I've not seen a case where the government had a sting operation that lasted this long, cost this much money and went at people who otherwise would not be involved in this kind of thing. \"Little, however, cautions that Chow must do more than simply attack the government for the FBI's tactics.\" It's not a powerful argument to just say the government spent a lot of money, that they spent (many) years on this, \"he said.\" (Racketeering laws) were invented to prosecute Mafia bosses. The allegations here boil down to Shrimp Boy Chow being a Chinese gang Mafia boss. There is no question Shrimp Boy was the main target. \""}, {"articleID": "2017041714_00747013_W", "names": {"John Fraser": ["Q16090802", "Q16729089", "Q1700123", "Q17523755", "Q17523831", "Q19565408", "Q3181531", "Q43910851", "Q52732316", "Q6217676", "Q6234025", "Q6234043", "Q6234047", "Q6234049", "Q6234053", "Q6234056"]}, "date": "2017-04-17", "url": "http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/4602458/land-deal-set-for-corowa-splash-park/?cs=4067", "content": "Federation Council administrator expected to ratify in-principle support for Corowa water fun park READY TO ROLL: Shaun Whitechurch with consortium members Stephen O'Bryan and <mark>John Fraser</mark> with plans for their water fun park to be built near Corowa's tennis centre. A PLAN for a privately-run water fun park at Corowa is set to get a major boost at Federation Council's meeting on Tuesday. Shire administrator Mike Eden should give in-principle support for the development to be located on council land in Riesling Street near the town's tennis club. The approval will be subject to a satisfactory management plan and lease deal between the shire and consortium of fun park investors. In her report recommending the move, Federation Council corporate and community services director Kristy Kay noted positive opinion for the plan. \"The proposal has generated much interest from the local community with 21 responses received,\" Ms Kay stated. \"Overall most people (19) were in support of the proposed development.\" Whilst only two responses were against the proposed development, they identified the location as being the main issue, citing reasons such as safety, cost for families, commercial viability and sustainability. \"Consortium spokesman Shaun Whitechurch welcomed the council's backing.\" From our point of view it's great that they are going to the recommendation and should it go through as presented the consortium can now put their whole development and plans to the council, so we can get the ball rolling, \"Mr Whitechurch said. He expected the group would be able to present a detailed blueprint to the council for consideration at its May meeting. The first stage of the fun park would involve three water slides, a mini splash pad, kiosk and barbecue area. A second leg is to include a putt putt golf course and an area for an animal farm to occupy in school holidays. Mr Whitechurch has not put a value on the aquatic project but it could be similar to the $350,000 spent on the Wangaratta splash park which replaced the Yarrunga pool. A valuation of the land to determine a rental figure will be required as part of the process.\" The consortium don't expect the lease for nix, they expect rent to be on commercial terms, \"Mr Whitechurch said. He admitted the group's original aim of opening by December 1 would be tight.\" Whilst having it ready for next summer is optimistic nothing is impossible if approvals fall into place relatively quickly, \"Mr Whitechurch said."}, {"articleID": "2019052115_00341318_W", "names": {"Paul Davies": ["Q16669255", "Q21131684", "Q535733", "Q7150145", "Q7150146", "Q7150147", "Q7150148", "Q7150149", "Q7150150", "Q976254"], "Mike Holmes": ["Q14950204", "Q20676979", "Q6847289", "Q6847291", "Q6847293"], "Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"]}, "date": "2019-05-21", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/games/17281/Destiny/?sid=56e4cbef0f2287f1edff55384775f80e", "content": "DESTINY REVIEW.

We stuck together as a team.\" Earlier in the day in this building, No. 12 seed Harvard knocked off No. 5 Cincinnati in an East Region game that had the local Spokane crowd generally rooting for the Crimson.

On his return to the continent this week with a trip to Catholic majority Chile and Peru, Francis will not only speak his native Spanish but also a vibrant spiritual and cultural language common to all. \"I feel free, nothing scares me,\" the pontiff once said, despite shouldering the burden of leading the world's 1.3 billion Catholics, nearly half of whom live in the Americas. It was a typically American expression according to fellow Argentine, Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who has known Francis for decades. \"North and South America are both societies with European origins that have realised they need independence. The idea of freedom is the cornerstone of the Americas,\" the philosophy professor told AFP. The first pope to address the United States congress has \"a strong sense of human dignity and freedom\" , he says. But while one of the Americas has prospered, the other has become increasingly impoverished. \"The pope is very sensitive to the issue of social justice--a more Latin than North American theme, hence the interest he has for the\" peripheries' in difficulty, \"Sorondo said, referring to Francis's support for those on the margins .--\"Link between worlds'--The Archbishop of Buenos Aires was virtually an unknown when he was elected on March 13, 2013, becoming the first pope to choose the name Francis--a homage to St. Francis of Assisi, who dedicated his life to the poor. The Argentine hails from a family of Italian immigrants and became\" a sort of link between the Old World and the New World \", says Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of the Vatican's L\u2019Osservatore Romano newspaper. However,\" the dramatic history of Argentina at the end of the 20th century is what shapes his personal trajectory \", he says in the preface to a book called\" Francis, the American pope \". In 2007, Jorge Bergoglio was elected by his fellow bishops in Aparecida in Brazil to draw up the final document of the Latin American Episcopal Council, which can be read as a guide to many of the themes dearest to him. Bergoglio stressed the ills of a\" scandalous inequality which wounds personal dignity \", a theme which\" clearly guides his actions at the head of the church today \", Vatican specialist Nicolas Seneze writes in\" The Words of the Pope \". The Aparecida conference\" prioritised the poor \", Sarondo said.\" The pope is very critical of capitalism which sacrifices human rights--a typical stance of the Latin American episcopate, \"he added .--\"Faith and blood'--While Polish pope <mark>John Paul</mark> II had denounced\" wild capitalism \", Francis has taken more concrete steps, such as calling for\" a poor church for the poor \"and turning down a luxurious papal apartment for a humble hotel room, he said. Bergoglio was an active pastor, taking the bus around Buenos Aires and heading without a second thought into slums in Latin America to comfort the poor. An inmate at the Virgen de Fatima Women's prison in Lima shows handmade wooden rosaries made by the prisoners. A total of 72 inmates in the prison have produced 33,000 rosaries to be sold at stores in Lima, to donate the proceedings to Pope Francis His experience of the Argentine economic crisis has also shaped his idea of\" the misery of big cities \", which fatally attract poor farmers from the countryside in search of a better life, stripping them of their culture. His vision was strongly influenced by the\" theology of the people \", the Argentine, non-violent version of the South American Liberation theology--a strain without the focus on the Marxist class struggle. And since his arrival in Rome, the pope has created new Latin American cardinals, saying\" they bring with them the air of new churches and of a history of faith and of blood \". In doing so, he is also reshaping in his image the conclave of cardinals that will elect his successor."}, {"articleID": "2016022119_00774204_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2016-02-21", "url": "http://dhakatribune.com/world/2016/feb/22/gop-candidates-offer-stark-contrast-visions-field-thins", "content": "today's paper>> world>> published: 00:41 february 22, 2016 GOP candidates offer stark contrast in visions as field thins Reuters As the presidential field winnows after <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s commanding victory in South Carolina's nominating contest, US Republican voters face a choice that grows starker by the day. Do they back the rage-infused, turn-back-the-clock tone of <mark>Trump</mark>, or perhaps his conservative, evangelical rival, Ted Cruz? Or do they favour the sunnier, more inclusive appeals of emerging establishment favourite Marco Rubio or Ohio Governor John Kasich. Not only will the answer decide the Republican nominee, it may well change what it means to be a Republican. The party is enduring a schism between those who want to work within the system and those want to tear it down. \"The GOP is broken may not be salvageable,\" said Juleanna Glover, a Republican consultant in Washington who had supported Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race on Saturday after a poor showing in South Carolina. <mark>Trump</mark>'s support, she said, shows that one-third of the party's voters \"want out.\" Bush, the former Florida governor, had been part of that camp of Republican establishment optimists. Ben Carson, the right-wing retired neurosurgeon, was never a factor in South Carolina and could be the next to exit. That leaves a Final Four, of sorts, as the campaign maintains a southern focus for a string of contests on March 1 that include Georgia, Texas, and Virginia. <mark>Trump</mark> and Cruz will be the favourites in many of them, with Rubio, a senator from Florida, and Kasich seen struggling until the primary schedule shifts to more hospitable regions, including their home states. Rubio finished in a near tie for second in South Carolina with Cruz, rebounding strongly from his stumble in New Hampshire, where he finished fifth and was criticised for being overly scripted. He stands to benefit the most from Bush's departure as the perceived establishment standard-bearer. Kasich trailed well behind, managing fewer votes than Bush. Going to extremes Billionaire real estate developer <mark>Trump</mark> has racked up wins in two of the three early-voting states by channeling the disillusionment many Americans, especially the white working-class, feel with stagnant wages, globalisation, the influence of corporate money in politics, and a gridlocked government. Cruz, a senator from Texas, has courted libertarian and religious voters who believe their values are under assault. Both strike a tone of alarm, largely about the porous US southwest border and the threat of Dae's h. And both often offer a paean to the past, asking voters to envision a time when the country appeared to be more prosperous and homogenous. Some Republicans fear that the appeal of either candidate will simply be too narrow. Alternatively, Rubio and Kasich bill themselves as healers of America's fractured politics. On the stump, Rubio speaks of uniting the quarrelsome factions of the Republican Party, and has embraced diversity in a way that his competitors have not. Rubio has vowed to grow and unite the party and broaden its appeal among younger Americans. The contrast between Rubio's events Friday and those of <mark>Trump</mark> and Cruz was vivid. <mark>Trump</mark>, just a day after getting into public spat with Pope Francis, told an apocryphal story about a general who executed Muslims using bullets dipped in pig blood.

By Series: PGA Tour Published: Sunday, May 07, 2017 | 11:38 a.m. WILMINGTON, N. C .--It took about 45 holes, but <mark>Dustin Johnson</mark> finally looked like the world's top-ranked golfer again on his final nine holes Saturday afternoon at Eagle Point Golf Club. The Coastal Carolina alumnus and shot a bogey-free 5-under 67 in the third round of the 15th Wells Fargo Championship to climb into a tie for 14th at 4-under 212 and pull within four shots of leader <mark>Patrick Reed</mark>. Four of <mark>Johnson</mark>'s five birdies came on his second nine. RELATED: Wells Fargo Championship leaderboard | Photos With his late rally, <mark>Johnson</mark> still has hope of becoming the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007-08 to win four consecutive starts on the PGA Tour. \"If it's windy again tomorrow, hopefully I get off to a good start and post a real good number and let them play for it,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said. \"Starting today I thought it was going to take 11 or 12 under, and I'm 4 under so I need to shoot 7 under tomorrow probably to have a chance.\" <mark>Johnson</mark> made a 22-foot birdie putt on his first hole of the third round, the par-3 10th, then made four birdies on his second nine with putts of 4, 3, 3 and 9 feet, the final birdie coming on the tough par-4 ninth hole. He's having difficulty reading Eagle Point's greens in his first look at the course. \"I just need to putt better,\" <mark>Johnson</mark> said. \"Even this afternoon I didn't putt good. I shot 5 under and hit it good and chipped it well but didn't make any putts hardly. I made a nice one to start the day and nice one to finish, but I've missed a lot of 10-footers for birdie out there.\" ...The greens are kind of tricky, they're real subtle. I just haven't played and my feel is a little bit off. I just need some more rounds. I feel like it's getting better. It's getting there. \"No. 1 in the World. No. 1 in the FedExCup standings.

He put a new TaylorMade driver into play in the third round, replacing a driver that won three consecutive tournaments.\" was in play, that's all I care about, \"<mark>Johnson</mark> said.\" I hit one good drive all day...The problem is I'm not swinging good enough to judge. I've got to start hitting it solid first then I'll be able to figure out which one I want to use. \"<mark>Johnson</mark>'s second round was suspended due to darkness Friday, and he made two bogeys and a birdie on the five holes he played to complete his second round Saturday morning to make the cut on the number at 1-over 145. In the second round, <mark>Johnson</mark> birdied the 15th hole, bogeyed holes 16 and 17 and made a par on the 18th to be among the 79 players who made the cut to Saturday's third round.\" I wasn't worried about the cut, \"<mark>Johnson</mark> said. His second-round 3-over-par 75 is <mark>Johnson</mark>'s highest round since last September's Deutsche Bank Championship. <mark>Johnson</mark> practiced in the two hours he had between the second and third rounds, paying particular attention to the short game and putting.\" I'm just rusty. I really hadn't had any practice coming into here. I mean none, \"<mark>Johnson</mark> said.\" ...That's the biggest thing. I had a little bit better feel out there today. It's just going to take a little bit of time to get back into it. But I felt like I played pretty well this afternoon. \"<mark>Johnson</mark> is playing his first tournament since winning the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Championship on March 26 and spent the past four weeks recovering from a back injury incurred when he slipped and landed on a small staircase on the eve of the Masters Tournament. <mark>Johnson</mark> tees off with Morgan Hoffmann at 12:25 in the final round, 1:20 before the final group of <mark>Reed</mark> and Alex Noren. Lefty makes charge Phil Mickelson played Saturday like the tournament hasn't changed venues this year. Though he has yet to win at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, Mickelson has nine top-10s and seven top-fives including a runner-up finish in 2010 in the Wells Fargo, and he made a move Saturday at Eagle Point.

He made four birdies--holing a pair of 15-foot birdie putts and a 7-footer, and chipping in from 35 feet on the fifth hole--while making a bogey on the ninth hole.\" I had a lot of opportunities to take it even lower and really move up the leaderboard, but it was a good solid day, \"Mickelson said.\" At least I put myself in position where if I get hot tomorrow and get it going I can make up the ground. I was thinking I needed to shoot 5, 6, 7 under today to get right where I wanted. \"Mickelson believes a low number is possible at Eagle Point, but it won't be easy.\" Surprisingly, you can be a little more aggressive than you think, but you have to use the slopes and contours on the green to stop the ball close rather than just flying it right at it because still, even though they're softer than the first couple of days, they're still tough to hold anything past a wedge, \"Mickelson said.\" But I think it's a lot easier today than it has been the first two days. \"A cut above WATCH: Nicklaus nearly holds out | Fowler, Thomas, Walker at the Derby Because more than 78 players made the 36-hole cut, another cut to the low 70 scores and ties was made after 54 holes Saturday afternoon.
