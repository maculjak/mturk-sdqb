Peyper sent Vahaamahina off for his brazen act of thuggery early in the second-half of Sunday's 20-19 World Cup quarter-final defeat by Wales. In full view of Oita Stadium, the Clermont lock struck Aaron Wainwright on the jaw while France staged an attacking maul, leaving Peyper to make one of the easier decisions of his career. But the South Africa official has now invited controversy on to himself after a picture emerged on social media showing him posing with Welsh fans and playfully landing an elbow on to the head of one. France's Sebastien Vahaamahina sits out after receiving a red card (David Davies/PA)\" This photo if it is true is shocking and explanations will be necessary, \"French Rugby Federation vice president Dr <mark>Serge Simon</mark> said on Twitter. Wales head coach Warren Gatland and his France counterpart <mark>Jacques Brunel</mark> endorsed Peyper's decision to issue the eighth red card of Japan 2019. The 28-year-old forward, scorer of his side's opening try, spent the rest of the game sat on the bench with his hands on his head .\" The officials dealt with it appropriately. I don't think anyone could complain about that. The right decision was made, \"Gatland said .\" Rugby is heat of the moment stuff and he made an error of judgement. When you have got a lot of testosterone involved in some pretty high intensity games, that will sometimes happen. He's made a poor decision. \"<mark>Brunel</mark> agreed that Vahaamahina deserved to be dismissed .\" The red card I don't contest--when you see the images it's very clear. He did have contact with the face so we can't deny that, \"<mark>Brunel</mark> said .\" Of course it changed the game. When you're playing half the match with 14 men it's difficult. \"0 comment", "articleID": "2019102105_00020024_W", "names": {"Jacques Brunel": ["Q2480198", "Q50700550"], "Serge Simon": ["Q3479538", "Q52906755"]}}, {"date": "2019-10-21", "url": "http://gulfnews.com/uae/uae-based-couple-create-top-ranking-school-in-kerala-india-1.67171990", "content": "A UAE-based Indian couple's efforts and perseverance at elevating the conditions of girl's government school in Kozhikode cty, Kerala, India has paid rich dividends catapulting it to the top 2 government schools in the country by the Education World (EW) India School Rankings in 2019-2020. Image Credit: Supplied Dubai A UAE-based Indian couple's efforts to elevate the standard of a girl's government school in Kozhikode of India's Kerala has paid rich dividends, with the local government now set to implement its exemplary model across 1,000 government schools in the state. The Nadakkavu Government Vocational Higher Secondary School (GVHSS) for Girls, now a flagbearer of excellence in education in India with a focus on the holistic development of students, has also been ranked as the No. 2 government school in the country in the Education World (EW) India School Rankings in 2019-2020. EW, India, is the world's largest survey of primary-secondary schools with scores based on interviews with parents, senior school students, principals and teachers. The schools are evaluated on 14 different categories. A once-crumbling school, the 120-year-old GVHSS underwent an infrastructural transformation in 2015 with funds from UAE based Faizal and Shabana Foundation, the philanthropy arm of KEF holdings, a Dubai-based company. The school is run by Faizal and Shabana Kottikolon, co-founders of the foundation. Faizal, founder and chairman of KEF Holdings, said: \"The top ranking for Nadakkavu school is a true testament to the success of our foundation's vision,\" Giving to Create Impact'. Our goal is to drive the positive transformation of government--and private--schools through an integrated and participatory approach. We are honoured to have created this benchmark of excellence for education in India. We will continue to drive our education engagement initiatives across the country as well as in other nations. \"How it all began As Faizal said,\" It all started with an interview where someone asked me what I thought India needed to do to change the face of public education. I realised dilapidated infrastructure was the first thing that needed change. Poor conditions not only lowered self-esteem of children but was the main cause of absenteeism and high dropout rate. So in collaboration with <mark>Pradeep Kumar</mark>, a local legislator, we began our work. When we arrived at this school the first time in 2014, we saw the structure was dilapidated. The building housed classes for 2,400 girls, but had only eight toilets. The mid-day meals were not providing enough nutrition and teachers were qualified but had no upgrading of skills programme. \"<mark>Pradeep Kumar</mark>, who had founded Prism (Promoting Regionals Schools to International Standards through Multiple Interventions) was planning to utilise a portion of the development funds granted to local legislators--in this case around Rs10 million (around Dh561,445)--to repair the crumbling school. The Kottikolon's invited the Indian Institute of Managemnt (IIM) Calicut to conduct research into why students were not inspired to study despite free education and free meals along with well qualified teachers. Armed with research and feedback on what was required and with consultation from iternational architects from Denmark and UK, the school underwent the transformation. Faizal said:\" We did not want to disrupt the school for a single day and undertook the project during the summer vacations, completing it in 95 days, Old walls were pulled down, new ones designed, toilets built and teachers imparted training through IIM Calicut. Suddenly the self-confidence of students and teachers went up manifold when the school reopened for the new academic year in 2015. New look New structures at the school included a 132,000-sq ft landscaped garden, a library with around 25,000 books and an 18,110-sq-ft astro-turf multipurpose playing field for athletics, football and hockey. A new sports complex with a 13,000-sq-ft indoor stadium, wood-floored basketball and badminton courts, and spacious changing and locker rooms for students were also built. Learning became fun and interactive as the classrooms were digitally equipped. Students took pride in carrying out experiments in modern laboratories for physics, chemistry and botany. Sanity and hygiene went up several notches with the construction of 92 spotless toilets, a corporate-style kitchen and dining hall that could seat about 600 students at a time. In an economically empowering experiment, village women found employment cooking at the school kitchen providing healthy, wholesome meals to the students and earning a modest income. All this brought about a dramatic turnaround of the average performance of the students as results indicated. In the 2015 board examinations, every student who took the exam passed, with 21 out of 393 students securing A + (above 92 per cent) in all subjects--a 400 per cent increase in A + grades since 2012. Self-sustainable The school has become the pride of Calicut and a central hub for the community, said Faizal. The facilities are utilised for a fee by the community. The entire neighbourhood uses the school grounds for morning walks and yoga camps during the weekends. The modern stadium and playgrounds are also leased out for community functions. Shabana, co-founder of the foundation, and vice chairperson of KEF Holdings, said: \"Since the inception of the foundation over 10 years ago, our single-minded focus was on driving social impact through our programmes. We are privileged to undertake the opportunity to support this school with a history of over 120 years, and to transform it into one of India's leading schools. More importantly, we see incremental value from this transformation. All our students benefit from high-quality education, delivered by a team of committed teachers. We see these students evolving as well-rounded individuals who can contribute incredible value to the society .\" What the students say Ayina P. P: Class 12, studying in Nadakkavu school since 5th std (2013) \"I am from a middle class family. I came here in 5th std and that time there was a small canteen and buildings were not clean. Then suddenly things changed, though I didn't understand that time what happened, today I know the effort it took .\" One important feeling I have is in this school we are asked to decide for ourselves and this has made me responsible and confident about taking decisions, making mistakes and still believing in myself. I am happy to be part of this school and this has changed my outlook in life. \"Neehara E: Class 12, studying in Nadakkavu school since 5th std (2013)\" The school gives us opportunities to grow and develop ideas on our own. Shiju sir my present teacher pushes me to present speeches, thoughts for the day which helps me develop my skills. I feel more confident and my efficiency has grown over the years, My dream is to become an entrepreneur and I would like to study at IIMK. My personal life too has become positive because of this school. \"Suhina Cherott: studied at Nadakkavu from 2010 - 2012 and is now a health care technician planning to do her PhD\" Earlier, when I was studying, the school was in a bad condition. When I passed out, the sudden change happened. I wish I had been there during this change. \"A UAE-based Indian couple's efforts and perseverance at elevating the conditions of girl's government school in Kozhikode cty, Kerala, India has paid rich dividends catapulting it to the top 2 government schools in the country by the Education World (EW) India School Rankings in 2019-2020.

Whyte was down in the ninth round. There was controversy in the aftermath of that bout, when it was revealed that Whyte had tested positive for two metabolites of a banned substance in an anti-doping test administered by UKAD in June. <mark>Rivas</mark> and his handlers were unaware of the positive test, and they had no knowledge that a confidential hearing took place on the morning of fight - where a panel allowed Whyte to move forward with the contest. Whyte is still involved in a confidential legal process with UKAD. The WBC have suspended his mandatory status - until the situation with UKAD is resolved. If Whyte is suspended by UKAD, <mark>Rivas</mark> and his handlers would likely petition the WBC for a mandatory title shot. Top Rank Vice President Carl Moretti confirmed that a multi-fight deal has been presented to <mark>Rivas</mark> and his promoter, <mark>Yvon Michel</mark>. That multi-fight deal includes a future fight with undefeated Tyson Fury. But Moretti is not alone in his chase. Eddie Hearn, who promoted <mark>Rivas</mark>' fight with Whyte, is also offering the Canadian heavyweight a multi-fight deal. Top Rank is aligned with ESPN, while Hearn has an exclusive deal with streaming service DAZN. \"I'm aware of Hearn's offer to <mark>Rivas</mark>. It's part of the boxing business. It's up to <mark>Oscar</mark> and his team to make their decision. If he decides not to take our offer [and go with Hearn], it will be more difficult to offer him a fight against Fury,\" Moretti confirmed to The Montreal Journal. This week, <mark>Michel</mark> will travel to Canc\u00fan for the WBC convention with the boxer and the manager of <mark>Rivas</mark>, St\u00e9phane L\u00e9pine. At the end of the week, they will make a decision on the direction of the heavyweight's career.

They play hockey against one another, and finish each other's sentences. So they were perhaps the perfect duo to spring into action on Saturday afternoon when, pedalling to Juliet's Barrhaven home from a playdate in nearby Furness Park, the two discovered a man in his 60s sprawled on the ground, on his back, in cardiac arrest. The man may owe his life to the two girls. \"He was like this,\" said Darcy, re-enacting the scene, her legs on the sidewalk, her torso on Lydia Way, on the north side of the park. \"And his phone was here,\" added Juliet a Grade 6 student at Jean-Robert Gauthier Catholic school, pointing to a spot on the road near Darcy's outstretched right arm. \"It looked like he was calling someone .\" The man's chest, they noted, was not moving. \"He wasn't breathing,\" recalled Darcy, in Grade 6 at St. John XXIII Catholic school. They recounted, too, how a number of cars approached, slowed, and continued on without stopping. They were frightened, but knew what to do. Darcy, who lives in the Craig Henry neighbourhood and whose father is an Ottawa firefighter, stayed with the man while Juliet went to a friend's house for help. No one was home. Juliet called out to Darcy to go to another house, while she returned to the man's side. Darcy rang a door bell, to no avail. The girls then noticed two men working on a car and approached them for help. One of the men called 911. The other ran over to the fallen man, and told the girls to go get their parents. They then went to the corner of Amarillo and Crestway drives, to direct police, paramedic and fire responders to the scene. Juliet Murphy (right) and Darcy Power pose for a photo at Furness Park in Ottawa Tuesday Oct 22, 2019. Juliet and Darcy found a 60-year-old man who'd suffered a cardiac arrest at Amarillo Drive and Lydia Way, in Barrhaven Saturday and got help. <mark>Tony Caldwell</mark> / Postmedia From their vantage point a block away, the girls couldn't see paramedics use a defibrillator on the man, and didn't learn for a couple of days that he arrived at the hospital unconscious and in critical condition, but alive. It wasn't until Ottawa Paramedic Service put out a news release on Monday, looking to identify the Good Samaritans, that they learned of the man's immediate fate. Juliet cried--tears of joy and relief. Darcy sprang from the dinner table and performed three jumping jacks and one squat. \"It feels really good to help somebody, but if you don't know if they're OK, you start to get scared,\" said Juliet. \"Did I really help this person or did I make it worse?\" \"Did I take too long?\" added Darcy. \"Did I do something wrong?\" But back at the park on Tuesday, the pair were greeted by at least one neighbour who came out to thank them. \"Thanks for what you did,\" he said. People are calling them heroes. \"That means you're helping people in need,\" explained Darcy. \"You're not just helping people to get a reward or something .\" \"Because no matter the cost,\" interjected Juliet, \"you need to help somebody. Because if you don't, it kind of stings .\" \"Nice,\" she added \"always beats self-centered .\" \"We made a good choice,\" said Darcy. \"We were so happy...\"(Juliet)\" ...that we saved a life. (Darcy) \"He could have been gone, just like that .\" I was just scared at the beginning...but getting scared won't help the guy. Things won't go out of control if you just stay calm. \"\"What these two ladies did was really amazing,\" said Marc-Antoine Deschamps of the Ottawa Paramedic Service. \"They took charge. They didn't just walk by and ignore a man in distress .\" The pair credited their parents for teaching them what to do in such emergencies. \"You always learn by your parents because they always talk about it,\" said Juliet. \"Sometimes you don't listen, but the good things always stick in your head .\" ", "articleID": "2019102222_00113778_W", "names": {"Tony Caldwell": ["Q4873687", "Q7822011"]}}, {"date": "2019-10-23", "url": "http://www.bostonherald.com/2019/10/23/patriots-qb-tom-brady-on-retirement-speculation-i-dont-know-what-the-future-holds/", "content": "FOXBORO, MA .--OCTOBER 8: <mark>Tom Brady</mark> #12 of the New England Patriots speaks to reporters at Gillette Stadium on October 8, 2019 in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

He didn't exactly shoot down any of the talk. He said he was uncertain about his future. \"That is the great part for me, I don't know,\" <mark>Brady</mark> said. \"I think that has been a unique situation that I have been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years you kind feel like (there is) the responsibility to always fulfill the contract.
