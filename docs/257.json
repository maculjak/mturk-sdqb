The event will run from 12:00 PM--2:00 PM in Room 129 in the Capitol Annex. The informal setup will allow industry stake-holders, including horse enthusiasts and racing fans, to interact with a variety of state senators and representatives. Horses of all breeds form a $4 billion industry in the Commonwealth, supporting an estimated 100,000 in direct and indirect jobs and spanning all 120 counties. Kentucky is home to 35,000 operations with at least one horse, totaling 242,400 equines and $23.4 billion when including related assets, according to a University of Kentucky Department of Agriculture survey. \"KEEP Day is a convenient way for people working in businesses connected to equines, as well as those who show, ride and own horses, to meet with our lawmakers and let them know that every county and district benefits from horses,\" said KEEP executive vice president <mark>Elisabeth Jensen</mark>. \"We encourage those involved with every breed and discipline to come and show support for our signature industry that creates so many jobs.\" Created in 2004 to preserve, promote and protect the state's signature industry, KEEP represents and advocates on behalf of Kentucky's entire horse industry--all breeds and equine pursuits. \"People might be surprised to know how many trail-riding and pleasure horses there are in Kentucky--about 80,000,\" <mark>Jensen</mark> said. \"While there are about 54,000 Thoroughbreds in the Commonwealth, there also are 45,000 Quarter Horses and 36,000 Tennessee Walking Horses. All these horses eat grain and hay provided by our farmers, and their owners buy trucks, trailers, tractors and tack, also paying for an array of services such as boarding, instruction and training, farriers and veterinarians. We want those voices heard at KEEP Day and encourage participants to let their state legislators know that they are attending.\" Rep. James Kay of Versailles said at last year's inaugural KEEP Day that horses are an important economic tool even in areas of Kentucky that aren't home to high-profile breeding farms or racetracks. \"We absolutely benefit from the horse industry every day in ways that people don't always understand,\" Kay said. \"We need to do a better job articulating that, and showing the economic driver that the industry is for our people.\" New to the Paulick Report?

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaking during the 9th ASEAN <mark>UN</mark> Summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2017. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued a grim warning as 2017 drew to a close. In a somber video address posted to Twitter on New Year's Eve, he cautioned that the globe was on \"red alert\" following a year marked by deepening conflicts and \"new dangers.\" \"When I took office a year ago, I appealed for 2017 to be a year for peace,\" Guterres said in the clip. \"Unfortunately, in fundamental ways, the world has gone in reverse ....Global anxieties over nuclear weapons are the highest since the Cold War, and climate change is moving faster than we are. Inequalities are growing, and we see horrific violations of human rights. Nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise.\" Facing such challenges, Guterres said he was \"not issuing an appeal\" but a \"red alert for our world.\" Only international unity and cooperation, he stressed, could now help solve these many crises. As we begin 2018, I am issuing a red alert for our world. I call for unity--our future depends on it. pic.twitter.com/fWtTa1irM3--Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (@ antonioguterres) December 31, 2017 \"I truly believe we can make our world more safe and secure.

Bridge the divides. Rebuild trust by bringing people together around common goals. Unity is the path. Our future depends on it.\" Hours after Guterres' message, North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong Un</mark> issued a New Year's Day speech, in which he spoke of a \"nuclear button\" on his desk, ready for use if the hermit kingdom is threatened. \"The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat,\" he said, adding that he was \"open to dialogue\" with South Korea and emphasizing that \"these weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\" Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that the U.S. is \"closer to a nuclear war with North Korea\" than ever before.

A 180-year-old painting by Adelaide's planner Colonel William Light that was passed in at auction on Sunday has been sold to a private collector. The watercolour was created by Colonel Light between January and April 1837, around the time he surveyed and laid out the South Australian capital. It was expected to fetch upwards of $100,000 but attracted only one bid of $20,000. Art dealer <mark>Jim Elder</mark> confirmed on Tuesday that the work had since been purchased by a private collector who wanted to remain anonymous and who asked that the sale price not be disclosed. Mr <mark>Elder</mark> said he was bitterly disappointed the painting had passed into private hands. \"This important piece of South Australian history may not be seen again in public for generations,\" he said. \"It has been lost to South Australian society.\" The work spent the past 40 years stored in a camphor wood chest in a garage before being discovered recently by the owner's widow. Before the auction, Mr <mark>Elder</mark> said it was nothing short of a miracle that the painting had survived. \"This is one of the earliest depictions of Adelaide and thus carries significant weight with historians and art collectors alike,\" he said. The work shows a farmhouse with outbuildings and a surrounding settlement of tents and huts with colonists going about their business. Campfire smoke drifts through the gum trees as cattle graze in a nearby clearing. The Mount Lofty Ranges can be seen in the background beneath billowing white clouds. Mr <mark>Elder</mark> said painstaking art history and genealogical research traced the watercolour's provenance back 180 years to a man called Shimmin who worked as a gardener for Colonel Light's fellow surveyor William Jacob on Jacob's Barossa Valley property, Moorrooroo. It had remained in the Shimmin family for generations. Light was a prolific painter and sketcher, often selling his works to support himself, but many were destroyed by a fire at the Land and Survey Office and his adjacent hut in January 1839. He had arrived in the new colony in October 1836 and died of tuberculosis just three years later aged 53. Most of his known remaining works, including an incomplete self-portrait, are housed in the Art Gallery of South Australia, the State Library of South Australia and the Adelaide Town Hall.

i don't care what happens, the blues is gonna be here,\" said sumlin, 79, with a mischievous laugh. \"everything else is gonna die before the blues.\" hearing sumlin play--be it on old howlin' wolf recordings, his performances last year on a jimi hendrix tribute tour, or with the big head blues club--it's tempting to believe him. and when mohr reports that 95-year-old honeyboy edwards is a fixture on the tour bus, and that sumlin constantly regales him with stories from the road and has \"been like a father to me,\" that passing of the baton seems a bit more secure. sure, sumlin is engaging in howler-caliber hype when he insists that \"these big head todd and his monsters can play <mark>robert johnson</mark> as good as <mark>robert johnson</mark> hisself.\" but when mohr opens the gigs with a heartfelt acoustic rendition of \"love in vain\" or \"stones in my passway\" on dobro or guitar and vocal, it's apparent he's following the tradition while being true to himself and ever-conscious of the danger of becoming a charlatan. the same can be said of the other three members of big head todd and the monsters. ditto drummer cedric burnside, grandson of the late blues singer r.l. burnside and the 2010 blues music awards drummer of the year, who teams with slide guitarist lightnin' malcolm on the record and the current tour. that's malcolm stinging his slide behind honeyboy edwards, or on a solo rendition of a son house tune. without question, something precious will be lost with the passing of edwards, perkins, sumlin and others. but it has always been that way. meanwhile, something precious is also being savored, and retained. \"i told my producer, clive goldsmith, that i've been waiting 30 years to make this record,\" said mohr, who had a hit single when he and the monsters were joined by <mark>john lee</mark> hooker for a cover of hooker's classic blues \"boom boom,\" and who included the blues standard \"smokestack lightning\" on their last album in 2010. \"i am delighted to be in this period of rediscovery and enlightenment. the music i make [from now on] will always be affected by this. - the garfunkel-less hall of famer will perform at the minneapolis convention center's auditorium in lieu of northrop. your comment is being reviewed for inclusion on the site. startribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics. commenters must follow our terms of use. keep it civil and stay on topic. no profanity, vulgarity, racial slurs or personal attacks. comments that violate the above will be removed. repeat violators may lose their commenting privileges on startribune.com. car detective let us look for you. when a vehicle that matches your specifications is listed, search thousands of listings nationwide. listings include local foreclosures and upcoming open houses. healthcare careers exploration. education. your healthcare career awaits."}, {"articleID": "2014092620_00030892_W", "names": {"John Mayer": ["Q1699730", "Q21039156", "Q215215"], "Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]}, "date": "2014-09-26", "url": "http://news.com.au/national/victoria/tinder-craze-a-casual-sex-cesspool-or-a-swipe-right-for-true-love/story-fnii5sms-1227070498139", "content": "Tinder craze: A casual sex cesspool or a swipe right for true love? WITH 10 million users worldwide and about a million users in Australia, Tinder has become the go-to dating app for 20 and 30-somethings. But is finding true love really as simple as swiping right or is Tinder just a cesspool of casual sex? Apparently, it's a match. Time to plan the first date? Source: TheAustralian It was a weekday evening and Erica was at home in inner Melbourne, browsing through the latest faces and physiques on Tinder, when she spotted a family friend from primary school days. \"Our parents knew each other well and he and I played together,\" the 28-year-old says. \"We hadn't seen each other for at least 20 years. I recognised him instantly but it was obvious he didn't recognise me.\" I swiped right and so did he and we started texting. But within three texts he wrote, \"So, fancy a f--?' I didn't take that any further.\" Erica has had three Tinder dates with guys who've passed her unofficial selection test - she spends a few days texting and talking on the telephone to find out more before agreeing to a first date in a public venue. \"While you're texting and talking you can usually work out if they're crazy or married or if the spark isn't there,\" she says practically. \"My first Tinder date went well but then I got busy at work. When I messaged him a few weeks later I didn't hear back. The next guy I went out with was a bit quieter than the guys I usually go for but I liked him.\" But a few days later he sent me a message saying he'd met someone else. I respected his honesty and with Tinder there are always plenty more fish in the sea! \"I went on my last date at a bar in Brighton. The guy was about three inches shorter than me and while we got along well we both sensed it wasn't going to be a romance.\" DATING FROM YOUR LOUNGE ROOM Erica says Tinder is helpful in connecting people who have busy lives. \"Sometimes at the end of the day slapping on make-up, doing your hair and going out to dinner or to a bar is the last thing you want to do. With Tinder you can find people and chat without leaving home,\" she says \"I don't think you can expect to meet the love of your life anywhere - it will just happen. But by interacting with more people, it opens up your opportunities.\" Since it launched in late 2012, Tinder has more than 10 million users worldwide and has become the international go-to app for 20 and 30-somethings looking for friends, social opportunities, a date or, ahem, a little more. And Australia has embraced it with open arms. Tinder co-founder Sean Rad says Australia is the third largest user after the US and UK, though he won't confirm exactly how many people here use the app. For the dwindling number of people still unfamiliar with Tinder - mostly the 40-plus age group and those preoccupied with mortgages and kids - Tinder's technology allows people to use their mobile telephone to browse profile photos of other Tinder users within a set geographical distance from themselves. If you like the look of someone's photo you swipe right and they join your list of \"liked people\" . You swipe left to reject a profile and that person will never know you've rejected them. Hanging out at the bar on Tinder. Picture: Keryn Stevens Source: News Corp Australia KEEPING IT SIMPLE If the person you swipe right \"likes\" you too, then you can start chatting via text, phone or arrange to meet. \"Our vision was to make it more simple and organic to meet new people,\" Rad says. \"We put everyone on a level playing field and they figure out who wants to meet who. Initially we tested Tinder with college students because they're at a stage of their lives when meeting new people is top of mind.\" But it grew beyond that. It's become very mainstream now - people talk about Tinder on daytime TV. It has entered the fabric of pop culture. \"Modern-day icons of pop culture have been quick to jump on the Tinder trail, too. Katy Perry says she has been using it following her split this year from boyfriend of two years <mark>John Mayer</mark>. Singer Lily Allen says she has been looking at what Tinder has to offer (though this admission left her fans wondering about the state of her marriage). Earlier this year Shane Warne tweeted that he was debating whether to join Tinder. Warne made the tongue-in-cheek comment after ex-girlfriend Liz Hurley swiftly healed her broken heart with a new love. In response, Warne mused:\" It might be time to take up my single friends' suggestions and join Tinder! \"And Aussie singer Natalie Imbruglia says she's also considering the app.\" My girlfriend in London has fallen madly in love on her third Tinder date - and I'm incredibly jealous - everyone I know who's single in London is on Tinder, \"she said. AN EGO BOOST Rad says Tinder's core user group is 18 to 35-year-olds, fairly evenly split between men and women. He believes the app's popularity lies in the fact that\" you can make what you want out of it \".\" You can look for a date, for a short-term relationship, for a person to marry or a friend, \"he says.\" We're in the business of making that initial contact and what people then make of that is completely up to them. I think people initially start using Tinder because they want to see how many matches they can make - it's an ego booster, just like posting content on Instagram and seeing how many likes you get. \"But when you get a match on Tinder you could then meet a best friend or fall in love.\" Rad dismisses criticism that Tinder is superficial and encourages casual sex and disposable relationships. \"Yes, it is initially based on appearance but that's humanity, right? That first impression counts,\" he shrugs. \"That first impression is how we initially make contact whether we like that or not.\" THE TRAVEL APP Caroline Chagas, 30, a St Kilda business owner, has used Tinder when travelling. \"In Scotland recently I met a local guy through Tinder. He invited me to a gallery because we were both interested in art - though after we first matched and started texting he said he wanted to have sex,\" Chagas says. \"I told him that wasn't going to happen and 20 minutes later he messaged me and said the urge had passed and did I want to keep talking?\" So we kept texting and I made it very clear nothing would happen between us. But we went to the gallery and it was great to be in a new city with a local showing me around. \"Chagas is a recent recruit to Tinder after stories of instant hook-ups initially put her off.\" I'm not judging - but it's not something I do and often I tell guys that and don't hear from them again! \"she laughs.\" I think one of the worst things about Tinder is that in the process of using it I've found husbands of friends using it, too. That's pretty confronting. I see Tinder more as window shopping and if you're looking for a soulmate perhaps you should stay away. \"Doing what comes naturally. Pic Keryn Stevens Source: News Corp Australia HOOKING UP, BUT LONELY Relationships Australia's Melbourne manager Sue Yorston says Tinder fits well with a generation used to getting the information they need from technology.\" They are also an \"I' generation who've been told they can do and have what they want and they're an instant generation looking for instant gratification. I think people using Tinder aren't getting anything they don't expect out of it,\" she says. Yorston says the concept of dating has changed from a time when people often met a potential partner through work or friends and got to know them gradually. \"Dating isn't really in our vocabulary any more. Now people hook up,\" she says. \"Tinder is very instantaneous and I think it seems to be based more on popularity - people can start to judge themselves based on the number of\" likes' they get. \"So if I am using Tinder I exist and if I'm getting hook-ups and likes, someone is looking at me. I think the current generation of 20s and 30-somethings are often isolated. Our research has found the highest users of social media websites also scored highest on a scale of loneliness.\" As humans we can only thrive if we have that caring, nurturing personal contact. We need empathy, cuddles and care so we know that we matter to someone and that they have our interests at heart. \"JUST DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY University of Melbourne's School of Social and Political Sciences senior lecturer Dr Lauren Rosewarne believes apps like Tinder have taken off simply because it's a way to do more quickly what humans have strived to do for eons - connect with others.\" Tinder simply makes easier what is already happening offline: men and women connecting for friendship, romance or just sex. Therefore the same pitfalls and perils of the dating world - for both genders - exist in the context of Tinder, \"she says, referring to the risks of unwanted pregnancy, STIs, heartbreak and feelings of being exploited. However, she adds that with a larger time gap now between when people become sexually active - at around 17 - and when they marry in their late 20s or early 30s, it's to be expected that people will have more sexual partners, with or without the help of Tinder. But Rosewarne says double standards exist.\" Society as a whole still judges women more than they judge men when it comes to how many sexual partners they have. We have this fear of what will happen to society if women don't toe the line, \"she says.\" I think if you are using Tinder you have to keep your expectations modest. But if there weren't a place or a market for Tinder, people wouldn't be using it. \"There are 10 million users of Tinder worldwide. Picture: Keryn Stevens Source: News Corp Australia SAVING TIME AND MONEY Felix *, 32, works in contract management in Melbourne and has been on Tinder for six months - friends persuaded him to try the app after the end of a long-term relationship.\" I think a forte of Tinder is that it saves people time and money. If you go out to meet people. you might go to 10 bars or clubs in 10 different weeks and you're dropping money everywhere, \"he says.\" I've been on about 12 dates and most people have been quite nice. I tend to swap messages with someone over a week and then talk on the phone and if that person sounds interesting I take it from there. \"I've only had one weird Tinder experience - I arranged to meet a girl who was the opposite of the person I'd spoken to on the phone. I wasn't even certain she was the same person, actually. She was very full on and not the sort of person I'd want to catch up with at all.\" Felix is using Tinder to meet new people when he moves to Sydney this year. \"It's a great way to make connections in a new place - people have been advising me on where to live. For me, it's been more of a friend finder,\" he says. The brains behind Tinder: Justin Mateen and Sean Rad in <mark>Beverly Hills</mark>. Source: Supplied WEIRD DATES AND A WEDDING Chris *, 31, works in sales and began using Tinder about a year ago - it's a favourite pastime on a Friday night when he's out with mates. \"They're always keen to help me make a decision. I like the simplicity of it. I've used the Blendr app before but the downside of that is you could be texting someone and not know if they are interested or not,\" he says. \"With Tinder there's an immediate common ground but that can be a downfall. I think people can in the end be too personal and impolite. I haven't used Tinder for the quick\" wham, bam, thank you ma'am' and I think some girls now expect that. \"Chris has been on a dozen Tinder dates with mixed results.\" Early on I met a girl and I was two minutes late for our date but I sent her a text to let her know I was running behind. When I arrived the first thing she said was, \"what drink are you buying me?' There wasn't even a hello and she was preoccupied with everything else happening in the bar - I think she was interested in my wallet basically,\" he says. \"But I have been to a wedding of a couple who met through Tinder and I recently met a girl who is a generous and considerate person. So we'll see how that goes.\" * Some names have been changed Originally published as Do you swipe here often?"}, {"articleID": "2008120115_00039555_W", "names": {"Taj Mahal": ["Q353023", "Q59627566"],

183 people - at least 20 of them foreigners - and sparking global outrage, india has decided to intensify cooperation with security agencies of other countries, a move that is likely to put extra pressure on pakistan to come clean on its alleged links with the attacks. \"india does not have issues with seeking cooperation of intelligence agencies of other countries, specially in an incident like this in which foreign nationals are involved,\" official sources told ians. a federal bureau of investigation (fbi) team landed in mumbai sunday night. it has already surveyed the <mark>taj mahal</mark> palace and tower hotel which, along with the trident-oberoi hotel and nariman house, was the scene of the almost 61-hour long operation to flush out the terrorists who had seized the three buildings. the fbi team is reported to have traced an e-mail sent to lahore by the deccan mujahideen, a shadowy organization which has claimed responsibility for wednesday night's terror attacks that injured at least 325. besides the fbi, security teams from israel and britain are also in india to help investigation agencies here in unearthing the larger plot behind the mumbai carnage. the only terrorist captured by indian authorities following the mumbai attacks told his interrogators that he and the 10 other men in his group were sent specifically to kill israelis to avenge \"atrocities\" against the palestinians. six israelis, some dual citizens but all of them jews, were killed in the attack on the nariman house, also known as chabad house, one of the 10 targets hit by terrorists in a series of coordinated attacks across the city. amir kasab, 21, told investigators that this was why they targeted the chabad house, an outreach center meant for local jews and jews touring india, including israelis. india's polite declining of an israeli offer to send its elite counter-terror squad to end the siege of nariman house has been criticized by some sections of the israeli media. however, new delhi feels that it did the right thing by refusing the israeli assistance as this may have delayed the anti-terrorist operation. \"it would have required some time to brief israeli squads about the geography of the place and other issues relating to rules of engagement. besides, our people are as good as anybody else,\" official sources said. \"we can't have foreign troops carrying out anti-terror operations in our country. this is unacceptable,\" g. parthasarathy, a former indian envoy to pakistan, told ians. \"however, we must fully cooperate with intelligence agencies of other countries,\" he added. enlisting the assistance of foreign intelligence agencies will also help put extra pressure on pakistan to clear the air about those elements india suspects to behind the mumbai attacks, parthasarathy said. <mark>satish chandra</mark>, a former deputy national security adviser and also a former envoy to pakistan, agreed. \"this is call to be taken by security agencies only. we have good expertise in this area. we don't really need anybody's help,\" <mark>chandra</mark> told ians. the fbi team was briefly detained at the chattrapati shivaji international airport sunday night after customs officials refused to allow forensics equipment on board their aircraft on indian soil, sources in intelligence bureau said. however, senior raw officials said the team arrived here without providing prior lists of personnel and the specialised forensic equipment they were carrying. since customs officials in mumbai had no idea what the fbi team was carrying, they were asked about this. \"we do not want foreign investigating agencies to aid us in a probe which we are capable of handling. if we allow one agency to join the investigation it will lead to a precedent which we have been avoiding all these years,\" said a senior raw functionary. india had granted permission to the fbi to examine the sites involved in the mumbai terror attack since us nationals were also targeted. six americans were among the foreigners killed in the terror strikes. us president <mark>george bush</mark> has pledged his full support for the investigation into the attacks and will be sending secretary of state condoleezza rice to india wednesday for mutual consultations over the strikes. <mark>bush</mark> has assured prime minister <mark>manmohan singh</mark> that the us will provide all necessary resources and will work with the international community to bring those responsible for the bloodshed to justice."}, {"articleID":
