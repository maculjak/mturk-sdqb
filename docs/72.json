to moderate-income neighborhood back after years of decline. their ranks must grow to help sustain and expand the neighborhood's housing improvements and business growth, leaders say. a $1 million grant to help strengthen king irving and adjacent mondamin presidential neighborhood was provided by thrivent financial for lutherans in 2008. that money went toward housing improvements, block cleanups, public safety, youth programs and job opportunities .\" right now, the biggest challenge is getting more people involved, \"said robin hamel, project manager for thrivent builds neighborhoods. in the early 1900s, the neighborhood was home to various movie theaters, grocery stores, nightclubs, drug stores and filling stations. things started to slide in the 1960s, and king irving's population dropped by nearly one-third during the '70s. scores of abandoned, dilapidated houses and other buildings were razed. the demolitions eventually included irving junior high school, which closed in the 1970s. that site is now home to the forest avenue library and evelyn davis park. the neighborhood was left with more than 200 vacant lots, a problem the city, residents and nonprofit groups have fought over the past 10 years. vacant and foreclosed properties can weaken values of surrounding houses, spawn more foreclosures, attract squatters, vandals and thieves and become nuisances that threaten public safety, experts say. city officials estimate there are 1,770 vacant lots in des moines. sixty-two percent of the lots with development potential are in the northern half of the city, an analysis by city officials shows. king irving had 152 buildable, vacant lots seven years ago. there are 73 today. developing those lots is important to king irving and all of des moines because mature cities typically must grow from within .\" the suburbs build tax base by gaining ground and greenfield development, \"said <mark>taylor</mark>, the isu professor .\" the landlocked, core cities don't have those same opportunities, so they have to build tax base from within and invest in development on land that they already have. \"the king irving, mondamin presidential, river bend and cheat - om park neighborhoods north of downtown all stand to gain from downtown's ongoing renewal .\" the proximity to downtown is going to be a selling point, \"<mark>taylor</mark> said. the neighborhood rebound is also driven by the work of nonprofit organizations such as greater des moines habitat for humanity, home, inc., thrivent and the neighborhood finance corporation, which have focused heavily on the area's rebirth .\" i'm in it every single day and there have been significant changes, especially with the housing, \"said hamel, the thrivent coordinator. by the end of 2009, greater des moines habitat for humanity had finished 65 houses in the king irving and mondamin presidential neighborhoods, bringing $6 million of affordable housing to the area. over the past two years, the neighborhoods have also seen some $2 million in federal grant money to lessen the impact of foreclosures and redevelop vacant lots, a core recommendation in a 2004 king irving neighborhood improvement plan .\" the housing improvements have been key, \"said muldoon, president of the king irving neighborhood association. for instance, the assessed value of one property on the near north side increased from $7,100 to $127,600 when a house was built on a once-vacant lot. the neighborhood finance corporation has also made 51 loans to other nonprofits, developers and private homeowners totaling $3.75 million in the last several years. the loans have resulted in new construction, renovations, home purchases, refinances and second mortgages. the private investments bolster public improvements meant to spur revitalization. taxpayers have spent $1.8 million on street, curb and sidewalk improvements. sewer improvements in the area surpass $2 million. also, some $875,000 has been invested at evelyn davis park in the past several years to improve amenities, security and programs at the park, which some call the town square of the king irving neighborhood. money raised for the various initiatives has included grants from polk county, vision iowa and donations from local business leaders. about 100 people packed into the steamy gymnasium at king elementary school last month to discuss problems in and around evelyn davis park. a week earlier, residents had rallied to make a statement and stake their claim to the 9.8-acre park located at 1400 forest ave. the park is named after a community leader and longtime advocate for children and the poor who died in 2001. turmoil near the park often crops up in the spring, but incidents earlier this year were exceptional, area residents have said. since then, residents and various community groups have held every meeting and activity they can in the park .\" even if good things have been happening for years, one bad thing can overshadow that progress, \"hamel said. the city's parks department has daily activities at evelyn davis park for children through mid-august. in addition, police have also stepped up patrols. two officers are in the park from 4 p.m. until closing time on fridays through sundays. the results?\" so far, so good, \"said des moines police lt. <mark>joe gonzalez</mark>.\" more people and neighborhood organizations have been using the park a lot more frequently, which makes a difference. \"don mayberry, who lives on carpenter avenue across the street from the park, agreed .\" regardless of what people might read or hear, this is a safe neighborhood, \"said mayberry, who's lived in the area for about 50 years. crime patterns in the king irving area have been on par with most other parts of the city over the past 60 days, city data show. residents say things have been quiet .\" it's no different than any other neighborhood in the city, \"<mark>gonzalez</mark> said .\" sometimes things can flare up. \"residents are committed to keeping the park - their town square - safe because its vitality is a symbol for everything they've worked for all these years. they don't dismiss or downplay problems that shook the area just two months ago, meade said. they simply refuse to let the incidents define them or their neighborhood. you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment. paris lam, 4, cools off in the fountains at des moines' evelyn davis park on monday evening. her father, thu lam, has lived in the king irving neighborhood for 18 years. king irving neighborhood at a glance population: three-fourths of the neighborhood's 2,163 residents are minorities, according to the 2000 u.s. census, the most recent data available. nearly 38 percent of the neighborhood's residents are 18 or younger; citywide, 25 percent are 18 or younger. forty-three percent of households are headed by single mothers, compared to 27 percent citywide. income: median household income levels in the king irving neighborhood increased by 17 percent between 2000 and 2009, from $22,429 to $26,259, according to census and market research data. polk county median incomes increased 20 percent, from $46,517 to $55,837, during the same time. features: home to the forest avenue library, evelyn davis park, the john r. grubb ymca, and martin luther king, jr. academy of math and science. polk county's central senior center is just outside the neighborhood's west boundary line on forest avenue. casady school: residents in the king irving and mondamin presidential neighborhoods have urged school district officials to keep the casady school in use. the building currently houses preschool and alternative high school programs. bill good, the district's chief operations officer, said he expects those uses to continue in the building for about five years. architecture: the neighborhood's dominant architecture style is arts & crafts, including bungalow and four-square style homes. historic places: the neighborhood is home to the basilica of st. john, listed on the national register of historic places. also on the historic register: the goddard bungalow court located west of 14th street and north of university avenue. isu football: <mark>david sims</mark> being investigated for unlawful use of credit card will dam failure be end of lake delhi? culver might seek fema aid one killed, 23 injured after spooked horses trample crowd at bellevue parade more detail: wells fargo cuts division, plus 3,800 jobs nationwide seven central iowa dishes that might each deliver enough view more than 200 photos from the 2008 floods from all across iowa. view more than 200 photos from the biggest lazerfest in its history. place an ad copyright? 2010 the des moines register. all rights reserved. use of this site signifies your agreement to the", "articleID": "2010072710_00242289_W", "names": {"David Sims": ["Q3703336", "Q5239819", "Q5239820", "Q5239821"], "Gary Taylor": ["Q16886047", "Q1801939", "Q5526044", "Q5526045", "Q5526046", "Q5526047", "Q5526048"], "Joe Gonzalez": ["Q20993665", "Q22680673"]}}, {"date": "2010-07-27", "url": "http://highheelsathomeplate.wordpress.com/2010/07/27/all-star-lineup-change/", "content": "july 27, 2010...9:02 am all star lineup change scott woodward, who earned himself the lead-off spot for the cape cod baseball league all stars west division team, will not be playing in the game on wednesday at fenway park due to an injury to his foot that he sustained in a game earlier this week. he will be replaced by bourne teammate daniel bowman, who had earned himself a spot in the home run hitting contest at fenway and will now be a reserve as well. woodward will be replaced as lead-off by <mark>chad wright</mark> (cotuit). the lineups are now as follows: 2010 ccbl western division starting line-up 1. cf <mark>chad wright</mark> cotuit kettleers (kentucky) 2. lf johnny ruetigger hyannis harbor hawks (arizona state) 3. rf zach wilson wareham gatemen (arizona state) 4. dh jordan leyland cotuit kettleers (cal. -
