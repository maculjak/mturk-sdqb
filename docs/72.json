up 8.5 per cent from 2010-2011 - and total spending of $10.67-billion, which is up 5.5 per cent. that leaves a surplus of $115-million in the general revenue fund. on a summary basis, which takes into account all areas of government including crown corporations, the surplus is expected to be $54.3-million. the government plans to take $325-million from its rainy-day savings account to pay down general revenue fund debt. the payment brings the debt to $3.81-billion - the lowest level since 1987-88. it's different than last year when the government tabled a budget where spending outpaced revenue and the province relied on savings to keep the books in the black. but the opposition new democrats argued the budget doesn't go far enough to help low-income people, seniors on fixed incomes or students. \"for all the money that's being announced, it lacks vision and i don't find it very inspiring,\" said ndp leader dwain lingenfelter. \"it will impact some, but my sense is that the families, many of them who we've been talking to up in the flooded area, won't be paying any income tax this year because they have no income. or many people who are on low or minimum income, who aren't paying any income tax, aren't going to feel the benefit of this budget at all .\" the ndp also raised concerns about growing crown debt, which budget documents suggest will increase by $810 million. other reaction to the budget was mixed. the saskatchewan urban municipalities association said getting one point of the pst gives communities revenue predictability, which allows for better future planning. the saskatchewan chamber of commerce said \"it's a pretty good budget,\" but the government could have gone further on property tax breaks. \"it's clearly an election budget. there's little bits and pieces for everybody. everybody should at least have an appetizer-size feeling that they've achieved something here,\" said chamber ceo steve mclellan. \"they're moving in the right direction and the minister said,\" we've taken some steps forward. we're sending the message that property tax is important .' but at the end of the day, i would like to have seen this to be a very significant step forward. it's an election year - we didn't see that. \"but it was anti-poverty advocates who were most upset. they noted there's just $1.7-million for two new initiatives to create affordable housing in saskatchewan .\" i really think it's quite unbelievable that at a time of an economic boom and massive resource wealth that there's really so little in this budget for low-income people, to improve the pocketbook of low-income people, \"said peter gilmer with the regina anti-poverty ministry .\" this is really a very limited response to the housing crisis in the province right now. \"mr. gilmer said the income tax break won't help either .\" you have to have a significant income to make ends meet. a tax cut on nothing is nothing, \"said mr. gilmer .\" we need to improve people's incomes. we also have to make sure that their cost for basic needs like housing are affordable and this budget, quite frankly, doesn't do that. \"there are also some concerns about unbudgeted expenses down the road, including contracts with labour groups or potential disasters. the watershed authority has already warned there's a high likelihood of flooding again this year, especially in southern saskatchewan. disclaimer? copyright 2011 the globe and mail inc. all rights reserved. m5v 2s9 phillip crawley, publisher"}, {"articleID": "2015080918_00066017_W", "names": {"Michael Brown": ["Q10456471", "Q11936682", "Q1328702", "Q15522038", "Q17516932", "Q1779573", "Q18344346", "Q18719315", "Q26915320", "Q27914049", "Q295684", "Q30123102", "Q336303", "Q3857364", "Q458065", "Q47487885", "Q50143349", "Q50978985", "Q55998905", "Q57392216", "Q57413534", "Q6828857", "Q6828858", "Q6828861", "Q6828864", "Q6828865", "Q6828867", "Q6828868", "Q6828870", "Q6828871", "Q786003"], "Darren Wilson": ["Q17543917", "Q5225246", "Q5225247"], "Christian Taylor": ["Q1751", "Q5110185", "Q5110187"]}, "date": "2015-08-09", "url": "http://news.sky.com/story/1532938", "content": "Play video \"Ferguson's Tribute To <mark>Michael Brown</mark>\" Video: Ferguson's Tribute To <mark>Michael Brown</mark> Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google + Share on Whatsapp Share by email By Sky News US Team Several hundred people have gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, to mark one year since the death of <mark>Michael Brown</mark>. Crowds of white and black people marched to remember the black teenager whose shooting by a police officer sparked a national debate on race and justice. They observed four-and-a-half minutes of silence at midday to represent the roughly four-and-a-half hours the 18-year-old's body lay in the middle of the street after he was shot. Two doves were released at the end. <mark>Michael Brown</mark>'s death spawned the Black Lives Matter movement The crowd then began a silent march from the spot where the unarmed <mark>Brown</mark> was fatally shot by Ferguson officer <mark>Darren Wilson</mark> on 9 August last year. A service commemorating the anniversary was held at a church in the St Louis suburb.

Mr <mark>Brown</mark> Snr said his family is still grieving, but he believes his son's legacy can be seen in the increased awareness of police shootings. \"Everybody grieves differently,\" he told Sky News. \"I hurt every day .\" People know what happened was just wrong and all they are doing is just showing their respect and their love as for what has happened right here in this community. \"Mr <mark>Brown</mark> Sr also led a parade of several hundred people on Saturday.

But the shooting spawned the Black Lives Matter movement, which focuses on cases of unarmed young black men shot by police. Another name was added to that list on Friday when 19-year-old <mark>Christian Taylor</mark>, a black Texas college student, was shot dead by a white police officer responding to a burglary report. <mark>Brown</mark> had graduated from high school weeks before the shooting and planned to go to trade school to study to become an air conditioning technician.

Britain will go to the polls on December 12 AFP via Getty \"The Bank has a very important job and, as Governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does,\" he added. The Treasury revealed that, in order to \"provide for a smooth transition\" , Mr Carney would extend his term until mid-March, at which point his successor will officially take charge. Mr <mark>Bailey</mark> has been appointed on an eight-year contract and will receive a salary of \u00a3 495,000. The search for the 121st governor began in April, with London School of Economics director Minouche Shafik, Santander UK chairwoman Shriti Vadera and a former member of the US Federal Reserve's board of governors, Kevin Warsh, also in contention to replace Mr Carney. Although Mr <mark>Bailey</mark> is viewed as a safe pair of hands on account of his experience as head of the City watchdog, The Independent understands that there is concern within the Bank that \"nothing will change\" under the 60-year-old. Ms Shafik, who served as the deputy governor between August 2014 and February 2017, was among the favourites to succeed Mr Carney. The decision to overlook the 57-year-old has been met with \"disappointment\" among some insiders at the Bank. Shadow chancellor <mark>John McDonnell</mark> expressed his concern over the appointment, tweeting: \"As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA <mark>Andrew Bailey</mark> will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy & like Mark Carney understands the climate change threat .\" Mr Carney, who twice extended his tenure, was the first non-Briton to be become governor of the Bank of England. The Canadian succeeded Sir <mark>Mervyn King</mark> in July 2013 and later said he would stay for an extra year after his tenure ended--until June 2018--but was then persuaded by then chancellor <mark>Philip Hammond</mark> to extend his term by another seven months to help ease disruption from Brexit.

with the fifth and reportedly final season of \"supernatural\" starting tonight, september 10th, 2009, on the cw, what better time to sing the praises of this often clever and always underrated show via a review of the recently released fourth season blu-ray and dvd editions? if you've never seen \"supernatural\" start at the beginning, but if you've seen the first three seasons, don't give up on number four. blu-ray rating: 4.0 / 5.0 by its fourth year, \"supernatural\" had settled into a confident, unpredictable groove, beautifully weaving individual urban legends in a mystery-of-the-week format while also telling an interesting overall story. of course, i don't expect to see \"supernatural\" on ten-best lists next to shows like \"lost\" or \"mad men,\" but there's something to be said for a show that's been consistently entertaining for four years and counting. \"supernatural\" has been incredibly entertaining. \"supernatural\" works for the same two reasons that most shows succeed - quality writing and an effective ensemble to deliver it. if the show has a weakness, it's that they've never quite developed the supporting ensemble effectively but the two leads - jared padalecki and, particularly, jensen ackles - have gotten better every year. supernatural: the complete fourth season was released on blu-ray and dvd on september 1st, 2009. photo credit: warner brothers home video padalecki and ackles play sam and dean winchester, respectively, a pair of supernatural investigators, men trying to come to terms with both the details of their own dark pasts and with the constant battle between heaven and hell. dean knows a thing or two about the latter as the third season ended with him literally being dragged to the fiery underneath. of course, there's no show without dean and the more rebellious of the winchester brothers finds himself back on solid ground at the beginning of the fourth season of \"supernatural,\" sometimes accompanied by an angel who reports that god himself needed dean back in the real world for an important battle to come. why? dean will play a role in the stopping of the ultimate villain in the history of the show, lucifer himself. so, sam and dean are back traveling the world and stopping the forces of the supernatural wherever they go with a group of writers who seem downright inspired by being able to weave issues of classical angels and demons into the overall fabric of the show. knowing that the overall arc of the season would be incredibly dark, the mysteries of the week in \"supernatural\" display a lighter tone in season four, including battles with a 7-foot teddy bear and an episode that opens with dean running in terrified fear from a tiny dog. what's great about \"supernatural\" is how quickly the show can turn on itself. take for example the great \"it's the great pumpkin, sam winchester,\" which opens by playing with the urban legend of razor blades in halloween candy, hinting at a lighter-toned episode, but becomes both honestly scary and one of the more important episodes in the character arcs of the entire season. watching the fourth season of \"supernatural,\" i was struck by two thoughts - one, that the show has arguably never been more consistently entertaining (in part due to the switch in focus from sam to dean and the developed acting ability of ackles), and, two, that i'll be disappointed if the fifth season is truly the last. if one of your favorite shows is coming to blu-ray and dvd, you should hope that warner brothers is the studio releasing it. they do tv on blu-ray right. \"supernatural\" looks amazing in hd and even the dvd version is better than average technically for the format. blu-ray 1080p is absolutely the way to go - the video and audio are flawless - but if you haven't jumped to the next-gen format yet, the standard dvd looks much better than average. the special features on \"supernatural\" are the same on blu-ray and dvd and are presented in high definition on the former. special features include the 3-section featurette \"the mythologies of supernatural from heaven to hell,\" extended/unaired scenes, gag reel, and the following commentary tracks: episode 4.3 \"in the beginning\" - executive producer eric kripke and writer jeremy carver episode 4.21 \"when the levee breaks\" - writer sera gamble and director <mark>robert singer</mark> episode 4.22 \"lucifer rising\" - writer/director eric kripke \"supernatural: the complete fourth season' is released by warner brothers home video and stars jared padalecki and jensen ackles. it was created by eric kripke. the fourth season was released on september 1st, 2009. it is not rated and runs 924 minutes. by brian tallerico content director hollywoodchicago.com brian @ hollywoodchicago.com chicago -

This week, Brian X. Chen, the Times's personal technology writer, filled in for Mike. Farhad: Hello, Brian! You're stepping in for Mike this week because he has again locked himself out of the office. You really can't count on that guy. So thank you for filling in. Anyway, I wanted to start with some real talk: Science news is very cool right now. You must have seen how astronomers discovered seven Earth-size planets orbiting a star just 40 light years away. Meanwhile, physicists are puzzling over how quickly the universe is expanding; it seems to be going faster than physics predicts it should, which could be a clue that our understanding of the universe is missing something. I don't have any jokes here. I just think this stuff is awesome. Brian: Forty light years is pretty far away. I was hoping I could find another planet to live on for the next four to eight years. I guess I'll have to settle for Vancouver. Farhad: Eh, Canada. O.K., things picked up in the tech industry this week. For the first time in a long time, there was some news that didn't have anything to do with <mark>Donald Trump</mark>. Instead, it pretty much all had to do with Uber.

Apple has named the new campus Apple Park, and it has named the campus auditorium after Jobs. The building will house 12,000 employees. I bet more than a few of them will have roller-skate races around the huge circular hallways. Steve Jobs Presents to the Cupertino City Council (6/7/11) Video by Cupertino City Channel Brian: Apple's campus renovations are long overdue. Have you tried to find parking there recently? It's a nightmare--the place is flooded with Teslas and Mustangs. Anyway, Apple's chief executive, <mark>Tim Cook</mark>, has been talking about this new campus for years now. The way it's shaped--kind of like a U.F.O.--is supposed to foster stronger collaboration between different departments across Apple, whereas historically the divisions (hardware, software, special projects, Apple Minivan or whatever the heck they're doing, iOS, Mac, etc.) have been very siloed. Let's see if that happens. (Maybe one day we'll be able to plug the iPhone charging cable into the ports on the new MacBook Pros--what a concept .) Farhad: If it takes a $5 billion building to eliminate dongles, I'm all for it. So a shocking thing happened this week: A subsidiary of Facebook copied a feature from Snapchat. I'm sorry, I should be above easy sarcasm as a joke. But this week the president used \"NOT!\" in a tweet, and it took me back to the fourth grade. Remember when people used to say, \"Psych?\" Brian: Tcha. I mean, totes. Farhad: Anyway, WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased for more than $19 billion a few years ago, r olled out a number of features this week that borrow heavily from Snapchat. This follows another Facebook-owned app, Instagram, rolling out Stories, a way to make collections of short videos that Snapchat also pioneered. I have no problem with this; as I've argued repeatedly, I think it's generally good for consumers and innovation online when companies freely copy each other's best software ideas. Still, it's got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas. As a columnist, I know that feeling well. Brian: Tell me about it. I just did my third advice column on phone plans in the last two years. Anyway, I'm used to social media giants cloning each other's features, but I don't think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Privacy Policy People loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp's new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these? I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I'm not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use. Farhad: WhatsApp is great because it just works without any fuss. This all feels like a big fuss. Now let's talk Uber. What a cluster. So, last weekend, a former Uber engineer named Susan Fowler published a lengthy blog post in which she went into lots of detail about sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. She described a culture in which women were treated terribly and the human resources department did nothing. Then Mike, our Uber beat writer, published a really good piece detailing a whole bunch of other explosive stories about the company's unrestrained culture. Then on Thursday, another shoe dropped: Waymo, a unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, filed suit against Uber. Waymo said that a former member of Google's self-driving car project stole thousands of technical documents about the project before starting Otto, his own company--which Uber bought last year. And all this follows another controversy at Uber--C.E.O. Travis Kalanick's one-time plan to join a presidential advisory council, which led to an outcry from employees and customers. Uber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it's not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally. So, where do you think this goes next? Brian: As these things often tend to go, Uber is going to be in damage-control mode for the coming months. It will probably release the results of the investigation and announce a mandatory sexual harassment training program for its employees. Mike's reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber's response--\"We are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone\" --is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture. Their next step, PR-wise, is to show the steps they are taking to \"heal .\" Farhad: I think that was the plan, but the script is already falling apart. Two of Uber's early investors, Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, published an open letter to Kalanick expressing their disappointment in how Uber has handled the crisis so far. The company has tasked <mark>Eric Holder</mark>, the former attorney general under President Obama, to lead an investigation into its culture. But the investors--who have long fought for better representation of women in tech companies--say that such an investigation will not be truly independent. \"To us, this decision is yet another example of Uber's continued unwillingness to be open, transparent and direct,\" they said. This is something new in tech--you don't ordinarily see investors calling out their companies. So it seems like Uber is going to have to do something much bigger and less superficial here.... I think. Brian: What an epic disaster. I guess Travis will have to make his employees do more than a few trust falls before they recover from this one. Farhad: This is one of those sagas that might never end. Well, thanks for being Mike this week, Brian. Brian: No problem. Did I sound childish enough? Smell ya later.

In an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Wednesday, Erdogan also called on Western leaders to learn from \"the courage, leadership and sincerity\" of New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and \"embrace Muslims living in their respective countries .\" The opinion piece's headline read: \"The New Zealand killer and the Islamic State are cut from the same cloth .\" Erdogan said the West \"must reject the normalization of racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia .\" Separately, the Turkish president has been criticized for showing excerpts from video of the mosque attacks and for comments about the Gallipoli campaign in World War I. ___ 6 p.m.. A father and son who fled the civil war in Syria for \"the safest country in the world\" have been buried before hundreds of mourners, the first funerals for victims of shootings at two mosques in New Zealand that horrified a nation known for being welcoming and diverse. The funerals Wednesday of 44-year-old Khalid Mustafa and 15-year-old Hamza Mustafa came five days after a white supremacist methodically gunned down 50 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch--a massacre that he broadcast live on Facebook. Hamza's high school principal described the student as compassionate and hardworking, and said he was an excellent horse rider who aspired to be a veterinarian. ___ 5:25 p.m. New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush says he believes police officers stopped the gunman who killed 50 people at two mosques on his way to another attack. Bush says they believe they know where the gunman was going but won't say more because it's an active investigation. In a 74-page manifesto he released before the attack, accused Australian gunman Brenton Tarrant said he was going to attack mosques in Christchurch and Linwood, and then one in the town of Ashburton if he made it that far. Bush also revised his timeline, saying officers rammed the suspect off the road and arrested him 21 minutes after the first emergency call rather than 36 minutes. Bush says FBI agents have traveled to New Zealand to help with the investigation. ___ 4 p.m. Australia's prime minister says he has asked the Turkish president to withdraw his accusation of an anti-Islam motive behind Australia and New Zealand sending troops to Turkey in the World War I Gallipoli campaign. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was denouncing Islamophobia after an Australian was arrested in the killings of 50 worshippers in two mosques in New Zealand. Australian Prime Minister <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> said \"all options are on the table\" if Erdogan does not withdraw his comments. Turkish ambassador Korhan Karakoc said he had a \"frank\" conversation with <mark>Morrison</mark> when the envoy was summoned to Parliament House on Wednesday. Thousands of Australian and New Zealand citizens gather at the Gallipoli peninsula on April 25 each year to commemorate the start of the failed British-led campaign in 1915 to open a new front in the war against Germany. ___ 3:10 p.m.. A man accused of sharing video of a massacre in New Zealand has been jailed by a judge until his next court appearance in mid-April. Philip Arps, 44, appeared in a Christchurch court Wednesday on two charges of distributing the killer's livestream video of last week's attack on Al Noor mosque, a violation of the country's objectionable publications law. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. Arps, heavily tattooed and dressed in a T-shirt and sweatpants, hasn't entered a plea. He remained expressionless during the hearing, his hands clasped behind his back. Judge Stephen O\u2019Driscoll denied him bail. Charging documents accuse Arps of distributing the video on Saturday, one day after the massacre. ___ 1:15 p.m.. The first two people to be buried after last week's mosque attacks that killed 50 people are a father and his son. Khalid Mustafa was 44 and Hamza Mustafa was 15. The teen was a student at Cashmere High School and was compassionate and hard-working, according to the principal <mark>Mark Wilson</mark>. Hamza was an excellent horse rider who aspired to be a veterinarian, <mark>Wilson</mark> says. Hamza's younger brother Zaed, 13, suffered gunshot wounds to the leg in the attack. Mourners on Wednesday carried the bodies to a freshly dug gravesite, where hundreds gathered around to watch. Some were invited to scoop handfuls of dirt on top of the bodies. Authorities spent four days constructing a special grave at a city cemetery that is designated for Muslim burials. ___ 12:35 p.m.. The first funeral for two of 50 victims of last week's shootings at two mosques in New Zealand has begun. Hundreds of people are at the services in Christchurch. The identity of the victims was not immediately known. Authorities spent four days constructing a special grave at a city cemetery that is designated for the Muslim burials. An Australian white supremacist killed 50 worshippers in two mosques last Friday. ___ 11:50 a.m. Australia's Prime Minister <mark>Scott Morrison</mark> says he will protest to the Turkish ambassador on Wednesday against the Turkish president's accusation of an anti-Islam motive behind Australia and New Zealand sending troops to Turkey in the World War I Gallipoli campaign. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was denouncing Islamophobia after an Australian white supremacist killed 50 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch. <mark>Morrison</mark> said the comments were not helpful. Thousands of Australian and New Zealand citizens gather at the Gallipoli peninsula on April 25 each year to commemorate the start of the failed British-led campaign in 1915 to open a new front in the war against Germany. ___ 11:30 a.m. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has visited a school where two boys killed in last week's mosque attacks were students. In a speech at Cashmere High School, Ardern renewed her call for people to focus on the victims rather than the perpetrator. She says there will be interest in the terrorist but asked the students not to say his name or dwell on him. The Cashmere High students killed were 14-year-old Sayyad Milne and 15-year-old Hamza Mustafa. A third Cashmere student, Mustafa's 13-year-old brother Zaed, is recovering from gunshot wounds to his leg. ___ 10:45 a.m. Wednesday New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush says police have now formally identified and released the bodies of 21 people out of the 50 who were killed in last week's mosque attacks. Bush said that releasing the bodies was a priority for family reasons, compassionate reasons and cultural reasons. Islamic law says that people should be buried as soon as possible after death, preferably within 24 hours. Bush's comments came after it was announced that the first two burials of the victims are scheduled to take place Wednesday morning. He says they hope to finish formally identifying most victims by the end of the day although some will take longer.

While Queensland doesn't care how many Blues fans turn out for game three, having already wrapped up the series 2-0 for the 10th time in 11 years, Thurston said Gallen deserved better than to play his 23rd Origin, the most by any NSW forward, in front of a half-empty stadium. The Blues haven't pulled a crowd of less than 80,000 at home since 2010 when 61,259 fans turned out to see Queensland complete Origin's last clean sweep. NRL officials are worried the crowd may struggle to top 60,000 and are urging rugby league fans to say farewell to Gallen .\" It will be a real shame if their captain runs out in front of 60,000, \"Thurston said .\" He's played over 20 Origin games for them, it would be sad, I think. \"Regardless, Thurston said he expected the Blues to come out all guns blazing .\" It's Gal's last game and apparently Robbie's (Farah) last game, so they'll come out fired up and play well, which will be a real challenge for us, \"he said .\" I've only been part of one whitewash (2010) and we have all got a chance to be part of something special on Wednesday night. \"They've got a lot to play for too. The pressure is on them, they're under the pump .\" Thurston said whoever coach Laurie Daley picked opposite him in the No. 6 jumper--Matt Moylan or Jack Bird--they would be \"dangerous\". \"Matt is more of a ball player while Jack is a ball runner,\" Thurston said. With <mark>Corey Parker</mark> the latest member of the team to retire on Wednesday night, Thurston admitted it felt like his own Origin career was winding down. \"It seems like it is starting to come to an end but I am still loving it like my first series. It's quite special and I know I will miss it when that day comes,\" he said. \"Cozza (<mark>Parker</mark>) hasn't said anything to the boys and those that know him know he won't. He'll just go about his business .\" The best way for us to send him out the way he deserves is to prepare the best we can and play the best we can. \"johnathan thurston Read More Login to follow new south wales blues Read More Login to follow origin2016 Read More Login to follow paul gallen Read More Login to follow Topics: johnathan thurston, new south wales blues, origin2016, paul gallen 0 PRINT Have your say"}]
