Subscribe to our daily newsletter Sign UpThe Church Wicketts pub, one of the buildings Telford & Wrekin Council said the extension could have negatively impacted. Photo: Google Maps Mr and Mrs J Murfin applied for permission to build a conservatory at the side of their home at Church Road, Dawley, but Telford and Wrekin Council's planning department refused permission in August. But, after a site visit last week, government-appointed planning inspector Robert Hitchcock has overturned that appeal and allowed the development. Council planners had said the conservatory, which would be visible from the street, would be \"incongruous\" , but, in a Planning Inspectorate decision notice, Mr Hitchcock points out that nearby homes are already significantly altered, and the area no longer has \"consistent rhythm or character\". Mr Hitchcock writes that the Murfins' home is in \"an area of mixed age and character dwellings, including traditional semi-detached and detached properties intertwined with more modern terraces, individually-styled properties and infill development\". He adds: \"The proposed development would not appear incongruous or adversely affect any consistent rhythm or character of development within the locality .\" An appraisal document, prepared by council planning officers at the time of the original refusal, said the proposed conservatory, being visible from the street, would be an \"incongruous addition\". It also said \"the proposed scheme would have a detrimental impact upon the setting, character and appearance of surrounding local interest buildings, distracting from the historic character of the surrounding area\". Mr Hitchcock says this refers to a semi-detached pair of homes next to the Murfins' house and The Church Wicketts, a pub opposite. \"The buildings' significance stems from their forming part of an earlier 19th-century settlement, now incorporated within the wider Malinslee suburb,\" he writes. He adds that, while the conservatory would narrow the gap between the houses, a \"visual break\" would remain and \"no direct physical effect\" on the next-door house would result. In his decision notice, published on Monday, Mr Hitchcock allowed Mr and Mrs Murfin's appeal but said they must use approved building materials on the external surface \"in the interest of the character and appearance of the area\" .", "articleID": "2019121020_00134639_W", "names": {"Alex Moore": ["Q21104247", "Q28658001"]}}, {"date": "2019-12-11", "url": "http://uspolitics.einnews.com/article/504568984/Yd-02WSQ1-bpGm1J", "content": "https: //www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Warren-s-new-ocean-plan-includes-Western-drought-14896771.php Warren pushes back against more moderate path to White House Scott Sonner, Associated Press Updated 1:09 am EST, Wednesday, December 11, 2019 Sen.

(AP)--Pushing back against fellow Democrats who advocate a more moderate path to the White House, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday her party will lose the 2020 presidential election if it settles for an agenda that's \"business as usual\" and only \"nibbles around the edges\" of past U.S. policies. The Massachusetts senator said in a speech at a community college in Reno that her progressive campaign has the \"big ideas\" the country needs, including a 2% wealth tax on incomes over $50 million and Medicare for All. She also told the crowd of more than 600 in the biggest gold producing state in the U.S. that in addition to ending all new drilling and mining on federal lands, she would give Native American tribes veto power over pipelines and other development with environmental impacts on lands adjacent to their tribal lands. \"This country is in a crisis,\" Warren said at the close of a speech that devoted about half of her nearly 90-minute appearance to answering questions from audience members. Polls show former Vice President Joe Biden with a slight lead in Nevada over Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden has been critical of both for pushing agendas he believes are overly ambitious and too costly, including Medicare for All. Warren didn't name any of her Democratic rivals during Tuesday night's speech but took direct aim at such concerns. \"Party insiders...think that somehow that running a vague campaign that nibbles around the edges on these huge problems is a safe strategy,\" Warren said. \"If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after <mark>Donald Trump</mark>, then Democrats will lose. When we have ideas big enough to meet the problems in people's lives, that's when we win .\" An individual's first $50 million of income would be exempt from Warren's proposed wealth tax, with 2% levied on every dollar after that and an additional 1% surcharge above $1 billion. She estimates it would raise $800 billion annually. Earlier Tuesday, Warren updated her strategy to combat climate change with a focus on protecting ocean habitat as well as Western drought and wildfires. She released her plan for The New Blue Deal Tuesday as an addendum to the Green New Deal following a gathering with a powerful casino workers' union in Las Vegas Monday night. Th addition is mostly directed at ways to address how climate change is affecting oceans, including expanding protection of marine areas and prohibiting new offshore drilling in federal waters. But it also highlights the need for new plans to ease the stress on critical water supplies like the Colorado River basin, where drops in reservoir levels forced mandatory water cuts this summer in Arizona and Nevada. Sanders appeared before the Culinary Workers in Las Vegas Tuesday after stops in Carson City, Reno and Elko the past two days. Biden plans to meet with the union in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

It took <mark>Brett Maher</mark> missing 10 field goals in his second year with the club for him to finally be dismissed, leaving the team with a 2019 accuracy rate of 66.7 percent, which includes an abysmal 20 percent accuracy between 40-49 yards and 50 percent from 50 yards or more. Enter Kai Forbath, after a successful workout on Monday. Although he lacks the leg strength of his predecessor to boot it from 60 yards out, the 32-year-old does boast a higher career accuracy than <mark>Maher</mark> across distances, and he most recently went 5 for 6 from 50 yards or greater as a member of the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. who was signed this week in <mark>Maher</mark>'s place Plot twist cometh. It's not Forbath's first stint with the Cowboys, having been signed as an undrafted free agent in 2011. Sidelined by injury that summer, he was released and the nod was given to a fellow undrafted rookie named Dan Bailey, who went on to become a legend in Dallas before being replaced by <mark>Maher</mark> in 2018. Bailey now takes up residence for the same Vikings that employed Forbath one year prior to Bailey being cut in Dallas. Forbath's career took a much different arc after 2011, needless to say, going on to play for six different teams--his last being the New England Patriots--before finding his way back to North Texas, and he's bringing with him a career accuracy rate of 85.5 percent and a list of valuable lessons learned .\" Yeah, that's what I learned from college to the NFL, \"Forbath said .\" You have to take every single day serious and treat it like a game and try to get better every day. When you get complacent and take practice for granted, that's when things go bad. \"Even if Forbath is flawless from here on out (doubtful in today's landscape of kickers), it will have only resolved one of the many issues holding the Cowboys back from realizing their full potential in 2019. Sitting at 6-7 and barely clinging onto the NFC East lead, they need to fix everything from coaching issues to inconsistent play calling to disheveled play on the field and lack of takeaways if they're truly going to right the ship and make a possible run into and through the playoffs. Kicking matters, however, as the Cowboys have recently been reminded time and again. To his credit, Forbath, who's been around the block, says the workout was more stressful than kicking in the actual game will be .\" It might be more [pressure in the tryout] actually, \"he said .\" There's very important people watching you kicking each kick. I told my agent I got through the hard part and now let's go make some kicks. \"The potentially good news here is the Cowboys will no longer crutch their offense on the belief they can stroll out <mark>Maher</mark> for a 63-yard kick or a 58-yarder on an opening drive, instead potentially opting to now be more aggressive and push the ball downfield. That's ideally speaking, but whenever Forbath does take the field for his Cowboys debut on Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams, the silence he'll hear will be 100,000 people refusing to breathe until the ball sails through the uprights. And it he whiffs, it'll be 100,000 people calling for his head. But hey, no pressure.

Journey times will be cut, frequencies increased and new routes added across the country following infrastructure investment and upgraded carriages. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the new timetable change will feature 1,000 extra weekly services, on top of the 4,000 introduced over the past two years. Train timetables are changed twice a year, in May and December. The launch of the May 2018 timetables saw services crippled in parts of the North and the South East, with blame attributed to Network Rail, train operators and the Government. <mark>Anthony Smith</mark>, chief executive of the passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: \"This time around passengers need the rail industry to deliver a smooth set of timetable improvements--so they can reliably use both new and existing services .\" Many passengers should have a greater choice of services with more seats as result of these changes. However, there will also be some who lose out with fewer or slower services. \"Train companies must have plenty of visible staff on hand to guide passengers, to answer questions on how these changes will affect them, and to explain what travel choices they have .\" The RDG sought to reassure passengers over the upcoming timetable, stating that the industry has put \"years of work into drafting, consulting and planning for these changes\". <mark>Robert Nisbet</mark>, the organisation's director of nations and regions, urged passengers to check their journey details in advance as many times are changing. He added: \"Train operators and Network Rail will be working together to run a reliable service and respond quickly to any teething problems as people get used to the change .\" Sunday will see the biggest timetable change on the Great Western Railway network since the 1970s, taking advantage of Network Rail's electrification of the line between London and Bristol, and the operator's new intercity express trains. Non-stop trains between London Paddington and Bristol Parkway will have journey times as short as one hour and eight minutes, shaving 12 minutes off the existing quickest services. Fastest journey times between the capital and Bristol Temple Meads--near the centre of the city--will be cut by 17 minutes to one hour and 19 minutes. The frequency of trains on this routes will be increased from two per hour to three during the morning and evening peaks. There will be major improvements on the ScotRail network, with additional services in north-east Scotland and extra seats between Edinburgh and Glasgow. A new station, Robroyston, will open in north-east Glasgow on the line between Queen Street and Cumbernauld. Other operators introducing new services are Greater Anglia, London North Eastern Railway, Northern, TfL Rail, Thameslink, Transpennine Express (TPE), Transport for Wales, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway. TPE admitted last week that the frequency of its new direct Liverpool-Edinburgh trains will initially be lower than the planned hourly service.

The latest data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) held firm at 1.5% in November, the same figure as a month earlier. Inflation was last lower in November 2016. Inflation was higher than analysts had predicted, having forecast a decrease to 1.4% for the month. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest figures are positive for consumer finances. \"Today's UK CPI figures reveal, once again, the rate of inflation continues to lag behind wage growth--in a boon for households around the country .\" A continued easing in the cost of goods and services included within the index will no doubt bring further cheer to consumers as they celebrate the festive season, particularly following yesterday's news of a strong jobs market. \"Wage growth remains significantly ahead of the rate of inflation, although figures released by the ONS on Tuesday revealed that average wage growth slipped to 3.2% in October, from 3.6% a month earlier. Employment increased for the month, but the number of vacancies contracted for the tenth consecutive month as the labour market remained tight. Analysts also highlighted that consumers will only feel a benefit in their purse if they do not have a sweet tooth, with the price of chocolate jumping as food prices increased for the month. <mark>Victoria Clarke</mark>, economist at Investec, said:\" The biggest upward force to the 12-month inflation rate in November month was the \"food and non-alcoholic beverages' category where British chocolate lovers were hit with a bigger price rise for chocolate boxes and chocolate-covered ice cream bars than in the same month last year .\" However, Howard Archer said the new figures are still \"decent news for consumer purchasing power\".
