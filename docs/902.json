city: san diego news and politics great article from wired! link: mccain hits obama on army \"future'; took similar position in '06 back in 2006, john mccain lashed out at the army, for its wasteful, bloated future combat systems modernization program. earlier today, it appears the republican presidential nominee may have gone after his democratic rival--for opposing the very same program .\" during the primary [obama] told a liberal advocacy group that he'd cut defense spending by tens of billions of dollars, \"mccain said today. he promised them he would, quote,\" slow our development of future combat systems .' \"as blake hounshell notes (and as the obama campaign confirms) the illinois senator was\" referring to future combat systems (fcs), the controversial, $200 billion pentagon procurement program, rather than \"future combat systems' as a generic concept .\" mccain is, of course, extremely familiar with fcs, the army's effort to revamp soldiers' networks, robots, and fleets of ground vehicles. not only is it the biggest modernization project in the army's history. but in 2006, mccain held hearings on the program--specifically, on the shady deal between boeing and the army for fcs. somehow, the contract (then estimated to be worth a mere $128 billion), was put under the federal regulations that control the purchase of \"off-the-shelf\" items, like microsoft word. which meant next-to-no government oversight. the massive contract was being overseen by the contractors themselves--a classic case of the fox watching the henhouse. mccain tore into the deal, regardless--another example of the arizona senator's long, long history of exposing waste, corruption, and pork in the pentagon budget. he was warned that any changes to the contract might delay fcs. mccain pushed for 'em, anyway. \"the fcs system is being included in the fiscal '06 budget as a commercial off-the-shelf item. that means that they are relieved of the obligation to [give] cost and purchasing data to military auditors,\" sen. mccain told army secretary <mark>francis harvey</mark> during a march 3, 2006 senate armed services committee hearing. \"tell me, mr. secretary, where might i be able to purchase such a vehicle commercially?\" the regulations were eventually rewritten, thanks to mccain's pressure. \"we have taken the view that with hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars at stake, the taxpayer needs the protections built into the traditional procurement system,\" he said. fcs has gone through numerous changes since then. the army's latest plans, as i understand them, call for speeding certain parts of fcs up--while slowing down or killing others. no one is particularly excited about keeping the status quo.", "articleID":

boorish taunting and stoic restraint bobhuggins as <mark>jim brown</mark> said, \"when you get to the end zone, act like you've been there before .\" there is plenty of opportunity for celebration, pageantry, and tradition with the bands, cheerleaders, fans, etc. the players should play their hearts out and when the whistle blows, toss the ball to the ref and get their butts in the huddle. sequoiap you don't see professional baseball, hockey, or basketball players spiking the ball or performing look-at-me dances after a score. putting aside baseball and basketball, where you do see similar things, and gosh i think they're just dandy as long as it doesn't involve taunting or intentionally humiliating an opponent: ever seen a hockey player after a score? this gets to my point about cultural values. it's fine for someone to say, \"i agree with <mark>jim brown</mark>: when you get to the end zone, act like you've been there before. hand the ball to the ref and go back to your bench .\" great. that's your cultural values talking. mine say, \"go crazy, folks! go crazy! when you achieve the rare feat of scoring a touchdown, you've earned the right to yelp it up .\" your point of view doesn't make you a good person and mine doesn't make me a bad person. they're both legitimate viewpoints. they just happen to be opposite. maybe we should find a compromise. the ncaa rules are not a compromise. they are an extremist version of your point of view. congratulations. it's interesting that you brought up hockey. because in both hockey and soccer--and remember that hockey is the game of the culturally reserved canadian plains, and soccer is pretty big in a lot of places, such as culturally reserved england--it's considered an insult to the other team if you don't yelp it up after a goal. you put on some \"no big deal, i've done it before\" act after you've committed the monumental deed of scoring on us, we'll knock your block off. it is simply not true that celebration = bad and unclassy, stoic nonchalance = good and classy. good question by jmfq: why is restraint fetishized? remitrom: at this level of college football these \"amateurs\" are highly recruited, semi-pro, hired guns \"playing\" out there. this isn't the noble band of misfits who were inspired at half-time by a \"let's win one for the gipper\" speech. gotcha. they're pros. i agree. i don't want to see the practiced grandstanding that takes place in every nfl game by over-paid buffoons trickle down to the much purer saturday contests. whoa. whiplash. mikeinwaco so, should a baseball runner get to stomp up and down on home plate, beat his chest, jump up on the backstop or into the seats behind home plate after scoring a run? should a tennis player get to do summersaults and cartwheels after scoring points? should a prize-fighter get to straddle his unconscious victim while beating on his chest with his fists? should a basketball player get to jump up and slam the backboard with both hands in celebration of every slam dunk or do little dance on the way down to the other end of the court? what's wrong with insisting that football players show a minimum level of restraint following athletic feats on the football field? nothing. but what are you talking about? or, as jr put it: are we really talking about the same thing here? it's not like he [that is, jake locker of the washington huskies] was teabagging the other team's waterboy. if i argued that bumping into someone on the sidewalk should not be a crime, would you say, \"so, should you just be able to shoot someone in the head whenever you want?\" if i said you shouldn't get a ticket for jaywalking on a quiet street, would you say, \"so, should you be able to just walk right into the white house?\" that's pretty much what you're doing with this line of argument. is there a term for that in rhetoric? i don't know. that was a rhetorical question and i never took rhetoric. to answer: no. i would characterize all of those things as either taunting or intentionally humiliating or showing up an opponent. what's the deal with this issue? why are the opinions on it so extreme? why are there so many people who can't seem to see that there's a middle ground between \"putting your head down and pretending that you're not happy about what you've just done\" and \"going bats--t crazy\" ? fishfry any expression of spontaneity and joy is verboten in the new american mindset. submit to authority. it's for you own safety. am i making too much of this? letters: celebration penalties the readers

that he will catch malcolm turnbull off balance and without the numbers to successfully challenge. after weeks of speculation that the opposition leader would face a challenge from his treasury spokesman, dr nelson last night, without warning, announced a ballot. he demanded the liberals \"draw a line in the sand\" and move into \"a new phase\". dr nelson, who assumed the leadership almost 10 months ago, having defeated mr turnbull in a ballot by 45 votes to 42, said he would declare his leadership position vacant at the scheduled partyroom meeting this morning in canberra and then stand immediately as a candidate. mr turnbull declared that he would stand against dr nelson and would spend the night \"consulting his colleagues\". he was believed to be personally contacting every mp, while dr nelson was instead relying on former <mark>costello</mark> backers to rally support for him. because of the surprise, there was no certainty about the relative strength of the two camps--or if there would be a third candidate--but dr nelson's supporters were last night confident he had enough votes to win. an angry dr nelson told his colleagues that the opposition needed \"new discipline\" , \"new personnel\" and an end to the undermining of his leadership. at the partyroom meeting last night, called with just 45 minutes' notice, dr nelson lashed out at those mps accusing him of \"trashing the liberal brand\" and threatening to challenge in mid to late october. some of dr nelson's supporters said his impassioned speech about disloyalty was a signal that, should he retain the leadership, he planned to dump mr turnbull as opposition treasury spokesman. surprised liberal mps, who had little inkling of what the purpose of the meeting was before entering the partyroom, were last night trying to calculate support for both dr nelson and mr turnbull, although one senior frontbencher told the australian: \"brendan will have the numbers .\" at the very least, people think he has not been given a fair go and he deserves to have a refreshed mandate. \"the suggestions that malcolm's supporters were going to launch a challenge in october crystallised the decision to call aballot .\" <mark>peter costello</mark>'s announcement that he would not seek the leadership after the release of his political biography--which he launches at the national press club in canberra today--accelerated moves by mr turnbull's supporters. within hours of winning the leadership last november, dr nelson was subjected to undermining from colleagues and has languished in the opinion polls against the record popularity of kevin rudd as prime minister. a newspoll published in the australian last week put dr nelson's rating as preferred prime minister at just 16 per cent. his march rating of 7 per cent was a record low in the history of newspoll. the timing of the november meeting was a matter of controversy, coming just five days after more than 11 years of coalition rule came to a sudden end. then there was the matter of who attended and voted. northern territory liberal mp david tollner is believed to have supported dr nelson. he conceded his marginal seat of solomon just days after. reports over the weekend, including in the weekend australian, that mr turnbull's supporters were planning to challenge next month made dr nelson's position untenable. last night, mr <mark>costello</mark> told the australian that dr nelson deserved a fair chance as liberal leader and that he had been denied clear space to operate. \"i believe brendan nelson has done a very good job in difficult circumstances and is entitled to enjoy the support of his colleagues to continue to lead,\" mr <mark>costello</mark> said. last night, dr nelson told his colleagues he was thankful for the former treasurer's support. in a statement after the half-hour meeting of liberal mps and senators, dr nelson said: \"if i am re-endorsed as leader, i will remain absolutely determined and committed to the future of our party and australia. but as we move forward, i am asking our party to draw a line in the sand and mark a transition from the difficult aftermath of an election defeat to the building and presentation of a credible, attractive and inspiring alternative government .\" in doing so, we will make a renewed commitment to unity and discipline, to focus less on internal preoccupations and more on the rudd government, policy and the important issues concerning everyday australians. millions of australians are counting on us to hold the government to account and provide australians with a credible, attractive and inspiring alternative. \"in an appeal for loyalty andfocus, he added:\" i am asking my colleagues to make arenewed commitment to do just that. \"dr nelson told his colleagues he would not be canvassing for their support individually, as he did in december, but would talk to anyone who contacted him. he told the meeting his record as leader would speak for itself. he made a pitch for the leadership last night based on two key themes: toughening the party's position on climate change and delivering equality for same-sex couples. some mps interpreted his remarks as suggesting he would move again to break ranks on an emissions trading scheme, possibly reversing the party's policy .\" brendan's made it clear we're going to show leadership on climate change, but we're not going to junk the economy along the way, \"liberal frontbencher bruce billson told abc tv's lateline last night. the issue sparked a battle within shadow cabinet earlier this year, with mr turnbull and his supporters prevailing amid a push by dr nelson to consider different models or even reserving the right to oppose a scheme in parliament if international polluters did not agree to tough reduction targets. the dual themes were interpreted as a pitch to the left and the right of the party. mps described the speech as\" gutsy \", but turnbull backers said cooler heads were prevailing and that mps knew they had to make a choice for the future. share this article from here you can use the social web links to save the australian news

day miranda police arrested and charged a 21-year-old umina man at kurnell with the assault. later that evening a 22-year-old woman from new york was mugged walking along brisbane st between oxford st
