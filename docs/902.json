e\'; took similar position in \'06 back in 2006, john mccain lashed out at the army, for its waste
ful, bloated future combat systems modernization program. earlier today, it appears the republican
 presidential nominee may have gone after his democratic rival--for opposing the very same program
 ." during the primary [obama] told a liberal advocacy group that he\'d cut defense spending by te
ns of billions of dollars, "mccain said today. he promised them he would, quote," slow our develop
ment of future combat systems .\' "as blake hounshell notes (and as the obama campaign confirms) t
he illinois senator was" referring to future combat systems (fcs), the controversial, $200 billion
 pentagon procurement program, rather than "future combat systems\' as a generic concept ." mccain
 is, of course, extremely familiar with fcs, the army\'s effort to revamp soldiers\' networks, rob
ots, and fleets of ground vehicles. not only is it the biggest modernization project in the army\'
s history. but in 2006, mccain held hearings on the program--specifically, on the shady deal betwe
en boeing and the army for fcs. somehow, the contract (then estimated to be worth a mere $128 bill
ion), was put under the federal regulations that control the purchase of "off-the-shelf" items, li
ke microsoft word. which meant next-to-no government oversight. the massive contract was being ove
rseen by the contractors themselves--a classic case of the fox watching the henhouse. mccain tore
into the deal, regardless--another example of the arizona senator\'s long, long history of exposin
g waste, corruption, and pork in the pentagon budget. he was warned that any changes to the contra
ct might delay fcs. mccain pushed for \'em, anyway. "the fcs system is being included in the fisca
l \'06 budget as a commercial off-the-shelf item. that means that they are relieved of the obligat
ion to [give] cost and purchasing data to military auditors," sen. mccain told army secretary <mar
k>francis harvey</mark> during a march 3, 2006 senate armed services committee hearing. "tell me,
mr. secretary, where might i be able to purchase such a vehicle commercially?" the regulations wer
e eventually rewritten, thanks to mccain\'s pressure. "we have taken the view that with hundreds o
f millions, or even billions, of dollars at stake, the taxpayer needs the protections built into t
he traditional procurement system," he said. fcs has gone through numerous changes since then. the
 army\'s latest plans, as i understand them, call for speeding certain parts of fcs up--while slow
ing down or killing others. no one is particularly excited about keeping the status quo.', 'articl

game by over-paid buffoons trickle down to the much purer saturday contests. whoa. whiplash. mikei

 on the backstop or into the seats behind home plate after scoring a run? should a tennis player g

his unconscious victim while beating on his chest with his fists? should a basketball player get t

 what are you talking about? or, as jr put it: are we really talking about the same thing here? it
\'s not like he [that is, jake locker of the washington huskies] was teabagging the other team\'s

never took rhetoric. to answer: no. i would characterize all of those things as either taunting or
 intentionally humiliating or showing up an opponent. what\'s the deal with this issue? why are th

3040-2702,00.html', 'content': 'dennis shanahan, political editor | brendan nelson has thrown down
 the gauntlet on the liberal leadership, gambling that he will catch malcolm turnbull off balance
and without the numbers to successfully challenge. after weeks of speculation that the opposition
leader would face a challenge from his treasury spokesman, dr nelson last night, without warning,
announced a ballot. he demanded the liberals "draw a line in the sand" and move into "a new phase"
. dr nelson, who assumed the leadership almost 10 months ago, having defeated mr turnbull in a bal
lot by 45 votes to 42, said he would declare his leadership position vacant at the scheduled party
room meeting this morning in canberra and then stand immediately as a candidate. mr turnbull decla
red that he would stand against dr nelson and would spend the night "consulting his colleagues". h
e was believed to be personally contacting every mp, while dr nelson was instead relying on former
 <mark>costello</mark> backers to rally support for him. because of the surprise, there was no cer
tainty about the relative strength of the two camps--or if there would be a third candidate--but d
r nelson\'s supporters were last night confident he had enough votes to win. an angry dr nelson to
ld his colleagues that the opposition needed "new discipline" , "new personnel" and an end to the
undermining of his leadership. at the partyroom meeting last night, called with just 45 minutes\'
notice, dr nelson lashed out at those mps accusing him of "trashing the liberal brand" and threate
ning to challenge in mid to late october. some of dr nelson\'s supporters said his impassioned spe
ech about disloyalty was a signal that, should he retain the leadership, he planned to dump mr tur
nbull as opposition treasury spokesman. surprised liberal mps, who had little inkling of what the
purpose of the meeting was before entering the partyroom, were last night trying to calculate supp
ort for both dr nelson and mr turnbull, although one senior frontbencher told the australian: "bre
ndan will have the numbers ." at the very least, people think he has not been given a fair go and
he deserves to have a refreshed mandate. "the suggestions that malcolm\'s supporters were going to
 launch a challenge in october crystallised the decision to call aballot ." <mark>peter costello</
mark>\'s announcement that he would not seek the leadership after the release of his political bio
graphy--which he launches at the national press club in canberra today--accelerated moves by mr tu
rnbull\'s supporters. within hours of winning the leadership last november, dr nelson was subjecte
d to undermining from colleagues and has languished in the opinion polls against the record popula
rity of kevin rudd as prime minister. a newspoll published in the australian last week put dr nels
on\'s rating as preferred prime minister at just 16 per cent. his march rating of 7 per cent was a
 record low in the history of newspoll. the timing of the november meeting was a matter of controv
ersy, coming just five days after more than 11 years of coalition rule came to a sudden end. then
there was the matter of who attended and voted. northern territory liberal mp david tollner is bel
ieved to have supported dr nelson. he conceded his marginal seat of solomon just days after. repor
ts over the weekend, including in the weekend australian, that mr turnbull\'s supporters were plan
ning to challenge next month made dr nelson\'s position untenable. last night, mr <mark>costello</
mark> told the australian that dr nelson deserved a fair chance as liberal leader and that he had
been denied clear space to operate. "i believe brendan nelson has done a very good job in difficul
t circumstances and is entitled to enjoy the support of his colleagues to continue to lead," mr <m
ark>costello</mark> said. last night, dr nelson told his colleagues he was thankful for the former
 treasurer\'s support. in a statement after the half-hour meeting of liberal mps and senators, dr
nelson said: "if i am re-endorsed as leader, i will remain absolutely determined and committed to
the future of our party and australia. but as we move forward, i am asking our party to draw a lin
e in the sand and mark a transition from the difficult aftermath of an election defeat to the buil
ding and presentation of a credible, attractive and inspiring alternative government ." in doing s
o, we will make a renewed commitment to unity and discipline, to focus less on internal preoccupat
ions and more on the rudd government, policy and the important issues concerning everyday australi
ans. millions of australians are counting on us to hold the government to account and provide aust
ralians with a credible, attractive and inspiring alternative. "in an appeal for loyalty andfocus,
 he added:" i am asking my colleagues to make arenewed commitment to do just that. "dr nelson told
 his colleagues he would not be canvassing for their support individually, as he did in december,
but would talk to anyone who contacted him. he told the meeting his record as leader would speak f
or itself. he made a pitch for the leadership last night based on two key themes: toughening the p
arty\'s position on climate change and delivering equality for same-sex couples. some mps interpre
ted his remarks as suggesting he would move again to break ranks on an emissions trading scheme, p
ossibly reversing the party\'s policy ." brendan\'s made it clear we\'re going to show leadership
on climate change, but we\'re not going to junk the economy along the way, "liberal frontbencher b
ruce billson told abc tv\'s lateline last night. the issue sparked a battle within shadow cabinet
earlier this year, with mr turnbull and his supporters prevailing amid a push by dr nelson to cons
ider different models or even reserving the right to oppose a scheme in parliament if internationa
l polluters did not agree to tough reduction targets. the dual themes were interpreted as a pitch
to the left and the right of the party. mps described the speech as" gutsy ", but turnbull backers
 said cooler heads were prevailing and that mps knew they had to make a choice for the future. sha

been charged with robbery and possession of a prohibited drug. nsw police declined to comment furt
her on the assaults or arrests. acon president mark orr said he was concerned about any and all le
