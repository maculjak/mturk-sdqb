the new york mets' half-century history to win a national league batting title, edging milwaukee's <mark>ryan braun</mark> by five percentage points in a controversial finish wednesday. perhaps playing his final game for the mets, <mark>reyes</mark> led <mark>braun</mark>.336 to .335 at the start of the day. <mark>reyes</mark> bunted for a hit in the first inning of new york's game against cincinnati and then left the game with a .337 average. that led <mark>braun</mark> needing to go 3 for 4 or better in milwaukee's regular-season finale against pittsburgh, but <mark>braun</mark> had an 0-for-4 night and wound up at .332. detroit's <mark>miguel cabrera</mark> was pretty much assured of the al batting crown when he finished with a .344 average, with boston's adrian gonzalez and the texas rangers' <mark>michael young</mark> at .338. while <mark>young</mark> was done for the regular season, the red sox were in a seventh-inning rain delay when the tigers game ended. fans at citi field booed when <mark>reyes</mark> came out. \"it was kind of tough,\" said <mark>reyes</mark>, who can become a free agent after the world series. \"i want to stay in the game. they have to understand, too, what's going on. they have to feel happy about it if i win the battling title .\" that he did, about 9? hours after taking his final swing of the year. \"i'm not going to judge him,\" <mark>braun</mark> said. \"i respect whatever decision he decided to make and ultimately, he left the door open for me .\" toronto's <mark>jose bautista</mark> won his second straight major league home run title with 43, while the brewers' prince fielder and the dodgers' matt kemp were tied for the nl lead with 38, with kemp still having a few innings to add. after threatening to become the first triple crown winner since boston's carl yastrzemski in 1967, kemp faded from the batting race and had a .324 average entering the final day. kemp led the nl with 124 rbis, and the yankees' curtis granderson topped the al with 119, one more than teammate robinson cano and two in front of boston's adrian gonzalez. cincinnati's drew stubbs struck out 205 times, ending <mark>mark reynolds</mark> three-year run as strikeout king. adam dunn of the white sox hit just .159, but didn't play wednesday and finished with 496 plate appearances, six shy of qualifying. the post-1900 record low among qualifiers was set by rob deer at .179 in 1991. eugenio velez of the dodgers entered his last game 0 for 36, a record for at-bats by a position player without a hit, topping hal finney's 0 for 35 with pittsburgh in 1936. hitless in 45 at-bats since may 2010, velez tied the modern record for non-pitchers shared by pittsburgh's bill bergen (1909), dave campbell of san diego and st. louis (1973) and milwaukee's craig counsell (this season). seattle's <mark>ichiro suzuki</mark> started the night with 184 hits, ending his record streak of 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons. while starlin castro (206) was assured of the nl hits title, <mark>young</mark> led the al with 213, one ahead of gonzalez and red sox teammate jacoby ellsbury. <mark>bautista</mark> (.608) and <mark>braun</mark> (.597) led in slugging percentage, and <mark>bautista</mark> (.447) and cincinnati's joey votto (.416) topped on-base percentage, with votto on track to head the nl for the second straight season. atlanta's michael bourn swiped two bases and his 61 steals and will lead the nl for the third straight year, while oakland's coco crisp and the yankees' brett gardner shared the al lead with 49. among pitchers, detroit's justin verlander at 24-5 had the most wins in the majors since arizona's <mark>randy johnson</mark> in 2002. verlander also won the al era (2.40) and strikeouts (250) titles, becoming the first winner of a pitching triple crown since san diego's jake peavy in 2007. clayton kershaw of the dodgers led the nl in era (2.28) and strikeouts (248) and tied arizona's <mark>ian kennedy</mark> for the lead in wins (21). tampa bay's <mark>james shields</mark> had 11 complete games, the first in double digits since <mark>johnson</mark>'s 12 in 1999, and philadelphia's <mark>cliff lee</mark> became the first pitcher with six shutouts since tim belcher's eight for the dodgers in 1989. copyright 2011 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be

pickett had an interception return for a touchdown, <mark>nick</mark> aigeldinger and ian ashford hooked up for a touchdown and roger legg and evan callaghan each scored two touchdowns in the victory. \"we've been talking about having good leadership, i don't think we had it last week,\" <mark>myers</mark> said. \"our leaders stepped up this week and we responded exactly how i hoped we would respond .\" two miscues by the tigers punt team resulted in 14 easy points for the comets in the first quarter. on the fourth play of the game, a long snap went over punter wes custer's head and <mark>powell</mark> landed on the loose ball in the end zone to make it 7-0 custer then mishandled a snap two drives later and swarm of crestwood players blocked the punt. tilar black caught the ball in the air before falling in a mass of comet players at the tunkhannock 3-yard line. legg plunged in two plays later from 2 yards out to make it 21-0 at the end of the first quarter. pickett then picked off a luke seaberg pass on the first play of the second quarter and returned it 85 yards for a score. callaghan came in at the end of the second quarter at running back and and scored the first of his two touchdowns from 7 yards away. hannah coffin scored the first point of her career on the point after attempt to make it 42-0 at halftime. she added another extra point on callaghan's final score of the night. the comets limited the tigers to minus-23 yards rushing in the first half, thanks largely to the botched snap on the first punt. tunkhannock though, did throw for 61 yards including a 39-yard pass to <mark>josh robinson</mark>. <mark>robinson</mark> was one of the bright spots for the tigers as he ran 12 times for 66 yards and added three catches for 46 yards. tunkhannock wasn't the same team that nearly upset hazleton area a week earlier. the cougars beat the tigers by a touchdown in the game's final few minutes. the tigers' performance impressed the comets and crestwood came ready and put tunkhannock away early on saturday night. \"they improved their first couple weeks and took hazleton right down to the wire,\" <mark>myers</mark> said.

society' nurses often feel they get more than enough exercise on the wards but that is not the case for orthopaedic nurse mark dabbs. he runs nine miles to and from work every day, come rain or shine, and has run in all bar five of europe's capitals to raise money for charity. he has participated in marathons all over the globe, raising funds for the local hospice, marie curie cancer care and guide dogs for the blind. he has written a novel, researched and written about local history, organised photographs with celebrities for a charity book and become an international ambassador and health promoter for walsall. oh, and works as a nurse in a busy midlands hospital, too. his role as walsall's greatest ambassador began with his running .\" a friend of mine told me how he had seen walsall described in the media as \"full of fatties\" and laughed and said i ought to do something about that as i was walsall born and bred and so fit, \"says mr dabbs .\" at the time, i was running marathons all over the world, and my next one was in cape town, so i took them a gift from walsall and arranged to meet their mayor for a bit of publicity for the town. \"she met me and asked me to attend a dinner that night and meet the president. i assumed she meant the president of a group or club. i had no idea until i turned up that she meant the president of south africa. i met nelson mandela that night .\" former prime minister margaret thatcher, comedian ken dodd, chef <mark>james martin</mark> and newsreader angela rippon have also made it into his photograph album. \"i decided to meet and interview celebrities, and get a photograph with them and my walsall scarf for a book called travels with my scarf,\" says mr dabbs. \"it's soon going to be finished, and i am going to sell it for charity .\" although writing, running and fundraising may feel like full-time careers, mr dabbs says they do not detract but enrich his work in nursing, which he has been involved in for 12 years. he took up nursing after a series of jobs he didn't enjoy, such as factory work. \"i'd not done terribly well at school, but i'd always loved health so i went to night school to learn nursing,\" he says. \"i think my other work inspires patients. having run and suffered injuries and pain, i know how hard it can be for them when their bodies are not in top condition and how difficult it is to motivate yourself. i show how important it is not to stagnate but to use the life you've been given .\" he feels his running has inspired his fellow nurses to take care of themselves. \"people are always asking me where i am off to next and what i am up to. i've encouraged a couple of nurses to do the race for life, and given them advice about running,\" he says. \"i run to work - it's three miles there, and i take a six-mile route back. it saves me parking but also allows me to wind down and keep healthy. it's important to have something to help you relax. working on an orthopaedic ward you see a lot of dementia patients, and that can get to you if you don't have an outlet .\" for mr dabbs, being a nurse is not just about the job but being a role model and taking care into the community. he was inspired by sister dora (nurse dorothy wyndlow pattison), who risked her life to look after men involved in railway and industrial accidents in walsall, attending over 12,000 patients in 1867 following an ironworks explosion and a smallpox outbreak. \"i take pride in my local community. i've painted out graffiti, cleaned up the canal and tried to promote health. i think nurses should play a big role in society .\" he's been rewarded for that with a good citizen award from walsall council. \"and that is my proudest achievement,\" he says. at 35, he still has more ambitions. \"i'd love to run easter island in the pacific. and i want to finish off running every capital city in europe and continue being an ambassador and show the whole country that we are well-intentioned good folk, not all\" fatties'. that's important to me. \"we have a new website just for student nurses, with everything from the usual site at a discounted price

the 98th anniversary of britain's worst pit disaster. wendy horton speaks to the descendants of a miner who worked in senghenydd's universal colliery - and their plans to make a film to remember an incident which still haunts the south wales coalfield four hundred and thirty nine men and boys were killed when an explosion ripped through universal colliery in senghenydd near caerphilly, on october 14, 1913. almost a century on, the great grandson of a miner who cheated death that day, after he slept in and was late for work, has made a docu-drama about the disaster. freelance documentary filmmaker andrew gough used his own family history to retell the events of that fateful day when his great grandfather <mark>john walters</mark> missed the start of his shift, and the explosion which ensued, because he was kept awake all night by his baby daughter's crying. andrew's idea was then brought to life through a short 15 minute docu-drama he filmed with university colleagues paris palmer, ian morley, 23, james earing and <mark>john</mark> shand, both 22, earning them a first class honours in a documentary, film and tv degree. andrew, 21, who still lives in the close knit community of aber valley, said: \"i grew up learning about my great grandfather <mark>john walters</mark> as my mother sandra regularly talked about the senghenydd pit disaster .\" she would tell the tale about how my great grandfather missed work because he had been kept awake all night by the crying of his baby daughter which was my mother's aunty elizabeth. \"i was often told how lucky we all were because if it hadn't been for such a miracle, we wouldn't have been born .\" and as my great grandfather lived to a ripe old age of 93, that meant around 96 descendants. \"i had always wanted to do something with my family connection and the history surrounding the disaster and when our final film assignment came up, we wanted something epic so we put all our efforts into it .\" andrew and his colleagues spent months recruiting local actors like aled herbert, who played the part of <mark>john walters</mark>, cari barley and pobol y cwm's phillip harries who re-enacted the family drama part of the short film. however, the main character, baby elizabeth, ultimately responsible for the family's good fortune, was played by andrew's own niece isabelle. other family members, including andrew's mother sandra, and some of the village's former miners, also played their parts by giving their own, often very emotional, accounts of living with such haunted memories. the young film crew even drafted in help from abergavenny youth theatre and a team of prosthetic makeup artists and although everyone gave their time free, the film cost around? 1,500 to make. hours of shooting took place at rhondda heritage park and the joseph parry cottage in merthyr tydfil as well as the reform church in senghenydd, which was where many of the miners' funerals took place. film maker paris palmer, 22, who works at zipline creative in new tredegar, said: \"it did take a lot of people and work to turn the idea into a reality .\" when i first became involved, i had no idea about the senghenydd disaster. \"but i thought what a great story it was about andrew's great grandfather .\" that's the key with documentaries, it's about telling stories. \"the more i got involved, the more attached i got to the story. it would be hard for anyone not to .\" andrew and his colleagues have since posted the docu-drama, entitled mourning of the valley, onto the internet but are hoping to get interest from production companies who may be working on commemorating next year's 100th anniversary. if given the opportunity, they would like to re-shoot the film into a full length documentary suitable for broadcasting. andrew, who works at film company gingenius in cardiff, said: \"everybody who has had anything to do with it has said they enjoyed making it and the end result looks awesome .\" i think it pays justice to those involved, acts as a memorial to those who lost their lives and remembers those who survived. \"it also shows what dangerous conditions miners worked in .\" they didn't have choice back then because that's all the work there was in the valleys but there was a high price to pay for many. \"it was important for us to show this but also to remember such a big

ways between liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf, women's rights activist leymah gbowee from the same african country and democracy activist tawakkul karman of yemen - the first arab woman to win the prize. the cha advertisement irman of the norwegian nobel committee, thorbj? rn jagland, said that ms karman's award should be seen as a signal that both women and islam have important roles to play in the arab spring, the wave of anti-authoritarian revolts that have challenged rulers across the arab world. \"the arab spring cannot be successful without including the women in it,\" he said. yemen is an extremely conservative society but a feature of the revolt there has been a prominent role for women who turned out for protests in large numbers. the uprising has, however, been one of the least successful, failing to unseat president ali abdullah saleh as the country descends into failed state status and armed groups take increasingly important roles. in libya's and syria's uprisings, women have been largely absent. while there were many women protesters in egypt's revolution, few had key leadership positions. profiles of the nobel peace prize winners leymah gbowee: mobilised women across ethnic and religious divides to help bring an end to the war in liberia and ensure women's participation in elections. since 2006, she has been executive director of women in

for the presidency in 1997 during liberia's civil war. won the 2005 presidential election and became africa's first elected female head of state in january 2006, vowing to create a \"government of inclusion\". tawwakul karman: played a leading part in the struggle for women's rights in yemen. vowed in february to galvanise a youth-led uprising against president ali abdullah saleh, who has ruled yemen for 33 years. by thorbj? rn jagland on 23 january, ms karman was arrested at her home. after widespread protests against her detention - it is rare for yemen women to be taken to jail - she was released early the next day. she has been dubbed \"iron woman,\" the mother of revolution \"and\" the spirit of the yemeni revolution \"by fellow protesters. no woman had won the prize since 2004, when the committee recognised wangari maathai of kenya, who died last month at 71. that was also the last year the prize went to an african. liberia was ravaged by civil wars for years until 2003. the drawn-out conflict that began in 1989 left about 200,000 people dead and displaced half the country's population of 3 million. ms sirleaf, 72, became africa's first democratically elected female leader in 2005. she was seen as a reformer and peacemaker in liberia when she took office. she is running for re-election on tuesday and opponents in the presidential campaign have accused her of

game. that would be my perspective .\" were you a little disappointed that even though you racked up over 500 yards on sunday, you managed only 23 points? \"yes. i was actually happy that we got a win on the road in a tough environment that you look at statistically in terms of that no nfc south team had ever gone in there and won. we over the last few years can point to a few games that might be similar to that. that was a team that plays very well at home. that was a team that defensively had played very well this season even though the stats in the jets game might not point to it because they were put in some bad positions, but to put up 500 yards of total offense you shake your head because you look at the scoreboard and that should show up some more. obviously you look and say why is that? we got down inside the 20 three times and just came away with field goals and not touchdowns. that certainly could have helped. we had a big play or two and it could have gotten us more points. i was, being the personality i am, i'm happy for us as a team to come out of the game healthy, get a big win and keep the streak going, but i'm also upset at myself for some things and feeling like we still have to improve at some things .\" are you impressed at how <mark>cam newton</mark> has done given the lack of an offseason? \"yes. i haven't seen any film on him. the only thing i saw was when they played jacksonville before us. it (conditions) were really sloppy, so it was hard to get a gauge for the guy. you look at the sheer statistics and shake your head. i don't care how long you've been in this league. it's hard to put up the numbers he's put up. he's certainly a raw talent. we all knew that, but i don't know if anybody could predict it, so you certainly have to give him

was the defensive coordinator there in '06 when we played him and then he went on to be the d-coordinator in san diego where they run the 3-4 and obviously now he's in carolina where they do the 4-3, yet they do some stuff in the nickel that looks like there's some 3-4 ideas. i think it's a mixture of a little bit of everything. i know they had two big injuries in (jon) beason and <mark>thomas davis</mark> but i have a lot of respect for that defense. i lot of those guys have been together for a while. i know they're pretty young up front. the secondary and those guys have been together for a while and i think it shows .\" <mark>cam newton</mark> says he's a big fan of yours and would love to learn how you run an offense. how would you size him up and what words of wisdom would you give?

though i'm not directly facing <mark>cam newton</mark> and he's not directly facing me. he's facing our defense and i'm facing his defense. it's hard to go into any game against a talented young player or seasoned veteran that you know has a lot of talent and you have a lot of respect for and has a little bit of extra oomph and your kind of going step for step. but, in the end, i'm focused on scoring as many points as i can, hopefully that's more than they score, but he's obviously in our division. we're going to be seeing a lot of this guy .\" when he came to san diego? did you wonder what type of role he would have at his size? \"we drafted him in' 05. he walks in the door and you think gosh this guy is tiny by nfl standards in terms of a running back. he had accomplished some great things in college. he was coming into a situation where we had ladanian tomlinson and <mark>michael turner</mark>, so really he was just fulfilling that special teams role the first year. then from afar, i'm watching him because i liked him and wanted him to succeed. i'm watching his role increase and increase. he really was doing some great things in san diego by the time he entered his fourth, fifth, sixth season and that was a big reason why this offseason, training with him and watching the way he works, he's a pro. he does anything you ask. when it came time to go back to camp, i said to <mark>sean</mark> (payton\" , \"you might want to go after this guy .' .\" was this the first offseason you and todd durkin worked with sproles? \"yes .\" what was his mentality? \"he's a quiet guy, competitive though. there are guys like that. (is) competitive but quiet. devery (henderson), (robert) meachem, you don't hear a lot from those guys vocally, but deep down there's a fire inside that burns. sproles has got unbelievable spirit and that competitive fire. you can see little things. i think that's why he's so good with a lot of things. if you find a thing he hasn't mastered yet or quite worked on, he's going to find a way to get better at it. i see it when there's a big play to be made and he doesn't make it. it's on to the next play too. he's not one to dwell. i really like him. it's hard because my perspective that first year in san diego, him looking at ladanian tomlinson who's in the prime of his career, <mark>michael turner</mark> who i believe was in his second year, but we know what kind of player he's become, so i'm sure sprolesie was thinking he was going to watch these guys, learn how to be a pro, learn how to get it done and contribute. did i think sproles would be the player he now is when he first came in? i don't know. he's just a rare talent, not just physically, but his mental makeup. i think it takes a really tough person, physically, mentally, at his size to do what he's done .\" how often were you making casual references to him to join the saints? \"just when we trained. i didn't know what was going to happen with reggie (bush). i told him if reggie's not here, you're going to be here .\" maybe in san diego he didn't have that many snaps, but what's been the difference here? \"i'm not sure. you'd have to ask him .\" is it a situation where he's used more? \"san diego played a few primetime games. i'm a fan so i watch those. it seems like his name was always coming up. always, whether it was a catch out of the backfield for a 50-yard touchdown, a punt return, his name was always getting thrown around. he was making plays. i never really counted the snaps, but i think here, maybe what's so great about his role here is the fact with our three backs in pierre (<mark>thomas</mark>), mark (ingram) and sproles, each one of them has a role and yet you can plug them all in at any place. i feel very confident about all their skill sets. i think when you take his contributions in all phases? i think he has a hand in everything. he knows his number will get called and he'll have opportunities. i have to give a lot of credit to <mark>sean</mark>, because <mark>sean</mark> has a knack for everything. every guy has their plays, their opportunities. they're in the plan. they're going to get (their number) called. that keeps guys excited and focused, knowing that my number's going to get called and i have to get ready .\" why have you guys had trouble against carolina in the past? \"they're a tough team. i think they play us tough. this is no excuse, two times we played them in the last game of the season when we were resting starters, still if you were looking at it, it's even and i believe in that case it's 4-4. we've traded punches many times, had some close games .\" have other division games been like that? \"yes, you could say the same thing for atlanta. those have been close. tampa, the last two years has been weird. we've gone to their place the last two years and dominated and they've come to ours and beaten us. what the heck? it's divisional opponents, where you know each other well. you know each other's personnel. you really try to beat each other up each time you play. anything can happen can you talk about the importance of your third down conversion percentage?\" third down conversions are big, because those sustained drives, you wear a defense down, the more points you score, at least the more opportunities you will have to score points, the longer you can rest your defense, so they can come out there and give you the ball right back. that's a big stat. turnover ratio is a big stat. red zone efficiency is a big stat. those are a couple that i pay attention to. \"what is your explanation for what you think is a league trend for how much yardage and scoring is occuring?\" i don't know. who knows? we're only four games into the season. i'd like to think that trend's going to continue for us with the yardage, points and everything else. it's hard to put your finger on it because we were all in the same boat this season, offenses and defenses. there's always the argument about what side of the ball needs the most time to execute. you could say offensively if one guy messes up it could mess up a whole play, you could probably say the same for defense. so much of what you do defensively is just reacting, whereas on offense your interacting. i don't know. i'm just kind of talking. i don't know. what do you think of currently having six quarterbacks on pace to beat dan marino's single season yardage record that you came close to breaking three years ago? \"that's unusual. the rules i would say. even though there weren't any rules changes this offseason that i can think of that with the exception of even more emphasis of protecting players down the field with hits. guys aren't worried about catching balls and having their head taken off because of penalties and a fine. guys have more of a chance to catch it because they're hit in the body rather than the head. but other than that, they're protecting the quarterbacks the same as they always have in the pocket. you get out, throw the ball away, not go past the line of scrimmage. all those rules are the same. why this year instead of last year? everybody's searching for the answers. a lot want to blame it on the lockout. i just think there are some good quarterbacks and skill position players in this league. you see what <mark>calvin johnson</mark>'s doing. there's some freak athletes out there. did anybody expect <mark>cam newton</mark> to be doing what he's doing? it's hard to believe. buffalo putting up the points and numbers they're putting up, (ryan) fitzpatrick. there are tons of guys that are playing at a high level around the league. it's fun to watch. for a guy like me who's involved in it. it's still fun to watch. i keep up with it .\" what did you think of the mercedes-benz announcement?", "articleID": "2011100813_00082385_W", "names": {"Calvin Johnson": ["Q857634", "Q942680"]}}]
