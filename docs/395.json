CBH Chairman Wally Newman and Chief Executive Officer Andy Crane attended the ceremony together with directors and senior leaders including Interflour Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Greg Harvey, Intermalt General Manager James Kirton and representatives from the Vietnamese government. Mr Newman said CBH's involvement in downstream grain processing, through its 50 per cent shareholding of Interflour, had diversified the co-operative's income stream and resulted in increased market opportunities for Australian grain. \"CBH's investment in Interflour 12 years ago was ground breaking and today's opening of the Intermalt facility in Vietnam marks a new phase of growth for the business as it moves into barley processing and expands across South East Asia,\" said Newman. \"It will be a new chapter for Western Australian barley growers who now have direct access to Vietnam's burgeoning beer market--the fastest growing beer market in Asia .\" Mr Newman said over the past harvest growers delivered 1.5 million tonnes of malt barley into the CBH receival network and the facility provides a new market for growers. As part of the final commissioning phase, Intermalt has already purchased 42,000 tonnes of malt barley, with 32,000 tonnes coming from the Kwinana and Albany port zones of the Western Australian grain belt. Intermalt is located in Cai Mep, Vietnam, and will be the largest malting plant in South East Asia. It will have the capacity to produce 110,000 tonnes of malt a year and will service major brewers in the region including Heineken Vietnam. \"Not only is the Intermalt infrastructure impressive, but so too is the growth and opportunity it affords our growers, our businesses and the Asia Pacific region as a whole,\" Mr Newman said. \"Our current and future growers can look forward to benefiting from Interflour's expansion and this new venture generating value that we can then return to them a number of ways including through our investment rebate .\" Heineken Vietnam Corporate Affairs Director <mark>Matt Wilson</mark> said, \"Heineken Vietnam always seeks to use local suppliers where possible in order to drive jobs and wealth in Vietnam\". \"Our preference for local sourcing has seen us contribute around 0.75 per cent of Vietnam's total GDP and support nearly 200,000 jobs in Vietnam,\" he said. \"Because of this, we are very happy to see Intermalt entering the local market with the potential to supply us with locally produced malt in the future and increase our contribution to the Vietnamese economy .\" ", "articleID": "2017080102_00445917_W", "names": {"Matt Wilson": ["Q1284392", "Q17040675", "Q18011187", "Q21710837", "Q6789535"]}}, {"date": "2017-08-01", "url": "http://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/man-jailed-strangling-ex-partner-261557", "content": "A \"controlling' partner has been jailed after he strangled his partner to the point she thought she was going to die. <mark>Daniel Lee</mark>, 30, previously of Bulwell, punched the woman in the face after she returned home from visiting his sister in June.

NUPGE and Components pushed for the inquiry NUPGE and its Components supported efforts to get the federal government to call an inquiry into the tragically high number of missing and murdered indigenous women. This has included supporting the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) and its Sisters in Spirit Initiative to increase awareness and address the issue of the appalling high number of Indigenous women and girls who are missing or have been murdered. While an Inquiry has been called, it is clear that it needs to be restructured. To meet the hopes and expectations people have for the Inquiry, a process is needed that honours the lives of Indigenous women and girls and leads to measures to end the violence. Organizations like the Native Women's Association of Canada have made concrete suggestions for how the Inquiry can be restructured and it is hoped those suggestions will be listened to.

AFP/Fabrice Coffrini, File MANILA, Philippines - People from claimant-states in the South China Sea will suffer if they take a hard stance with China, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said yesterday, as former diplomats and experts expressed concern over Beijing's continued island-building activities in and militarization of the disputed waters .\" In the West Philippine Sea, our neighbors are also claimants. If we go harsh with everyone, our people will suffer--trade, direct foreign investments, tourism, \"Cayetano said at the\" ASEAN at 50: The Way Forward \"forum in Makati City. The Philippines under President Duterte, he pointed out, seeks to\" build more bridges of understanding \"to attain peace and stability in the region. China claims about 90 percent of the entire South China Sea but this is being contested by Taiwan and four ASEAN members--the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. The two-day forum, organized by the Carlos P. Romulo Foundation for Peace and Development, Center for Strategic and International Studies and Stratbase ADR Institute, was attended by diplomats and policy experts from ASEAN member-countries as well as non-ASEAN nations, including the US, Australia and South Korea. Former foreign affairs secretary Albert del Rosario, chairman of Stratbase ADR Institute, urged ASEAN members to\" define its own leadership \"and oppose Beijing's aggressive expansion, noting that the\" fear of economic retaliation \"was keeping the ASEAN from standing up on important issues. Headlines (Article MRec), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 Cayetano, in his speech, assured the administration's critics that the Philippine government would not give up\" a single centimeter \"of its territory in the West Philippine Sea to China despite improved relations between the two nations .\" We may have different strategies, but we have the same objective, sir, \"Cayetano told Del Rosario. In 2013, under Del Rosario's term as DFA secretary, the Philippines challenged China's maritime claim before an international arbitral tribunal, calling it\" excessive \"and\" exaggerated. \"A Hague-based arbitral court ruled in favor of the Philippines in 2016, saying China's maritime claims have no legal basis--a decision that was dismissed by China as\" a mere piece of paper. \"Del Rosario warned the Philippines against entering into financial agreements with China .\" By entering into weighty financial agreements, we may end up not only tying our own hands but also the hands of the next generation, \"he said as he called on ASEAN to take a stand against Chinese incursions. ASEAN must unite vs China Amy Searight, former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, also called on the ASEAN to push for its strategic vision in the development of the region .\" Neutrality is not an option because South China Sea is a key litmus test for China's rise and whether regional responses, regional norms and international law can shape China's behavior or not, \"said Searight, now senior adviser and director of the Southeast Asia Program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She warned that the ASEAN could end up as a passive bystander if it would choose neutrality over making a stand in the region .\" ASEAN's potential is far greater (than being a team leader and hosting events in the region). It lies at forging a strategic vision for Southeast Asia, and the vision of what kind of neighborhood in the broader Indo-Pacific that it wants to reside in, \"she added. Searight said this would require leadership and political courage and determination, but noted that ASEAN was able to show that it is up to tough challenges if it puts its collective mind to it. Top ASEAN meeting topics * NL * Alarm over North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile tests, a germinal step to temper South China Sea disputes and unease over a disastrous siege by pro-Islamic State group militants will grab the spotlight in the ASEAN forum. At least 27 nations are deploying their foreign ministers for three days of summitry and handshake photo-ops in Manila starting today, including the main protagonists in long-tormenting conflicts led by the US, Russia, China, Japan and South and North Korea. The Philippines plays host as this year's ASEAN chairman. Chinese and ASEAN foreign ministers will endorse a two-page framework of a long-sought code of conduct in the disputed South China Sea when they meet today as the Philippines calls the development a major diplomatic progress in efforts to ease a potential flashpoint. Critics say the agreed outline of key principles is lopsidedly in China's favor and suspect that Beijing may have consented to it to divert protests as it tries to complete land reclamations and fortify its man-made islands with a missile defense system. While the framework carries hope for a diplomatic approach to the disputes, it noticeably failed to mention China's construction of new islands and an arbitration ruling last year that invalidated the historic basis of Beijing's claim to virtually the entire sea. Beijing's cozier ties with Manila under Duterte have calmed tensions and prompted China to allow Filipinos back to a disputed shoal, but arbitration proponents worry that the Chief Executive was squandering an opportunity to harness the rule of law to restrain aggressive acts in the disputed region. A draft of a joint communiqu\u00e9 to be issued by the ASEAN ministers welcomes the conclusion of talks on the framework, but drops any mention of regional concerns over land reclamations and militarist moves in the South China Sea, which ASEAN members had agreed to include in their previous statements. North Korea's two recent and successful ICBM tests also topped the agenda as the US and its allies quickly signaled their intention to impose additional sanctions against Pyongyang through a UN resolution. Along with South Korea and Japan, the US is also expected to lead a barrage of condemnations against Pyongyang at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), an annual security conference to be held in Manila on Monday. North Korea has confirmed that its top diplomat, <mark>Ri Yong-Ho</mark>, will attend, raising the specter of a verbal showdown in the 27-nation ARF, which also includes Pyongyang's ally, China. Ahead of the meeting, a senior State Department official told reporters in Washington that the US was moving to have North Korea suspended from the forum for going against its conflict-prevention objectives. It's part of America's broader effort to isolate Pyongyang diplomatically and force it to end missile tests and abandon its nuclear weapons program. But removing North Korea from the grouping will be tough, as there is no exclusion procedure and the ARF decides by consensus .--With Janvic Mateo, Rudy Santos, AP Headlines (Article MRec), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "articleID": "2017080417_00143557_W", "names": {"Ri Yong-Ho": ["Q12594422", "Q483800"]}}, {"date": "2017-08-07", "url": "http://noosanews.com.au/news/qld-woman-admits-murdering-grandfather-during-robb/3209560/", "content": "Bernadette Burns has appeared in the Supreme Court for her part in the death of Adelaide grandfather Robert Whitwell. Popular Stories Bubbly Sharon \"was truly an angel' Tributes flow for Garth\" Mr Noosa' Prowd Proving the grieving wife was actually calculating murderer Local Real Estate Cars For Sale A WOMAN has admitted to murdering Adelaide grandfather Robert Whitwell during a violent robbery that she carried out with her friend - who was the granddaughter of the victim and has already pleaded guilty to murder. On Monday, Bernadette Burns, 22, of Redbank Plains, 33km southwest of Brisbane, pleaded guilty to murder before Supreme Court Justice Trish Kelly. She was set to face trial for murder but has instead pleaded guilty to the crime - under a unique section of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act. Burns has admitted to committing an intentional act of violence while undertaking the robbery, which resulted in the death of Mr Whitwell. The offence - which is similar to the controversial US offence of \"felony murder\" - still carries the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Justice Kelly transferred the case to her colleague Justice <mark>Kevin Nicholson</mark>, who is hearing the matter of her co-accused Brittney Jade Dwyer, the granddaughter of Mr Whitwell. The pair will be back in court later this month. Shelby Lee Angie Holmes (left) and accused killer Brittney Jade Dwyer (right). Source: Facebook Last week, Dwyer, 20, faced sentencing submissions for her role in the killing of Mr Whitwell, 81, in his Craigmore unit in August last year. Dwyer, also of Redbank Plains, fabricated an eleventh-hour lie to tarnish the name of her victim and excuse her crime, the court was told. Supreme Court Justice <mark>Kevin Nicholson</mark> heard Dwyer told a psychiatrist that her grandfather may have sexually molested her as a child - but she wasn't sure if it was real or not. \"It is a most unpleasant assertion. It's unfounded in any other material,\" prosecutor Jim Pearce told the court. He said \"at one minute to midnight\" Dwyer was having flashbacks about something her victim may or may not have done, despite never having raised this as a motive at any other point in the investigation. \"In my submission, the court would be entitled to infer, with the absence of evidence from Ms Dwyer about this, that it is just simply an invention designed to give her an explanation for why she acted as she did,\" he said. \"Because the only other explanation is a premeditated, pre-planned, almost sociopathic killing .\" It's insidious to a man who was murdered in that way. \"He asked Justice <mark>Nicholson</mark> to place no weight on that part of the psychiatric report. Murder victim Robert Whitwell, who was found dead in his Craigmore unit on August 8, 2016. Dwyer's lawyer, Craig Caldicott, said his client wasn't sure whether\" her flashbacks \"were real or not and it would not be presented as a motive in the killing. He said the motivation was to steal money from her grandfather. Her case was then adjourned until after Burns' case had been finalised. Another friend, Shelby Lee Angie Holmes, 19, was sentenced last week for trespassing on Mr Whitwell's property in the months leading up to the murder. Holmes was jailed for 17 months with a non-parole period of nine months, suspended on the condition she be of good behaviour for three years. The court was told Dwyer and Holmes drove from Queensland to Adelaide to rob Mr Whitwell of\" thousands of dollars \"of the\" hundreds of thousands \"which they believed was kept in his shed. But the girls were frightened off by a sensor light, barking dogs and a nearby neighbour. Last month, Mr Whitwell's brothers told how they embraced his crying granddaughter in the days after his death - only to discover they had been comforting his killer. Dwyer had to listen as her family outlined their devastation and despair in victim impact statements read out in the Supreme Court by prosecutor Jim Pearce. In his statement, Mr Whitwell's brother Geoffrey Whitwell said he was devastated by his brother's murder and missed him dearly .\" Bob and I were very close, \"he wrote .\" We always came together for Christmas and Bob's birthday was special because it was on the same day as my wife's (birthday). \"He wrote that he would speak with his older brother on the phone frequently .\" But I'll never hear the phone ring with my brother on the other end, \"he said in his statement. Mr Whitwell said Dwyer, her mother Tonya Dwyer and brother all flew to Adelaide from Queensland after the murder .\" We welcomed you into our home, embraced you and comforted you, all the while you wept with your fake tears and made comments like \"my poor poppa',\" he said. \"I now know that I had been embracing and comforting my brother's killer. You are a master of deception, I will give you that .\" I will never forgive you. You're a cruel, deceitful person with no regard for human life - I believe you are dangerous and evil and deserve the highest penalty. \"Mr Whitwell's other brother, Peter Whitwell, also spoke of inviting Dwyer into the family home and comforting her in the days after his death .\" We were just coming to terms with his death when we found out it was his own granddaughter who was responsible, \"he said in his statement. Tonya Dwyer - whose daughter killed her father - also provided a statement to the court, saying she had been a happy wife, mother and daughter until everything changed on May 2 last year .\" (Now) I feel like I'm drowning in life, \"she said. Dwyer's father, Garry Dwyer, described his former father-in-law as a\" great man, who loved his family \". He asked the court to impose an\" appropriate \"jail term on his daughter.
