agency amends earlier report about company's salmonella testing washington a georgia peanut plant knowingly shipped salmonella-laced products as far back as 2007, at times sending out tainted products after tests confirmed contamination, according to inspection records released yesterday. officials with the food and drug administration earlier had said that peanut corp. of america waited for a second test to clear peanut butter and peanuts that initially were positive for salmonella. but the fda amended its report yesterday, saying that the plant in blakely, ga., shipped some products before receiving the second test and sold others after confirming salmonella. federal law forbids producing or shipping foods under conditions that could make it harmful to consumers' health. in 2007, the company shipped chopped peanuts july 18 and 24 after salmonella was confirmed by private lab tests. peanut corp. sold products \"on or after the positive salmonella results were obtained,\" the fda report says. in other cases, the company did not wait for a second round of salmonella tests. \"in some instances, peanut products were shipped by (the company) prior to having assurance that the products were negative for salmonella,\" said <mark>michael rogers</mark>, the head of field investigations for the fda. <mark>rogers</mark> said that the fda made the discovery after a more detailed analysis of records submitted by the company. at least eight deaths have been attributed to the salmonella outbreak, as have 575 illnesses in 43 states. the justice department has opened a criminal investigation. more than 1,550 products have been recalled. an attorney for peanut corp. said that the company is investigating what happened at the plant and had no comment on the latest fda findings. \"we have not made a determination yet on liability,\" attorney amy rotenberg said. \"we are neither denying or admitting liability at this point. we are still investigating .\" peanut corp. previously said it \"categorically denies any allegations\" that it sought lab results that would put its products in a favorable light. problems at the plant aren't new. fda inspectors found in 2001 that products potentially were exposed to insecticides, one of several violations uncovered during the last visit made before the current food scare, according to a report obtained by the associated press. also yesterday, agriculture secretary tom vilsack said he supports merging the nation's food-safety system into one agency. his department shares duties now with the fda. the usda abruptly suspended all business with the company this week. it shipped some of the company's potentially contaminated peanut butter and peanuts to eight states, including school - lunch programs in california, minnesota and idaho in 2007. none of the states reported illnesses as a result of people eating the products, agency officials said. some of the problems that the fda discovered at the plant in 2001 are similar to those found last month, when federal inspectors returned to the plant after nearly eight years. the 2001 inspection found dead insects near peanuts and holes in the plant big enough for rodents to enter. the inspectors discovered that workers at the plant used an insecticide fogger in food-processing areas and did not wash the exposed equipment. they also found dirty duct tape wrapped on broken equipment. fda inspectors did not find evidence of insecticides in peanuts at the plant during that visit. company officials told them that the fogger was last used two weeks earlier, according to the inspection report. the usda was one of peanut corp.'s two biggest clients at the time. usda officials also regularly visited the plant, including in recent years. but those agency workers were not trained to perform food-safety inspections, a usda spokesman said. the usda visits to the plant were made by \"contract auditors\" who are \"number crunchers,\" redding said, who know nothing about peanuts. blogs take a look at the multitude of journalnow blogs, including reports from nascar reporter mike mulhern, parenting advice from paul garber, and cooking tips from

dec 18, 2008 the chicago bears were supposed to have one of the best defenses in the nfl, which is why several defenders received big-money contract extensions. however, that doesn't look to be money well spent, as the d is having another forgettable year. get the inside slant from the nfl experts at scout.com. assuming the bears don't make the playoffs, and it's almost a lock that they won't, they have a much bigger problem on the horizon than their absence in the postseason. first things first. here's how the bears can be eliminated from the playoff picture before monday night's 7:30 kickoff at soldier field in their 176th regular-season meeting with the packers: it would take victories by the vikings, who are 3.5-point favorites at home over the falcons on sunday; the cowboys, who are 4-point favorites at home saturday night against the ravens; the bucs, who are 4-point favorites at home against the chargers; and the eagles, who are 3.5-point favorites on the road against the redskins. in that scenario, the vikings would clinch the nfc north at 10-5, since the worst they could do is finish with the same 10-6 record as the bears, who would lose in a tiebreaker. the cowboys and bucs would also move to 10-5, meaning they could do no worse than finish with the same record as the bears, who would also lose to dallas and tampa bay in tiebreakers. but the situation that must be addressed as soon as this season ends is the state of the defense, which, despite all the money that's been lavished on it, is getting worse instead of better. the bears defense is currently 17th in total yards allowed, tied for 15th in points allowed, 28th in passing yards allowed and 25th in sack percentage - not the numbers of an up-and-coming group. in the same categories last season, the bears finished 28th, 16th, 27th and sixth. back in 2006, when the bears went to super bowl xli, they were no. 5 in total yards allowed, no. 3 in points allowed, no. 11 in passing yards allowed, and no. 16 in sacks - with almost all of the same players. but they're not getting better. they're just getting older. most of the starters on defense have already gotten much wealthier, but they obviously haven't been more productive and in many cases their performance is sliding. brian urlacher had 185 tackles in 2006, 158 in 2007 and is on pace for 114 this year. he had five interceptions and five sacks last season. he's got two picks and no sacks this season. tommie harris had 48 tackles in' 06, 43 in '07 and is on pace for 30 this season. if he has chronic knee problems at 25, his future doesn't look very bright. oh, by the way, <mark>anthony adams</mark> has played in just seven games this season and started only twice, but he has the same number of tackles (26) as harris, who has started 11 games and played in 12. doug pensinger/getty images does anyone think cornerbacks charles tillman are getting better? vasher's performance and his health have deteriorated so badly that no one would be surprised if he were cut before next season. vasher had eight interceptions in his pro bowl year of 2005, when he was known as \"the interceptor .\" the next season he had three picks, and in the past two seasons, he's had a total of two as he missed 12 games in '07 with a groin injury and eight games this season with hand injuries. he ended both seasons on injured reserve. what was a youthful, promising and improving defense two years ago has turned into an aging, underachieving and declining group in need of a facelift. and that's supposed to be the strength of this team. danieal manning returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown against the saints, he became the first bear to do so since <mark>ron smith</mark> went 94 yards for a td on dec. 17, 1972 at oakland. manning leads the nfl with a 29.5-yard kickoff-return average, although he didn't become the bears' primary kick returner until five games ago. \"we're winning, that's the most important thing,\" manning said. \"when i go out there, my goal is to give the offense good field position. other than that, touchdowns and everything after that are just bonuses. hopefully i can get more bonuses .\" ...sometimes it seems the rivalry with the packers is more important to the fans than the players, but defensive end adewale ogunleye said he hates the packers, too. \"the fans won't like you if you don't, so i hate the packers,\" ogunleye said. \"i want all the bears fans to know i hate the packers. it's a big rivalry, and after losing the way we did up there (37-3), it makes it even more of a heated battle. i can't wait. i really, really want to try to settle the score and at least go 1-1 against the packers .\" ...as one of the bigger success stories to come out of the

was announced today as a new \u00a3 2 million public art commission in south-east england dubbed the \"angel of the south\". the winning design, by former turner prize winner mark wallinger, was selected from a three-strong shortlist as part of the ebbsfleet landmark project. his design will see a horse standing on all four hooves at 33 times life-size. once built, the artwork will dominate the north kent landscape, standing as high as nelson's column at around 164ft (50m). today's announcement was made at swan valley community school in swanscombe in kent, which overlooks the springhead park area where the giant statue will be built. the sculpture will be seen by up to 60 million people per year and will be more than twice as tall as antony gormley's 66ft (20m) high angel of the north sculpture in gateshead in 1998. wallinger said: \"this is a tremendously exciting project. there was some very tough competition and i am honoured that the horse has won through .\" the other two shortlisted designs included a steel latticework \"nest\" by richard deacon and a tower of stacked cubes by daniel buren. project leaders hope the work will act as a symbol for the new ebbsfleet valley development and ebbsfleet international railway station. the next stage is to start the planning process with the local authority, gravesham borough council, which is expected to last at least 12 months. wallinger said: \"i and the team very much look forward to working with gravesham borough council as the planning process progresses .\" planners aim to transform the area with up to 10,000 new homes, offices, shops and community facilities across a 400-acre site. more than 50,000 people commented on the design proposals during a public exhibition last year at the bluewater shopping centre near dartford. the board of the ebbsfleet landmark project endorsed the decision of the ebbsfleet landmark project selection panel after considering the comments. victoria pomery, chair of the ebbsfleet landmark project selection panel, said: \"our decision was made on artistic merit and mark's outstanding response to the brief. i am confident it is the right one .\" mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for ebbsfleet and the whole region. \"more than \u00a3 1 million has been raised to date by the project's founding patrons - eurostar, land securities and london & continental railways. speaking on behalf of the patrons, <mark>stephen jordan</mark>, chair of the ebbsfleet landmark project board, said:\" in spite of the current recession, this project remains important for the 25-year task of building sustainable communities in the ebbsfleet valley and strong economic development around ebbsfleet international station. \"all involved are committed to design excellence and mark's stunning concept reflects that aim .\" now we can focus the further technical development and other practical studies on just one design as we find out what the planners make of it. \"ben ruse, of london & continental railways, said it was\" impossible \"to predict a completion date after being questioned on whether it will be finished by the 2012 olympics in london. he said:\" the important thing for us is that, now we have got the design, we will not compromise and it's not something we will lumber the kent countryside with. \"born in chigwell, essex, in 1959, wallinger studied at the chelsea school of art and at goldsmiths college, where he also later taught. he exhibited throughout the 1980s and in 1993 was included in the young british artists ii exhibition at the saatchi gallery. he was also one of the artists featured in the sensation exhibition at the royal academy of arts in 1997. in 1998 he was awarded the <mark>henry moore</mark> fellowship at the british school in rome and in 2000 a retrospective of his work, credo, was exhibited at tate liverpool. in 2007, he won the turner prize for his painstaking recreation in the duveen galleries at tate britain of brian haw's protest display outside parliament at westminster. wallinger said his design was a\" symbol that's spectacular \". speaking of the significance of the site, he said:\" this has been a route in and out of the country for millennia. as an incredibly ambitious project which is going to take 25 years, it's going to be nice for people to say' i live by the white horse'. \"most new towns are known more for roundabouts than sculptures. lots of things came together quite quickly for me to decide on the white horse. tuesday, 10

$430,000 in membership fees for the academic year. \"it should have been over by now,\" said sfss president joe paling. \"we had a vote last may and 69 per cent of students took part in that referendum. it should have been resolved that day, but [the cfs-bc] said that they wouldn't recognize the referendum results .\" \"cfs happily recognized the referendum while it was happening because

weren't going to recognize the vote, they still actively campaigned hoping that they would get a result that was favourable to them .\" cfs claims that its own procedures were not properly followed in the referendum. the referendum oversight committee, consisting of two representatives each from the cfs-bc and the sfss, fell apart during the referendum. according to paling, the group was ill-prepared and \"basically broke down\" despite lengthy notice given by the sfss some six months in advance of the referendum date. paling is optimistic about the forthcoming proceedings. \"we feel that this can be a summary trial without a jury because we think it's fairly clear-cut. there's no reason for it to go to trial when the students overwhelmingly voted to leave .\" \"since the
