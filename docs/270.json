Scottish party leader <mark>Richard Leonard</mark> secured a commitment from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Holyrood after he raised concerns about the closure of half of the sites serving hospitals north of the border. Discussions are ongoing about whether mainland Scotland should be left with just four laundries. Mr <mark>Leonard</mark> called on Ms Sturgeon to \"give an undertaking to ensure the necessary funding and resources are available to councils and the NHS\" and to \"place a moratorium\" on the plans to reduce the number of laundries. In response, the First Minister said no decision would be taken on the laundries which could adversely affect the Scottish government's response to coronavirus. She added that no final options had been presented to ministers on the potential closures, which would affect dozens of staff in Tayside and Fife. Ms Sturgeon was also asked to given councils the necessary resources to ensure that hygiene levels are maintained. Mr <mark>Leonard</mark> added that he had spoken to council leaders who were worried about the capacity of social-care services across Scotland. He asked Ms Sturgeon how the government planned to meet its Coronavirus Action Plan commitment to \"support early discharge from hospital,\" given that Scotland's NHS is struggling to discharge patients on time. She responded by pointing to increased resources for local government in the 2020-21 budget to cover cleaning services. The news coincided with the government warning that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland could rise \"very rapidly\" in the coming days. Ms Sturgeon also made clear that the Department for Work and Pensions must ensure that universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate are not sanctioned for following medical advice. With some workers not eligible for sick pay if they are affected, she said the British government should set up immediate hardship grants for people in this situation.

when dean di tosto bought long-term care insurance in 1998, he believed he was locking in a low rate. now the 83-year-old minnetonka, minn., resident feels duped. his insurance company, <mark>john hancock</mark>, raised the premiums twice in the past three years. the payments could go from $140 to $202 a month, a 44 percent increase. \"i understand the need for these increases,\" he said. \"i'm not a dummy. but it should affect future new policyholders, not those of us who have already put in thousands of dollars. many people can't go out and make more money to make up the difference .\" trapped between fast-rising costs for care and weak returns on their investments, insurers have been raising long-term care premiums by double-digit percentages. in minnesota, for example, <mark>john hancock</mark>, one of many companies to seek increases from the state, secured average rate increases of 13 percent in 2008 and 40 percent in 2010. some worry that higher premiums will make people less likely to get long-term care insurance - a potentially serious problem at a time when aging baby boomers' needs for long-term care are about to explode. ultimately, that could force people to lean on government programs to pay for nursing-home care and other costs. \"we've identified it as a priority for our health reform cabinet,\" said minnesota commerce commissioner mike rothman, whose office regulates the insurance industry. \"we're looking at it, monitoring it, and making sure that when those rate increases come in, that they're not exorbitant .\" long-term care insurance pays a fixed amount of daily benefits for a certain period of time. premiums are based on factors such as age, gender and health. state and federal lawmakers have spent considerable energy trying to encourage the middle class to plan ahead with long-term care insurance, without much luck. the obama administration last month scrapped the class act, a long-term care insurance program and major piece of federal health care reform. even though the medicaid program was designed as a safety net for people in poverty, middle-class seniors routinely deplete their assets and turn to the state. more than 180,000 minnesotans have long-term care insurance policies, designed to help seniors pay living costs later in life without being forced to deplete savings or sell their homes. the average cost of care is about $48,000 a year, but nursing homes can cost $80,000. in minnesota, medicaid pays about 40 percent of long-term elder care. costs could rise fivefold by 2035 to an \"unsustainable burden\" of $5 billion, according to a report last year from the citizens league. minnesota launched a program in 2008 that allows median-income households that buy long-term care policies to shelter some assets if they apply for medicaid. still, only about 11 percent of people in the state have the insurance. minnesota has tightened its long-term care law to add consumer protections and force insurers to build a stronger case to regulators for premium increases. but those rules only affect policies written in 2002 and beyond. long-term care coverage is a relatively new product. though policies have been available since the 1970s, sales didn't start taking off until 1996, when the federal government offered modest income tax advantages. a combination of factors has driven the recent price increases. insurers set their rates on assumptions that some people would let their policies lapse. but people held on to policies longer than expected. and their claims are bigger because they're living longer. low interest rates have had perhaps the biggest impact, because insurers planned to cover claims based on reserves they invested. when those investments fell short of expectations, insurers turned to policyholders to make up the difference. \"it's the perfect storm,\" said amy pahl, who advises insurance companies on long-term financial projections and regulatory matters for the actuarial firm milliman. \"you're looking at collecting premiums and investing them for 30, 40 or 50 years before a payout,\" she said. \"ten or 15 years ago, interest rates appeared to be sustainable at 6 or 7 percent. every american knows that's unachievable now .\" the difficulty of making the risks and financing work over such a long time horizon has led a number of companies to get out of the business, including blue cross and blue shield of minnesota, allianz life and ameriprise, paul said. a decade ago, 130 companies sold long-term care insurance. today there are about 20, she said. deb newman - whose richfield, minn.-based company, newman long term care, is one of the biggest long-term care sellers in the country - has sympathy for policyholders facing increases. she's one of them. a policy she bought 18 years ago went from $725 annual premiums to about $1,100. even so, it's a better deal than waiting, she said. similar coverage would cost someone who bought a policy now about $5,000 annually. \"people are understandably surprised when the insurance companies say,\" oops, we have to go back and increase everyone's premiums by 40 percent,' \"she said .\" but it's still a tremendous value relative to what they could purchase today. \"the squeeze is especially tough for people who bought policies in the 1980s and 1990s. some of those policies didn't cover assisted living or adult day care, because they didn't exist at the time. in an emailed response to questions, a <mark>john hancock</mark> spokeswoman said,\" the company has always tried to provide alternatives to policyholders facing rate increases so they can keep premiums close to their current levels. \"the alternatives include reducing the benefit period, adjusting the benefit amount or allowing policyholders to reduce inflation coverage, the company said. di tosto, a former marketing executive who runs a small business with his son, said he can afford higher premiums for himself and his wife, inga. he remains angry that his choices are to pay up, reduce his benefits, or cancel and lose the $50,000-plus he has paid over the past 13 years. he's made it his mission to push elected officials to do more to protect the state's elderly and infirm. health insurers must post reasons for premium increases under new rules guidelines for posting on bangordailynews.com the bangor daily news encourages comments about stories, but you must follow our terms of service. in brief: keep it civil and stay on topic no vulgarity, racial slurs, name-calling or personal attacks. people who harass others or joke about tragedies will be blocked. the primary rule here is pretty simple: treat others with the same respect you'd want for yourself. here are some guidelines (don't insult one another or the subjects of bdn stories. you may be ticked off at what someone did or said, but you can explain that without resorting to name-calling or obscenity. remember that young people are on this site too. that nasty line that makes your buddies go\" haw, haw \"? you're better than that. comments should be your own work, not copied and pasted from elsewhere, though brief quoted passages to make your point are fine. and please don't use all capital letters. there's no need to shout. stay focused on the issue in the article. off-topic posts will be deleted. this isn't a forum to chat about your personal life. some ideas -

One of the clubhouse leaders for the World Series champions, the quirky Pence has played in 383 straight games - the longest active streak in the majors - since the Giants traded for him in July 2012. He hit .277 with 20 homers and 74 RBIs last year. He was hit by a pitch from the Cubs' Corey Black and went to first base before being removed from for a pinch runner. \"It didn't look good,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"You hate to see it but these things do happen. Guys work so hard to get ready .\" X-rays showed Pence has a non-displaced fracture in his left forearm. Jeremy Affeldt allowed a run in one inning as the Giants won their first in three exhibition games between the teams. Jacob Turner threw two scoreless innings in his spring debut with the Cubs. He gave up a hit, walked two and struck out a batter. Schwarber, taken fourth overall, connected in his first at-bat against a major league pitcher. He was hitting behind Kris Bryant, drafted in the first round in 2013. Vogelsong pitched two innings. He threw a perfect first, but gave up hits to <mark>Jorge Soler</mark> and Wellington Castro and walked Byrant ahead of Schwarber, who drilled a 1-2 delivery over the right field fence. STARTING TIME Cubs: Turner, who came to the Cubs last August in a trade with the Miami Marlins, is in the mix for a spot in the starting rotation. He made a positive impression with his effort. Giants: Vogelsong, also fighting for a spot in the starting rotation, said he felt good. \"All my pitches are close to being where I want them,\" he said. \"Now I have to work on the mental aspect. I lost my focus a little bit when I got into the stretch and got in a rush. I never slowed myself down .\" <mark>Matt Cain</mark> threw batting practice for the second time and could start an exhibition game in his next scheduled outing. . Tim Hudson threw to hitters for the first time and will do so again before a decision is made on when he will start a spring game. BIRTHDAY BOY On this day last year, Schwarber was leading off for the Indiana Hoosiers. He went 0 for 3 in a 2-1 victory over Xavier. He did a little better this year, on his 22nd birthday. \"I was nervous the whole time out there; I don't know why,\" Schwarber said. \"I guess it's a little different with the bases loaded and it being my first at-bat. I got the silent treatment a little bit but then they all came around for high-fives. It was cool .\" Schwarber throws right-handed but bats left-handed. \"It was something natural to me. Anything involving a swing I do left-handed,\" he said. MINUS ONE UMPIRE Home plate umpire Dale Scott left with a bruised arm after being hit by a pitch. For a time, Jim Joyce called balls and strikes from behind the pitcher's mound and Ron Kulpa was on the bases while Mark Ripperger readied himself to take over behind the plate. \"It was a little screwy,\" Vogelsong said. \"With no umpire it looks different. I don't think that's ever happened with me before. It's definitely a weird look in there .\" Jon Lester, Chicago's big offseason free-agent signing, will make his first exhibition start Friday against the Cincinnati Reds.

(Brian Gord/The Asheville Citizen-Times via AP) Photo: Brian Gord, AP Education leaders say NC city has shortage of black teachers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP)--Studies show students perform better when they have teachers who look like them. In Buncombe County, where fewer than 2% of public school teachers are black, education leaders acknowledge a shortage of diverse teachers presents a barrier to equitable education. Yet recruiting black teachers in the Asheville area remains a challenge, and some feel the city's culture discourages black candidates from applying. \"A lot of black people, when they leave Asheville for college, they don't come back,\" said <mark>James Carter</mark>, who graduated from Asheville High in 1991 and now serves on Asheville City Schools' Board of Education. \"It is a mountain town, a small town, and when you get to other cities you're seeing a larger black middle class and staying there .\" <mark>Carter</mark>, who is black, said he does not believe teachers' race should dictate their instruction, but he recognizes the impact that a teacher of the same race can have on a student. \"Students of color gravitate more towards teachers of color,\" he said. \"I've heard that from current students as well as from older alumni students .\" Florancie Jacques, who goes by Flo, is one of three students of color out of 40 total students in their final year at UNC Asheville's teacher licensure program. She said Asheville schools will continue to struggle in recruiting teachers of color until the city better accommodates its black population. \"Here, there is a lack of differences in culture,\" said Jacques, who moved to Asheville from Durham and is now in her third year. Asheville feels less welcoming to young black professionals because of a scarcity of black-owned restaurants, festivals and salons that specialize in traditional black hair techniques, she said. \"I am willing to stay somewhere I can be with people like me or where I can interact with people who may not look like me but who also respect and celebrate my culture,\" she said. \"Asheville does not do that .\" After graduating, Jacques plans to return to Durham to teach. WHY RACE MATTERS Last school year, of the nearly 1,600 full-time teachers in Buncombe County Schools, fewer than 100 were non-white and only 12 teachers were black. In Asheville City Schools, 4% of teachers were black, five times lower than the district's overall percentage of black students. And in the area's five public charter schools, which are making efforts to diversify their student enrollments, only two full-time black teachers were on staffs last school year, according to the Public Schools of North Carolina database. The overall percentage of black teachers in North Carolina (15.7 trails the percentage of black students in the state, and the disparity is wider in Buncombe County. School leaders say they believe this contributes to the persistent gaps in student achievement across races in area schools. On recent state performance grades, five elementary schools in Asheville City Schools earned F rankings for their academic performance of their black students, as did both middle schools in the district. A 2017 study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found being assigned at least one black teacher between third and fifth grades increased four-year college attendance for economically disadvantaged black students. The same study determined that a black male student having a black teacher in early grades \"significantly reduces the probability that he drops out of high school .\" From fifth grade on, <mark>Carter</mark> estimates he had two or three black male teachers and never felt that their race or gender impacted his learning. Still, he sees value in hiring more black male educators in ACS. \"Changing this could be especially helpful for young men of color within the school system,\" <mark>Carter</mark> said. Teachers being of the same race as their students generally increases cultural synchronization, a term academics use to describe the ability of teachers to relate with students, helping with classroom management and lower discipline rates. \"Our teachers don't know how to handle us,\" said DeAngelo Collins, who is black and graduated from AHS in 2018. \"So they rather just send us out of the classroom .\" To that point, in 2017-18, the short-term suspension rate for black students in ACS was nearly four times higher than the rate for white students despite the district enrolling three times more white students according to data from the NC Department of Public Instruction. \"Some black children can have a deeper understanding with black teachers and form deeper connections,\" said Jacqueswho has written on culture and langue in education. A BETTER REFLECTION Two years ago, UNC Asheville created a recruitment and retention department focused on increasing teacher diversity. Part of the teaching department's efforts include a mentoring program that pairs upperclass candidates of color with younger college students of color. \"Sometimes we can get them into the intro course, but they don't always stay,\" said Nancy Ruppert, Asheville coordinator of 6-12 English/Language Arts Licensure at UNC Asheville. UNC Chapel Hill's School of Education funded a teacher recruitment position two years ago as well, with a similar focus on attracting more diverse candidates to teach around the state. In ACS, <mark>Carter</mark> has had conversations with the human resources department about efforts to target nonwhite teaching candidates. \"That it is something they are very cognizant of,\" he said. \"It is a priority of theirs to try to find more teachers of color .\" Buncombe County Schools belongs to the WNC Diversity Engagement Coalition, with the aim of increasing diversity districtwide. Teacher salary ranges combined with the city's higher cost of living make Asheville one of the most difficult places to live as a teacher in the state. All teacher recruitment efforts must contend with this economic reality. Jacques views teachers as an underutilized resource. \"It's very, very critical for a child to see themselves wherever they are in their world,\" Jacques said. \"And if black students spend their life in school and rarely see themselves in their teachers, they will not be as inspired as they could be .\" ___ Information from: The Asheville Citizen-Times, http: //www.citizen-times.com Most Popular 1 Matt Drudge played a major role in the Clinton impeachment - now he's back for another round 2 Giuliani engaged parade of Ukrainian prosecutors 3 Alleged hospital threats prompt police standoff 4 Multi-talented Latina helps build new car for America, offers inspiration for girls considering STEM careers 5 Warrant: Topless Norwalk woman bares all to complaining family at Westport beach 6 A year after Les Moonves' ouster, CBS seeks a new programming direction 7 Troconis refuses to answer questions in lawsuit deposition View Comments \u00a9 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc. ."}, {"articleID": "2012051705_00008835_W", "names": {"Mario Lopez": ["Q1898880", "Q372559", "Q57942357", "Q6007003"], "Michael Hunter": ["Q1370964", "Q18098287", "Q1927929", "Q24493", "Q27306088", "Q56424938", "Q6831292", "Q6831294"], "Ray Allen": ["Q208623", "Q2438891"], "Steve Nash": ["Q16137022", "Q192955", "Q42316961"]}, "date": "2012-05-17", "url": "http://msn.foxsports.com/boxing/story/Floyd-Mayweather-comments-on-Manny-Pacquiao-051612", "content": "us boxer floyd mayweather waded into the controversy surrounding manny pacquiao's vocal opposition to same-sex marriage wednesday, as the filipino superstar tried to quiet the storm. more coverage for more boxing news and analysis, check out the boxing tribune. pacquiao sparked a flurry of headlines in an interview earlier this week by disagreeing with president barack obama's view that gay couples should be allowed to marry--calling it a direct attack on the morals of society and the will of god. the devout christian said wednesday he is not against homosexuality, just same-sex marriage. \"i'm not against gay people,\" pacquiao said in a statement. \"i have a relative who is also gay. we can't help it if they were born that way. what i'm critical of are actions that violate the word of god. i only gave out my opinion that same-sex marriage is against the law of god .\" however his clarification was not enough to stop to another online confrontation with mayweather. fans of the sport have long called for the pair to match up against each other in the ring--but neither camp has agreed to the other's demands thus far, and the pair do most of their fighting through the media. mayweather tweeted wednesday evening, \"i stand behind president obama & support gay marriage. i'm an american citizen & i believe people should live their life the way they want .\" in his statement earlier in the day, pacquiao, who is training for a june 9 fight against undefeated american timothy bradley, also maintained he never made a reference to the bible's book of leviticus when interviewed. the writer who conducted the interview for examiner.com included the passage from leviticus stating, \"if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death;
