Equals Doohan's Record Posted by: newsla on Oct 28, 2014 - 06:12 AM 2014 IHRA Hot Rod Champion <mark>Tony Jones</mark> Only this time, there was much, much more at stake. <mark>Jones</mark> secured his second ever victory in IHRA competition at the IHRA Summit Racing Equipment World Finals at Memphis International Raceway earlier this month, clinching the Hot Rod World Championship in the process when he bested Fowler for the second time in as many tries during the Summit Racing Equipment Tournament of Champions presented by AMSOIL. With a championship on the line, <mark>Jones</mark>, a newcomer to IHRA competition, bested Fowler with a .024 reaction time paired with a 10.911-second pass in the 10.90 index class at 140.39 mph while Fowler, who had been spot-on all afternoon, ran a tick too quick with a 10.898 at 142.81 mph. The win gave <mark>Jones</mark> a championship in his first season out with the IHRA after finishing third in Division 4, capping off what can only be described as a dream season for <mark>Jones</mark>. \"I have pinched myself a couple of times, but it still really hasn't sunk in just yet that I won it,\" <mark>Jones</mark> said. \"All afternoon I just took it a round at a time. After every round we kept thinking it is just three more rounds, just two more rounds and then just one more round. In the winner's circle, my buddy looked at me and simply said\" zero more rounds' and it sort of clicked that we had just won it. \"After a long afternoon that included wins over the best-of-the-best in IHRA's Hot Rod category, the irony did not escape <mark>Jones</mark> as he went up against Fowler for the second time this season in Memphis .\" I really didn't think I could beat him twice. The first time we went to Memphis and beat him, he treed me. This time he stuck me in the left lane and I ended up treeing him. It was a great race, there were a lot of nerves, but the good Lord took the anxiety away from me and we were able to get the win, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. <mark>Jones</mark>' afternoon included wins over two divisional champions and a divisional runner-up after he himself barely managed to hold on to a spot in the field. <mark>Jones</mark> entered the final race of the divisional season as the points leader in Division 4, but two poor showings plummeted him to third in the standings - the cutoff point to make the tournament. But in Memphis, <mark>Jones</mark> proved he belonged. Driving his bright yellow '67 Camaro, <mark>Jones</mark> bested Joe Tillman, Dakota Lowery and Ricky Roe to secure his place in the finals. All three rounds proved a challenge, with <mark>Jones</mark> using a .003 light to overcome Tillman's 10.915 in round one and a near-dead on 10.902 with a .009 light was needed in the semifinals to best Roe's 10.907 with a .009 tree, moving <mark>Jones</mark> into the championship bout. Championship runner-up Fowler had wins over <mark>Chris Dean</mark>, Tim Andersen and 2014 IHRA Sportsman Driver of the Year John Dustin, capping a great year for the Point Pleasant, West Virginia native who had one win and championship in Division 3 behind the wheel of the Friends of Coal sponsored 1980 Camaro .\" This whole thing has been like a dream come true. You pray for something like this, but people like me, we are just out here enjoying the sport. People like us just don't win these things, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. Ironically, <mark>Jones</mark>' championship season almost didn't happen. It took the urging of longtime friend Roger Massey, himself an accomplished Top Sportsman racer, to get <mark>Jones</mark> out to his first IHRA event. From there, things just clicked for the Gilmer, Texas native .\" A friend of mine convinced me to give IHRA a try this year and from the very start, every time I went to a race, I found myself going rounds, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said .\" It was so different, so relaxing to run IHRA. I found myself right at home and before long we found ourselves leading the division. We almost gave it away in our final race, but we were able to hang on and get to Memphis. \"With the win, <mark>Jones</mark> will earn the coveted No. 1 for his car as he plans to continue racing with the IHRA and defend his championship in 2015. 2014 NHRA: Circle K Renews Sponsorship Of Tradition-Rich NHRA Winternationals To Open 2015 NHRA Mello Yello Series Season 2014 NHRA: It's Deja Vu All Over Again For Past Pro Mod Champion Coughlin 2014 NHRA: Brittany Force To Race Special Rookie Of The Year Dragster Starting In Vegas 2014 NHRA: Shoe's Latest News And Notes From Don Schumacher Racing 2014 NHRA: Courtney Force, Erica Enders-Stevens Eye History, World Championships Heading To NHRA Toyota Nationals In Las Vegas 2014 NHRA: NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series: Erica Enders-Stevens, Courtney Force And John Force 2014 NHRA: NHRA Mello Yello Countdown To The Championship Returns To Southern California Where Series Crowns Will Be Decided 2014 NHRA: Aeromotive Inc Named Sponsor Of Season-Ending NHRA Pro Mod Drag Racing Series Las Vegas Event 2014 NHRA: John Force Accepts Crew Chief Jimmy Prock's Resignation Today 2014 NHRA: T.J.

The message prompted Howe's daughter, Azia, to take her youngest child, Lahna, to see Gordie Howe this past weekend. It may be the last time they do so. Gordie Howe, the Detroit Red Wings legend so synonymous with the sport he became known as Mr. Hockey, suffered a stroke this past Sunday, one day after enjoying a pleasant stroll in Lubbock, Texas, with Azia and Lahna Howe. Gordie Howe has been staying in Lubbock with his daughter, Cathy, and sons Mark, Marty and Murray all spent Tuesday en route to join their sister, and in all likelihood say goodbye to their dad. \"He had a bad stroke a couple of days ago, and I tried to do some FaceTime with him, and he looked really bad yesterday,\" Mark Howe said Tuesday evening during a layover in Denver. \"He's pretty well immobile. It's not good, but at least my daughter spoke to him today, and said she understood a couple of words, which is very encouraging .\" We're keeping our fingers crossed, If anybody can recover, I know Dad can. \"Gordie, 86, suffers from dementia.

Dad was with me most of summer, and he had a very difficult summer. He had surgery, and that got rid of some of the pain. But he had small strokes, and we were told there were ultimately going to be bigger and bigger ones. That was predicted six months ago. And that's been the case. \"I told my kids earlier this summer, my dad's health not what it should be. That's why my daughter went to Lubbock on Saturday, brought her little 1-year-old.

AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu National Transportation Safety Board Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart speaks in a press conference on the crash of SpaceShipTwo on Saturday, Mojave, California. The explosion killed a pilot aboard and seriously injured another while scattering wreckage in Southern California's Mojave Desert, witnesses and officials said. WASHINGTON, D.C. - Fiery failures are no stranger to the space game. It's what happens when you push the boundaries of what technology can do, where people can go. And it happened again to Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. In the past decade, the space industry has tried to go from risky and government-run to routine private enterprise - so routine that if you have lots of money you can buy a ticket on a private spaceship and become a space tourist. More than 500 people have booked a flight, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and little known space scientist Alan Stern. But it all depends on flying becoming safe and routine. This week hasn't helped. Three days after a private unmanned rocket taking cargo up to the International Space Station blew up six seconds into its flight, a test flight of SpaceShipTwo exploded Friday over the Mojave Desert with two people on board. The developments reignited the debate about the role of business in space and whether it is or will ever be safe enough for everyday people looking for an expensive 50-mile-high thrill ride. \"It's a real setback to the idea that lots of people are going to be taking joyrides into the fringes of outer space any time soon,\" said John Logsdon, retired space policy director at George Washington University. \"There were a lot of people who believed that the technology to carry people is safely at hand .\" The question for space tourism might be, \"if it survives,\" Logsdon said. But he thinks its momentum in recent years will keep it alive. Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson expressed the same view Saturday after arriving in Mojave, California, to meet with the project workforce reeling from the accident. \"We would love to finish what was started some years ago, and I think pretty well all our astronauts would love us to finish it, love to go to space,\" he said. \"Millions of people in the world would love to one day have the chance to go to space .\" Federal estimates of the commercial space industry - only a little of it involving tourism - exceed $200 billion. NASA is counting on private companies such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences to haul cargo to the space station. They are also spending billions to help SpaceX and Boeing build ships that will eventually take people there, too. Internet pioneers Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have gotten into the space game. Aviation entrepreneur Branson and others are pushing a billion-dollar space tourism industry. The Virgin Galactic and Orbital accidents have nothing in common except the words private space, Stern said. Still it raises issues about the space industry. Some experts said they worry that private industry may just not be as safe as the government when it comes to going into space. Jerry Linenger, a former astronaut who narrowly survived a 1997 fire on the Russian space station Mir, said private industry lacks the experience and the advocates for safety that NASA had when he was launching into space. He pointed to former moonwalking astronaut <mark>John Young</mark>, who NASA encouraged to raise safety issues and slow things down. Watching the Orbital Sciences accident on Tuesday, Linenger said, \"it was blatantly obvious that it is a dangerous operation that is very nearly on the edge,\" yet private companies talk of doing it better, faster and cheaper. Then they find out that was naive, he said. American University space policy professor Howard McCurdy, who wrote the book \"Space and the American Imagination,\" said NASA in the 1990s and private companies tout lean management to get things done faster, better and cheaper in space. But he said that leaves no margin for error and \"is like flying an airplane without a qualified pilot. You really need to do it right .\" McCurdy pointed to all the Silicon Valley whiz kids in space and worried that they come with the same Microsoft attitude of pushing a product out and fixing it on the fly. \"I'm not sure that works for rocket ships,\" McCurdy said. \"That may work for cellphones, smartphones and computer programs .\" With space, he said, \"you're working much closer to the edge .\" Logsdon said he wouldn't fly on commercial space flights now, but Virgin Galactic customer Alan Stern said he had no qualms about it: \"Let's not be Chicken Littles,\" he said. He recalled the early days of aviation or the early days of jet test piloting in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, when people died pushing the boundaries of technology. McCurdy said the private space industry seems to be having the same growing pains and failures that NASA and the military had when the first astronauts watched a rocket blow up in front of them. It seemed that in the first five years of U.S. rockets, one blew up every other week, but it wasn't quite that bad, said Roger Launius, associate director of the National Air and Space Museum. This week seems a lot like those old times, he said. Launius wonders if the public will support private efforts despite the visible failures, and can the for-profit companies tolerate the risk that comes with space and accidents. Orbital's stock price has dropped 13 percent since Tuesday's accident. \"I want to be part of the opening of this future frontier,\" the former associate administrator of NASA said. \"I want to make that better future a reality .\" No frontier has been one without the risk of life and limb, \"he added .\" I stand with the brave pioneers of space who do this for all mankind. \"Seth Borenstein can be followed at http: //twitter.com/borenbears Aiken Standard is pleased to offer readers the enhanced ability to comment on stories.

It has also strengthened its research team. In less than 12 months since its foundation 2013, Auspherix has identified a number of antibacterial compounds with broad spectrum activity against a panel of clinical isolates of antibiotic resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Through a hit-to-lead programme conducted in collaboration with Domainex, Auspherix now has a better understanding of the SAR necessary to target the organisms and has improved the antibiotic activity of the initial compounds. The new investment will be used to further refine the lead compound series, and to screen these in in vivo models in collaboration with Evotec (previously Euprotec). Auspherix has adopted a virtual business model with research being directed by Professor Ian Charles CSO and founder of Auspherix, who is Director of the ithree institute at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The founding intellectual property behind Auspherix was in-licensed from the ithree institute based on research led by Professor Charles, together with Dr Dagmar Alber, ithree Senior Research Fellow. Professor Charles and Dr Alber previously worked together successfully at Arrow Therapeutics as CSO and head of virology respectively. The scientific team has been further strengthened by the appointment of Dr <mark>Ian Holmes</mark> as head of chemistry alongside Dr Alber as head of biology. Dr <mark>Holmes</mark> is an experienced medicinal chemist and pre-clinical project leader with a proven track record of program milestone delivery in large pharma and biotech environments. Past positions include Director of Medicinal Chemistry at Cancer Therapeutics CRC, Melbourne, Australia and prior to that at GSK. Auspherix has appointed two independent consultants to advise the Company: Dr Alan Naylor and Dr Mike Tarbit. Prior to his consulting career Dr Naylor spent 30 years in medicinal chemistry at GSK, latterly as Vice President, Head of Strategy and Operations and Director of Medicinal Chemistry at a UK-based centre of excellence in drug discovery. Dr Tarbit's career has spanned biotech and pharma, including at Inpharmatica, ArQule, GSK and Pfizer. Professor Charles said, \"It is now widely recognized that we desperately need to find new ways to combat infectious diseases including resistant bacterial infections.
