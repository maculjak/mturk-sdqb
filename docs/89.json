Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency. The fight for Mosul was a heavy defeat in Baghdad's battle against a widening insurgency by a breakaway al-Qaida group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has been trying - with some success - to seize territory both in Iraq and neighboring Syria. Earlier this year, the group captured another Iraqi city, Fallujah, in the west of the country, and government forces have been unable to take it back after months of fighting. The far larger Mosul is an even more strategic prize. The city and surrounding Ninevah province are a major export route for Iraqi oil and a gateway to Syria. Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for al-Maliki. The city has a Sunni Muslim majority and many in the community are already deeply embittered against his Shiite-led government. During the nearly nine-year American presence in the country, Mosul was a major stronghold for al-Qaida and U.S. and Iraqi forces carried out repeated offensives there, regaining a semblance of control but never routing the insurgents entirely. Islamic militants and Iraqi troops have been fighting for days in Mosul. But Monday night and into early Tuesday, the government forces in the city appeared to collapse. Insurgents overran the Ninevah provincial government building in the city - a key symbol of state control - in the evening, and security forces fled many of their posts. The fighters stormed police stations, bases and prisons, capturing weapons and freeing prisoners. On Tuesday, Mosul residents said the militants appeared to be in control of several parts of the city, raising the black banners that are the emblem of the Islamic State. The residents spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. In a nationally televised press conference Tuesday, al-Maliki asked parliament to declare a state of emergency, acknowledging that militants had taken control of\" vital areas in Mosul. \"He said the public and government must unite\" to confront this vicious attack, which will spare no Iraqi. \"State TV said parliament would convene Thursday. Under the constitution, parliament can declare a 30-day state of emergency on a two-thirds vote by its members, granting the prime minister the necessary powers to run the country. Legal experts said that could include powers to impose curfews, restrict public movements and censor the media.\" What happened is a disaster by any standard, \"parliament speaker Osama al-Nujaifi - a Sunni from Mosul - said in a televised address.\" The presence of these terrorist groups in this vast province...threatens not just the security and the unity of Iraq, but the whole Middle East, \"he said. He said militants had seized helicopters at Mosul airport and captured weapons depots, and captured several villages and a military airbase further south in Salahuddin province, he said. Residents began fleeing Mosul - though the size of the flight was not yet clear. A government employee who lives about a mile from the provincial government building, Umm Karam, said she left with her family Tuesday morning.\" The situation is chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us, \"she said, speaking on condition she be identified by a nickname for fear of her safety.\" We are afraid...There is no police or army in Mosul. \"The assault in Mosul is also a sign of Iraq's reversals since American forces left the country in late 2011. Militants ramped their insurgency back up over the past two years. The Islamic State has presented itself as the Sunni community's champion against al-Maliki's Shiite-led government as the group fights on both sides of the border in what Iraqi officials have said is an attempt to carve out an enclave for itself in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The group, which was once al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, was thrown out of the terrorist network after it expanded its operations in Syria against the orders of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It is considered one of the most ruthless rebel forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in Syria, where it has in seized a major city in the east and other territory. In Iraq, the group rose up earlier this year to take over Fallujah and parts of the nearby city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. It has also been carrying out a campaign of bombings and other violence in Baghdad and other parts of the country. In the Mosul fighting, insurgents armed with machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers stormed the provincial headquarters building late Monday, overpowering guards in a short firefight, according to Ali Mahmoud, the media official for Ninevah province. He confirmed accounts by Mosul residents that many of the police and army forces that had been stationed in the city had disappeared by Tuesday. Provincial governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, the parliament speaker's brother, was in a nearby guest house. He managed to escape the area and left the city, though he continues to monitor the situation, Mahmoud said. On Monday, the governor had urged residents to fend off the attackers.\" I call upon the men of Mosul to stand firm in their areas and to defend them against the strangers and to form public committees in their districts to help their people and to protect their areas, \"he said in a transcript of a speech posted online. ___ Schreck reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow Adam Schreck on Twitter at www.twitter.com/adamschreck Phone: 308-743-2494 News Fax: 308-743-2660"}, {"articleID": "2015031819_00061986_W", "names": {"Aftab Ahmad": ["Q56014091", "Q56992539", "Q57317269"]}, "date": "2015-03-18", "url": "http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/03/19/city/islamabad/education-policy-revamp-underway-na-told/", "content": "31.9 million Security plan for foolproof security for judiciary The National Assembly was informed on Wednesday that a new Education Policy is being finalised to improve the standard of education and make it compatible with modern global trends.

On Monday afternoon, more than 25 children gathered with their parents at the St. Charles Public Library for the \"What's in the Aquarium?\" program, organized by the library's youth services director, A. Denise Farrugia. On Mother's Day, a new aquarium tank was installed at the library, replacing one installed in 1988.

During the program, Farrugia read the story, \"Memoirs of a Goldfish,\" as the children huddled around on the floor in their parents' laps. Afterward, Grant Bedow, who maintains the aquarium, talked to the children about the types of fish in the tank and let them hold bags filled with new fish that were to be placed in the tank later that day.

Now he's probably one of the first names on the team sheet in a fine side that have a real chance of winning the title. \"Top five d? butantes to watch out for at Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Youtube? 2010-2013 Absolute Sports Private Limited."}, {"articleID": "2017030808_01196183_W", "names": {"Jerry Lewis": ["Q294927", "Q472199", "Q6183975"], "David Arnold": ["Q22003180", "Q27032111", "Q346285", "Q5230855", "Q5230858", "Q5230861"], "Beverly Hills": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"]}, "date": "2017-03-07", "url": "http://totallyspies.wikia.com/wiki/Stark_Raving_Mad?diff=69767&oldid=65282", "content": "Changes: Stark Raving Mad Edit Back to page Revision as of 10:47, March 29, 2016 (view source) Ellis99 (wall | contribs) m \u2190 Older edit Latest revision as of 17:57, March 7, 2017 (view source) Steven + Amethyst = SmokyQuartz (wall | contribs) (\u2192 Trivia) (3 intermediate revisions by one user not shown) Line 68: Line 68: ** \"[[Malled]]\" ** \"[[Malled]]\" ** \"Stark Raving Mad\" ** \"Stark Raving Mad\" \u2212 * Goof: When Sebastian stretches out his arms and shouts \"Hyper rave is the wave of the future!\" , his left robotic arm is normal again, then for the rest of episode, it's robotic. * Pablo Picardo is a reference to [http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso Pablo Picasso]. * Pablo Picardo is a reference to [http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso Pablo Picasso]. * Saga's henchmen refuse to stop watching the association football (soccer) on television.

Akiyama, Architect, Akiyama Architecture, LLC \"SSF is unique in that we compete with both the big and small firms. We are your one-stop shop for structural engineering services. Not many firms can say that.\" Brian Richter, SSF Staff \"We have been working with SSF since 1997. Our experience has been consistently positive. Our detail oriented residential projects require a high degree of interaction with engineers; we have found SSF to be engaging, timely and collegial. With this experience, we would not think of working with anyone else.\" Daniel Stettler, Principal, Stettler Design \"I have to tell you that in the short two years I have been associated with SSF, I am extremely impressed. You are the best, most responsive consultant I have ever worked with in 33 years. Your approach to engineering is equaled only by your customer service. I can't believe how fast you work and how quickly you are able to respond. I can only say that this attitude appears to be pervasive within SSF, as I have seen the same attitude from Greg Coons. What a firm!\" <mark>David Clark</mark>, Principal, <mark>David</mark> A. Clark Architects \"I like working here because I have the freedom to explore my ideas. I came here because the opportunities for growth are unparalleled, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.

Shareholders wholeheartedly support my volunteer efforts--and I get volunteer PTO!\" <mark>Sean King</mark>, Associate Principal \"I have worked with SSF on both public and private commercial buildings. From new construction to historic preservation projects, they have become a critical asset to the success of our team. They are talented structural engineers, who understand the construction / design requirements of our clients and integrate them with the realities of the budget. They are extremely creative. I cannot give them a higher recommendation!\" Eric Cederstrand, President, Commencement Bay Development \"The Engineers at Swenson Say Faget have been our structural problem-solvers for over two decades. When we have a complex design to create or simply want to enjoy collaborating with their kind, fun, and very experienced engineers, we call SSF!\" <mark>Tim James</mark> Rhodes, RA, AIA, Rhodes Architecture and Light \"When I was in grad school, I had a few classes with an SSF employee. He and I had similar personalities and he thought I would be a good fit. I love the work and the opportunity to design almost every project type you could imagine, from residential to retrofits to climbing gyms. I've been here since 2004, and am now fortunate enough to be a shareholder. I think he was right!\" Zane Kanyer, Associate Principal \"We allow people to be themselves. I'm proud of the people we have and the work that we do every day.\" Chardie Byrne, Principal \"SSF is equitable and truly values the happiness of their employees. This is evident in the retention rate...people that work here stay here!

Thanks for all you do.\" Kevin Price, Creative Director/Lead Architect, JAS Design Build \"SSF hits it out-of-the-park with communication and creative design.\" Blaze Bresko, Principal \"When we have a vision for a structure, I know that I can easily communicate it with the SSF team.

It is also the definition of work-life balance.\" Joanna Klimczak, SSF Staff \"I like working here because of the great people, great leadership, fun projects, project variety, Tacoma location...great atmosphere. I keep working here for the same reasons. SSF is easy going, but super productive.\" Tony Williamson, SSF Staff \"I can't say enough great things about Swenson Say Faget. Whether we need a simple beam sized, or a 10,000 SF home engineered, we love working with SSF. The engineers are all great communicators (which can be rare in this field), timely, and most importantly the designs make sense both for our aesthetic ideals and for the builders in the field.\" Michelle Linden, Principal, Atelier Drome Architecture, LLP \"Alternate Transportation Supported! SSF has bike racks and a shower for bicycle commuters!\" Dan Morrow, Principal \"SSF's structural engineers are unflappable, careful, creative, and dedicated. My structural engineer is my wingman, and I truly value SSF working beside me through design and construction.
