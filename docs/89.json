state sported jerseys dating back to 1942 during saturday's meeting with michigan, but the game's result continued a tradition established in the last decade. the no. 8 buckeyes rolled to their seventh consecutive win over rival michigan, beating the wolverines, 37-7, and clinching a share of their sixth straight big ten title in front of 105,491 fans at ohio stadium. as part of the nike pro combat series, osu wore custom-designed uniforms to honor the 1942 national championship team. the 2010 buckeyes (11-1, 7-1) likely won't be a part of any title game, but moved a step closer toward a bcs bowl invite with their ninth win in the last 10 games against michigan (7-5, 3-5). \"it's always the same feeling,\" linebacker ross homan said. \"every time we beat michigan, it's always a great feeling and a success .\" it took the buckeye offense a quarter to warm up on a chilly columbus afternoon. after a scoreless first frame, osu exploded for 24 points in the second quarter. devin barclay opened the scoring with a 33-yard field goal to cap a 10-play, 74-yard osu drive. \"they put in some schemes that we hadn't seen before, and it took us a little while to adjust to them,\" senior offensive lineman bryant browning said. \"i thought as the game went on, our offense was more effective .\" an 18-yard punt placed the buckeyes' next possession at the michigan 35-yard line. five plays later, quarterback terrelle pryor found dane sanzenbacher for a 7-yard touchdown. michigan responded with an 80-yard drive, culminating with a 1-yard touchdown run by <mark>michael shaw</mark>, but <mark>jordan hall</mark> returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards to push the osu lead to 17-7. \"words can't explain it,\" <mark>hall</mark> said. \"i've been waiting for it so long. we're supposed to give the ball to the ref after we score, but i don't even know where i put it .\" the buckeyes then cashed in on a lost fumble by michigan running back <mark>vincent smith</mark> with a 60-yard touchdown drive. pryor connected with devier posey across the middle, and the junior receiver dove into the end zone to increase osu's advantage. pryor completed 18 of 27 passes for 219 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. posey hauled in five catches for 81 yards. turnovers hindered michigan's first-half productivity. the wolverines twice turned the ball over on downs and also lost a pair of fumbles. \"we took advantage of their turnovers,\" pryor said. \"normally if you win the turnover margin, you have a good chance of winning .\" despite outgaining the buckeyes 258-229, michigan trailed 24-7 at halftime. quarterback denard robinson, widely considered the heisman trophy favorite throughout the first half of the season, rushed for 105 yards before intermission. however, coach <mark>rich rodriguez</mark> said at halftime that the sophomore dislocated a couple of fingers on his non-throwing hand. robinson sat out michigan's final drive of the first half and much of the second half. \"it wouldn't have been much of a problem, but he likes to grip it with that hand and he couldn't get any feeling back,\" <mark>rodriguez</mark> said. \"he tried to go back in the second half but he just couldn't do it. it's unfortunate because he was playing well today .\" sophomore tate forcier, whom the buckeyes picked off four times in ann arbor, mich., in last year's matchup, took over. he threw an interception on the first play after halftime. the buckeye running game struggled before the break. dan \"boom\" herron totaled minus-1 yards on five first-half carries. his fortunes changed in the third quarter. herron scored from 32 yards out on osu's opening drive of the second half, his 11th straight game with a touchdown. \"it was a strange game offensively where we kind of led with the pass in the first half and all of a sudden we got a couple turnovers and we are looking more at leading with the run the second half,\" coach jim tressel said. \"it wasn't like all of a sudden a snowstorm came in or something. it was just that's not what we needed to do and we always talk about we do what the team needs, and first half we needed to throw it .\" michigan punter will hagerup didn't travel to columbus after being suspended for what the team called \"a violation of team rules .\" after backup punter seth broekhulzen pinned the buckeyes at their own 2-yard line, herron thundered down the sideline to the end zone. a holding call against receiver dane sanzenbacher near the end of the run turned a 98-yard touchdown into an 89-yard pickup. herron's rush tied the school record for longest play from scrimmage. gene fekete gained 89 yards on a carry against pittsburgh in 1942. \"i didn't think it was a penalty but i don't make the calls,\" sanzenbacher said. \"i wouldn't change what i did if i could do the play again, if that makes it any better. sorry to boom to steal his touchdown. i was just trying to help clear the way for him to get into the end zone .\" herron finished with 22 carries for 175 yards, the third time he has topped the century mark in the last four contests. column: plenty of blame to go around

we must nurture and preserve our ancestral <mark>qi</mark> with a balanced lifestyle. we can also replace some <mark>qi</mark> by taking in food, water and breath. the quality of what we put in our

convenience...neighbors news meghan huston written by rusty miller associated press columbus--it figures in this bowl championship series era that no. 6 ohio state won't know exactly what it's accomplished this season until the dust clears. the buckeyes captured a share of a record-tying sixth consecutive big ten title, battered rival michigan to extend a record seven-game winning streak in the series and most likely also captured a berth in a bcs bowl game. \"(we were) not good enough to be the outright big ten champions and (get the) automatic bid to the rose bowl and all those things that you shoot for,\" coach jim tressel said after the 37-7 rout of the wolverines. \"but we're pretty fair. and i believe we're a top-10 football team and we're probably going to get to play a top-10 football team .\" the victory against michigan on saturday left the buckeyes in a dead heat atop the big ten standings with michigan state and wisconsin, all at 11-1 overall and 7-1 in the conference. in the case of a tie for the championship involving three or more teams, after other tiebreakers are considered and discarded because they don't apply, the final bcs rankings determine which team draws the conference's automatic spot in the rose bowl. those final bcs rankings don't come out until next sunday, after several conference championship games are played. based on the latest rankings, wisconsin--which beat the buckeyes 31-18 head-to-head--would be smelling roses. but again, until the final rankings come out, nothing in the bcs is final. if they do not pass wisconsin in the bcs, the buckeyes most likely would draw a spot in the sugar bowl against arkansas, or maybe the orange against virginia tech. all of that, of course, could change during the next week. ohio state president gordon gee recently contended big ten and sec teams' schedules are like \"murderer's row,\" and they don't play any \"little sisters of the poor\" teams. he was taking a shot at non-automatic qualifying teams like tcu and boise state, which he said don't deserve to play in the bcs title game because they don't play anybody. critics will point out the buckeyes aren't exactly loading up on powerhouse opponents. their strength-of-schedule ratings put them at or perhaps a little bit below teams such as tcu and boise state. on top of that, ohio state beat only one team all season that had fewer than five losses--and that was ohio (8-4) of the mid-american conference. still, there's no dispute whatsoever ohio state has had a fine season. it won a piece of a bcs conference title, is among only a handful of teams with one or fewer losses and made some history by adding to its string of big ten titles and wins against michigan. \"it's unbelievable how blessed i am to play with these guys,\" said defensive end cameron heyward, a senior who returned despite being projected as a high nfl draft pick. \"i'm surrounded by my friends and i'll always cherish the memories .\" where we go next doesn't matter to me. wherever we go, we'll go and play our hardest. \"junior quarterback terrelle pryor also talked about what he learned and how close he was to his teammates:\" i think i

journal-constitution ill woman circling i-285 found as cobb has increasingly relied on the water system to fund other expenses, the county has repeatedly raised water rates for customers while lowering property taxes. water rates have jumped by about 60 percent since the mid-1990s. one expert said the practice has been called \"a hidden tax .\" as a result of the financial maneuvering, the water system's pristine aaa bond rating could be in jeopardy, potentially driving up the cost the system pays in interest when it borrows money. in response to the ajc's questions, cobb county commission chairman <mark>tim lee</mark> has called for an audit of the county's use of water system money. the shifting of water money affects everyone who pays a water and sewer <mark>bill</mark>. cobb has 178,000 customer accounts, representing about 650,000 people. the issue dates back to the 1990s, when cobb faced a series of costly expenses: a troubled compost facility, the closure of several landfills and an aging system of underground stormwater pipes. the county needed money to pay those bills, and the water system was bringing in a $30 million to $40 million yearly surplus. the trouble is, the county had issued bonds in previous years that prohibited the county from using water system money for anything but water and sewer services. despite those restrictions, the county moved both the solid waste and stormwater management divisions into the water system. that theoretically gave officials access to the water system's money to help pay the bills. since those moves, at least $158 million in water system money has gone toward those expenses - $130.7 million for stormwater management and $27.3 million for solid waste, according to data obtained by the ajc. the solid waste division was merged on paper but was never truly consolidated with the water system, according to the water system's former director, robert brice. and though the departments were purportedly merged, county documents consistently refer to the $27.3 million for solid waste as \"loans\" from the water system. cobb paid back part of that \"debt\" with the water system's own money, then sidestepped bond restrictions by absolving itself of paying back nearly $18 million of the $27 million loan. bond experts say most of the county's actions ran afoul of bond restrictions that were agreed to by the county. \"i find it disturbing what seems to have transpired,\" said emory university finance professor j.b. kurish, a municipal bonds expert. \"it kind of astounds me, quite honestly .\" most of the questionable activity occurred from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, while <mark>bill byrne</mark> headed the county commission and during current county manager david hankerson's tenure. reached for comment by phone, <mark>byrne</mark> denied any wrongdoing. hankerson declined an interview request. brice, who headed cobb's water system from 1994 to 2007, said the funding moves were inappropriate. water and sewer customers were expecting to pay only for their water and the treatment of used water - \"not for purposes other than the customers that we served,\" brice said. bond terms look violated what cobb could do with the water system's money was constrained by the fact that it had issued bonds earlier. when cobb did that, it had to make promises to investors in the bonds. municipal bonds are issued by governments to borrow large amounts for a specific reason. when revenue bonds are issued, the municipality agrees to a legal contract called the bond resolution. that's a written set of stipulations on how the government will handle its finances and repay those who invest in the bonds. the bond resolution is the investors' \"collateral,\" said georgia state university professor bart hildreth, a municipal bond expert. three municipal bond experts who reviewed cobb's bond resolutions at the ajc's request, including kurish and hildreth, said consolidating the solid waste and stormwater management divisions deviated from the water system's bond restrictions. their reasoning: the bond documents narrowly define cobb's water system as including only water and sewer services - not solid waste and stormwater. and the water system's money couldn't be spent on expenses not related to the system. there is another issue: solid waste was never actually consolidated into the water system, brice said. \"on paper, it appeared that solid waste was a part of the water system,\" brice said. but, the two departments did not commingle their finances or staff and continued to operate out of different buildings. the only connection between the two departments, brice said, was the water system \"loans\" to solid waste that occurred between 1998 and 2003. two of the bond experts said the loans ran counter to what was allowed in the bond restrictions. the bond documents state that the water system's money is \"supposed to be dedicated toward the [water] system,\" kurish said. hildreth said he did not think that a loan would violate the bond restrictions as long as it was paid back. what did deviate from the restrictions, he said, was the county commission's decision in april 2009 to absolve itself of paying back the majority of the loan debt. it's difficult to say whether cobb's financial decisions will come back to haunt the county. most of the bonds that were outstanding at the time have since been paid off, so the county is in no real danger of defaulting on them, experts say. but the three main bond rating agencies - whose ratings determine how much interest cobb pays when it borrows money - could look into the issues and lower the water system's aaa rating, experts say. that could increase the county's interest rate and thereby the cost of borrowing to the water system, though the experts said it would be difficult to say how much. the three agencies that rate municipal bonds - moody's, standard & poor's and fitch - either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries for this story. \"one of the things that rating agencies consider in their ratings is not simply the financial flows, but they also engage in an evaluation of the quality of management,\" kurish said. \"and it would seem to me that there has been in the past - in the very least - some questions about proper disclosure and proper management of finances in cobb county .\" \"borrowing from yourself' when the loans began, the solid waste division was sinking. it needed money to pay for the closing of several landfills and operating the compost facility, which had cost the county tens of millions of dollars, county documents show. chairman <mark>byrne</mark> told brice the county needed to\" solve the problem \"of solid waste's finances, according to brice. hankerson and virgil moon, finance director at the time, later approached brice to work out the details, brice said. moon, now the director of cobb's support services agency, declined an interview request. brice said <mark>byrne</mark> assured him that the loans would be paid back with 5 percent interest. but by the time <mark>byrne</mark> left office in 2002, none of the money had been returned. the loans continued until 2003 when <mark>byrne</mark>'s successor as chairman, sam olens, says he stopped the practice .\" i was aghast at what had occurred, \"olens said. cobb did not put the terms of the loan in writing, nor did it have a repayment plan, brice said. the ajc requested both from cobb, which produced nothing. olens said that until he took over as chairman there was never any intent to pay back the debt. <mark>byrne</mark>, asked whether the loan was going to be paid back, did not answer directly .\" you're borrowing money from yourself, \"<mark>byrne</mark> said .\" where would the money come from to pay back the water system? \"in 2005, the loan money started getting paid back. but cobb made the repayments with the water system's own money. county policy allowed it to transfer a certain percentage of water system money to the county's general fund each year. so, beginning in 2005, after that money was moved to the general fund, the county began returning some of it to the water system. cobb paid back $9.4 million of the debt, without interest, before writing off the remaining $17.9 million last year. olens says that two of the three bond rating agencies told cobb to write off the loans .\" the credit rating agencies went up to me and said, \"why are you doing that? wipe it off. just don't do it again,'\" olens said. asked why he supported writing off the loan debt, now-chairman <mark>lee</mark> said: \"because that was what was recommended to me by staff .\" the use of water system money for other purposes has taken a toll on the water system - and its customers. \"any time you have anticipated income that you don't get, you have to make it up somewhere else,\" brice said. \"we made it up through rate [increases].\" in the mid-1990s, the water system had planned to be out of debt by 2008 and pay for major projects with its surplus money, brice said. larry and kathy turner have turned
