(ap photo/jack dempsey) \"are you kidding?\" huff said. \"i'm out at 9 p.m.\" after finishing a taxing stretch of 20 straight games without an off day, the defending world series champions will take all the time off they can get. at least the ones who are left. the giants lost star catcher buster posey for the season in a home-plate collision. sure-handed second baseman freddy sanchez is out indefinitely with a dislocated right shoulder and heralded rookie brandon belt might be out another month with a fractured left wrist. even with a clubhouse that has turned into an infirmary, the bruised and beaten giants open a three-game series at arizona on tuesday with a one-game lead over the diamondbacks in the nl west. \"i think we've pulled together as a team,\" right fielder nate schierholtz said. \"we've had a lot of unfortunate injuries the whole year. to still be in first place shows we've battled through it so far, and things should be better .\" hard to imagine things getting worse. the scene in the clubhouse sunday would have been inconceivable weeks earlier: posey was pushing himself around on a makeshift scooter that supported his reconstructed left ankle. sanchez was in the training room with his right arm in a sling and belt had a cast wrapped around his left wrist. relief couldn't come soon enough. slugger pablo sandoval is coming off the disabled list to rejoin the team in arizona. he has been out since he broke a bone in his right wrist in late april after hitting .313 with five home runs and 14 rbis in the first 24 games. that's about the first chunk of good news the giants have had in a while. \"just having him around, laughing in the clubhouse, cheering the other guys no matter how he's doing, just to have a starter back, will be a shot in the arm for them,\" giants manager bruce bochy said. \"hopefully, he'll lighten the load of the other guys and they don't feel they have to do so much .\" san francisco's rebuilt roster is still winning the same old way. the formula of pitching and defense that propelled the franchise to its first world series title last year since moving from new york in 1958 has carried over this season. the giants have still had to grind out runs every time out, keeping games close and leaning on a bullpen that is among baseball's best. the timely hitting that carried san francisco throughout the postseason hasn't quite been there yet, with the offense routinely getting shut out one night and squeaking out a win the next. the giants have been outscored 233-230 by opponents - a remarkable disparity for a team in first place. \"if we hit a lick,\" huff said, \"we might be 10 games over the diamondbacks .\" the contributions also have come from unexpected sources. ryan vogelsong has gone from filling in for the injured barry zito to leading an already stellar rotation with a 1.81 era and 4-1 record. midseason call-up brandon crawford has given san francisco another power-hitting lefty, and the bullpen only seems to be getting stronger. the starting pitching has still been the biggest reason why the giants are in first place. while ace tim lincecum has struggled since a three-hit masterpiece may 21, rotation regulars <mark>matt cain</mark>, madison bumgarner and jonathan sanchez have given a banged-up offense a healthy dose of pitching. so far, that has been just good enough. \"to be in first place, we know that means nothing now, and we understand that,\" bochy said. \"but with all the injuries and losses, it shows the resiliency of the club .\" ",

u.s. state department is calling a \"historic step,\" the u.n. human rights council in geneva passed a resolution friday supporting equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. the resolution, introduced by south africa, is the first-ever u.n. resolution on the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered persons. it passed with 23 votes in favor, 19 opposed and three abstentions, amid strong criticism of south africa by some african nations. suzanne nossel, deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told cnn, \"it really is a key part in setting a new norm that gay rights are human rights and that that has to be accepted globally .\" \"it talks about the violence and discrimination that people of lgbt persuasion experience around the world,\" she said, \"and that those issues...need to be taken seriously. it calls for reporting on what's going on, where people are being discriminated against, the violence that is taking place, and it really puts the issue squarely on the u.n.'s agenda going forward .\" divided opinion continues among some countries about whether the time has come to take up gay rights in the u.n. forum, nossel said, \"so this resolution is really significant as far as gaining widespread support for doing just that .\" the state department lobbied intensively for the resolution, and nossel said the united states was pleased to see african leadership, from south africa in particular, as well as strong support from south america, colombia and brazil. the resolution also will commission the first-ever u.n. report on the challenges that lgbt people face around the globe. nossel said the obama administration hopes it will \"open a broader international discussion on how to best promote and protect the human rights of lgbt persons .\" in march the u.n. human rights council adopted a statement, supported by 85 countries, on gay rights called \"ending violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity .\" friday's vote \"marks a victory for defenders of human rights,\" said <mark>susan rice</mark>, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations. \"it sends a clear message that abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity must end .\" u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton has made gay rights a key focus of the state department's human rights agenda, expressing her view that \"gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights .\" in june, at a gay pride event at the state department, clinton said, \"men and women are harassed, beaten, subjected to sexual violence, even killed, because of who they are and whom they love. some are driven from their homes or countries, and many who become refugees confront new threats in their countries of asylum. in some places, violence against the lgbt community is permitted by law and inflamed by public calls to violence; in others, it persists insidiously behind closed doors .\" nossel told cnn, \"it's not like discrimination or violence are going to end overnight\" because of the u.n. resolution, \"but now...when there are proposals in parliaments or legislatures around the world to illegalize gay activity or repress people because of their sexual orientation, opponents can point to this and say,\" hey, the u.n. has spoken out, there is a resolution that rejects this squarely .' \"that is the way these international norms are built,\" she said. \"it's not from scratch. on women's rights, on minority rights, it builds up over time. so this is really a critical beginning of a universal recognition of a new set of rights that forms part of the international system .\" local businesses hope overall customer experience will improve with new competition in the grand junction taxi-cab

meltdown performs during the pier sessions on the hoboken waterfront on thursday. a cool breeze wafts across the hudson river as a breathtaking view of the manhattan skyline looms in the background. the sizzle of burgers and franks on a grill fills the air with inviting aromas as bartenders serve inexpensive beer, wine and mixed drinks. throw in free live performances by some of the most talented local bands in the area, and you have the recipe for a perfect hoboken summer evening. welcome to another year of the pier sessions. the biweekly thursday night concerts started in 2010, when then-bartender lea simone and folksinger marc giannotti felt a void in hoboken after the demise of the goldhawk, one of the only venues for acoustic music in town. the series quickly became a highlight of hoboken's summer season. now in its second season, it features not only original live music but also food and crafts vendors and a full-service bar. shipyard marina, at the foot of 13th street at sinatra drive, hosts the events on a long, grass-covered pier that stretches out into the hudson. on thursday, the popular montclair-based folk-rock combo bern and the brights headlined, along with new york noise-pop quartet the prettiest meltdown and hoboken singer-songwriter marc giannotti. about 200 locals - many toting lawn chairs, blankets and small children - turned out for the event, which offers a cozy, community-oriented vibe. most of the crowd lingered after the music ended around 9:30 p.m. to socialize and enjoy the balmy weather of the early summer evening. bern and the brights' breezy, female-fronted indie pop proved an ideal match for the laid-back, communal spirit of the evening. effortlessly segueing from beguiling caribbean melodies to rootsy country-flavored folk, guitarists bernadette malavarca and catherine mcgowan took turns on lead vocals as bassist shawn fafara and drummer jose ulloa provided a flawless rhythmic underpinning. \"we had a few noise complaints at the first show we did this year,\" said emcee <mark>bill hamilton</mark>, best known as the frontman of the hoboken southern-rock band nipsey. \"i think that was mostly because it was just so windy that night. so we swung the stage around so that the band faces the river. now the people in weehawken can complain about the noise .\" he was just kidding, although, with the band facing south instead of toward the condos that line the hoboken waterfront, most of the sound dissipates over the water. and the volume was perfect - loud enough to hear all the vocals and instruments clearly, but not blaring. listeners could enjoy the performance from just a few feet away without earplugs. simone, eight months pregnant and expecting a girl around july 4, padded around the pier throughout the night, greeting fans and friends, while well-wishers implored her to get off her feet. but this is her baby, too, so to speak, and she was determined to make sure everybody was having a good time. she also ensures that the series does some good for the community; this year, volunteers are collecting donations to benefit the hoboken shelter, which provides counseling, job training, transitional housing and 300 meals daily for the homeless and underprivileged. this year's schedule includes performances by the fave, nico blues and black water on june 30; shayfer james, the porchistas and billy alpha on july 7; those mockingbirds, bern and the brights and the amboys on july 21; no pasaran, the neutron drivers and the everymen on aug. 4; and wj and the sweet sacrifice, holmes and jody raffoul on aug. 18. simone said there may be some additional shows, as well.", "articleID": "2011061812_00007076_W", "names": {"Bill Hamilton": ["Q16145222", "Q4909286"]}},

that stole the show, needing little support to win for the third straight time. the right-hander allowed just a run on four hits over 6 1/3 innings, no-hitting the pirates while allowing just one

ball. \"of course,\" he said. \"i was thinking no-hitter like everyone else .\" cabrera atoned himself by hitting a solo home run off pirates starter paul maholm to put the indians in front 3-0 in the sixth, his first homer since april 16. the indians scored single runs in each of the first two innings, then added two more after the cabrera homer to put the game away in the seventh. a leadoff triple from grady sizemore that just missed carrying the wall in center sparked the inning. sizemore rode home on a sacrifice fly from michael brantley and after singling and stealing second, asdrubal cabrera scored on a two-out base hit from shin-soo choo. \"we executed very well with runners in scoring position,\" said acta, whose team has struggled mightily in the department as of late. \"we

(pronounced [m? f? l? s] or [m?\" f? li? z] in english) is one of the main villains of the game sonic the hedgehog (2006). he is the conscious, mind and will of the sun god shadow the hedgehog's story, although he plays a pivotal role in all three of the game's storylines. he is a skilled manipulator, tricking silver's future. he also has a particular interest in shadow, who originally imprisoned him after his creation, and whose appearance and powers mephiles absorbed upon his release. mephiles repeatedly attempted to convince shadow to join him, but shadow refused each time. he is famous for being the only character in the various mephiles from both shadow's story, and silver's story in similar lighting. mephiles has three forms. its original form was an amorphous mass of darkness. in his second form, mephiles appears almost identical to shadow the hedgehog, aside from having <mark>green</mark> eyes with slit pupils, no visible mouth (though his muzzle moves when he speaks, as if he does have a mouth), and the fact that everything that is red on shadow is a pale powder blue on mephiles. his third and most common form was a crystalline, anthropomorphic hedgehog. in this form, he has no visible nose, mouth, or feet. edit mephiles was accidentally created during the iblis, its raw power, and mephiles, its cunning mind. mephiles was sealed in the shadow the hedgehog, who had traveled through time to ten years before the events of the game. doctor eggman somehow acquired the scepter of darkness. in the present day, the scepter was shattered during a struggle between eggman, shadow and rouge, and mephiles was released. mephiles then transformed into a copy of shadow by absorbing shadow's shadow, and in doing so absorbed shadow's powers as well. realizing that shadow did not know who mephiles was (as shadow had not yet travelled back in time to face mephiles in the past), mephiles transported shadow and rouge into the future. princess elise, in order to release the \"flames of disaster\" (a.k.a. iblis), who had been sealed inside elise's soul until she cried. mephiles intended to fuse with iblis, reuniting them into a single entity, solaris. sonic the hedgehog was the cause of iblis being released, which led to the destruction of their world. sonic was, thus, referred to as the \"iblis trigger\". he sent the two back in time, making them believe that killing sonic would save their future. along the way, as all three storylines progress, the three main characters discover how mephiles was somehow involved in the incident which created the \"flames of disaster\" , wielded by princess elise. mephiles has a very pivotal role in all of the storylines, throughout the course of the game. he has the most direct role in shadow's story. he also has a major role in silver's story, as he manipulates silver and blaze into attempting to kill sonic so that he can finally fuse with iblis. while he himself has a very minor role in sonic's story, where he is only seen when sonic, knuckles, and tails are eavesdropping on his conversation with silver and blaze that ends with them time-traveling back to present-day soleanna, his actions are still very much prevalent to sonic's story, especially with his encounters with silver. mephiles attempted to break shadow's will to fight and join him, much like black doom had, by revealing that in the current future, the world and an unwilling omega would turn against shadow and imprison him in suspended animation (mephiles keeps his hatred for shadow a secret). thus, he attempted to get shadow to join him, saying they would both get revenge on the world. however, shadow proved immune to mephiles' tactics, saying that he would determine his own destiny, leading to a battle between the two of them. though shadow took the upper-hand, mephiles knocked him into a wall with an energy blast and incapacitated him when he lowers his guard, but omega intervened and drove mephiles off. later, omega met mephiles again, who revealed to omega that he was one that would imprison shadow in the future, prompting the robot to shoot him with two miniguns. as shadow (along with silver after shadow foiled his second assassination attempt on sonic) had traveled back into the past at that point, he learned of mephiles' true nature (and silver learned that mephiles had lied about sonic being the iblis trigger). shadow, omega, and rouge later meet mephiles in the desert temple. again, mephiles offers shadow a chance to join him, but shadow, knowing mephiles' true intentions, flat-out refused the offer. mephiles was fought again and lost. after his seeming defeat, however, mephiles proved immune to being imprisoned in a new scepter of darkness that shadow tried to use on him, saying that it wouldn't work on him anymore (he implies that the reason he was immune was due to his time traveling to ten years ago, due to his line of \"the\" i \"of now absorbed your power through your shadow in the past .\" ). mephiles then uses two chaos emeralds to create an army of clones of himself. he then boasts to shadow that he can't defeat him, and asks why he is even bothering to protect a world that will eventually turn against him. shadow responds by saying, \"if the whole world decides to become my enemy, then i will fight like i always have\" , and, mirroring a similar ability from the, removes his bracelets and destroys the entire army in a massive burst of energy. in the last story, mephiles, having either escaped or simply survived the fight with shadow, finds the purple chaos emerald, uses it to warp to sonic and elise's location shortly after they escape eggman's exploding egg carrier, blinds them with the emerald's powers, and projects an energy spear that impales sonic through the back, killing him instantly. elise cries over his death and, as a result, releases iblis, allowing mephiles to fuse with him and transform into solaris (who is soon destroyed during a battle against shadow, silver and a revived sonic in super form). it is also revealed in the last story that mephiles' lie to silver and blaze about sonic being the iblis trigger was partially true: sonic is indeed the iblis trigger, but his death would not stop iblis's resurrection; in fact, his death would be the very event that would release iblis from elise's soul. the key to iblis's freedom was an event that would cause elise to become so consumed with despair or guilt that she would cry, as she had formed a very close friendship with sonic. mephiles as compared to shadow. note the color differences. oddly, mephiles' muzzle has jaged edges, but it may be due to an incomplete character model. unlike most of the villains in the sonic series, who are driven by a lust for power or revenge, mephiles (as shadow stated) only seems to crave destruction. he is portrayed as a cold, ruthless villain with no sense of compassion. he would do anything to accomplish his goals, even if it means taking innocent lives. mephiles happens to take great pleasure and delight in hurting others and has been shown to have a very warped and twisted sense of humor, making him a very sadistic and psychotic individual. for example, he made it his sole mission to cause pain to elise throughout the entire course of the game, and even broke out into a maniacal laughter after ending sonic's life. this is also seen when he taunts omega by telling him he would be reprogrammed to capture shadow. mephiles also happens to be highly intelligent, as he's capable of using and manipulating people to further his evil plans. this is shown when he preyed upon silver's frustration and desire to save the world, by deceiving him into thinking that sonic was responsible for everything, knowing that killing him would have done the exact opposite of what silver was trying to achieve. he also has nihilistic tendencies, as evidenced in his final fight against shadow, where he asks why shadow even bothers fighting at all, and why shadow even bothers defending humanity when they will inevitably persecute him later. it has also been speculated that mephiles might also be somewhat of a coward, judging from several actions he displayed throughout the game: he operated most of his plans secretively, and his main target, sonic, was almost totally unaware that he existed. he then killed sonic by impaling him through the back without warning, which usually in battle, attacking from behind is an act of cowardice. during both boss fights, mephiles hardly attacks on his own without aid, by either summoning shadows, or cloning himself to use as distractions. he uses the shadows in the first boss fight as shields, and increases the number of them when you get too close. also during the boss fights, he waits to attack you until your back is turned. he also doesn't fight you directly until you expel him from shadow's shadow. he also managed to convince silver and blaze into attempting to kill sonic before actually doing it himself, which would in turn release iblis, though there was a much stronger form of iblis already free in his time while he had a chaos emerald at hand. after he begins to lose the first boss fight, he promptly flees by opening a portal in time, and altering it before shadow and omega can jump through. in the time ten years previous to the story that takes place, when shadow corners the newly created mephiles before sealing him away, mephiles' voice sounds startled if not frightened before quickly shifting into his more recognizable tone as he makes a threat to shadow. mephiles appeared in sonic universe issue 29 as a cameo. probaly as a sign that mephiles will appear in other comics. mephiles also seems to have a habit of waving his hands when he speaks, as he's seen doing so in nearly all of his appearances, ranging from holding his hands up high while making a declaration, to holding them out to the sides slightly or even in front of himself while making himself appear as an ally to silver and blaze. mephiles also showed limited interest in people, taking particular interest in shadow, omega, silver and sonic, the latter only because he needed to kill him. mephiles is shown to hold a particular hate for shadow since it was he who sealed him in the scepter of darkness. this being said, mephiles did not acknowledge rouge, blaze or elise, whom he would have been aware of, while the rest of the game's cast did not know of him just as much as he did them. edit mephiles can manipulate and move through time with an ability similar to chaos control. his primary offensive technique is a massive sphere of black energy that is spawned from his hands that home in on their targets. he can also use the energy spheres to move himself and others through time. furthermore, he can alter his physical form to sink into the ground and merge with the shadow of another. he can also manipulate shadows to create \"clones\" of himself, although they are warped and imperfect without the power of the mephiles is also a highly skilled manipulator, as he was able to easily manipulate silver and blaze to nearly get his desired result. mephiles has also demonstrated the curious ability to, with one chaos emerald in his possession, warp the other six emeralds to his location instantly, which he did after the flames of disaster were released from elise and before reuniting with iblis. he is also shown to have adept knowledge on using modern technology, as evidenced by his knowing exactly which files in dr. eggman's computer to use when trying to persuade silver to assassinate sonic the hedgehog. this is most likely due to his apparently endless lifespan and time travel power allowing him to study the world around him for as long as he needs to. edit mephiles battles shadow after the latter refused his offer to join him. for the most part, mephiles hides in shadow's shadow, commanding his shadow clones to attack the black hedgehog. the shadow clones grab on to shadow, then detonate a few seconds after enough have grabbed on. shadow can avoid damage, however, if he is in the middle of using chaos attack when they explode. to draw mephiles out, shadow must defeat shadow clones to fill the energy gauge. each clone takes one hit to kill. they don't all have to be defeated, just enough to fill the energy gauge. once the energy gauge is completely filled, activate shadow's chaos boost ability to draw mephiles into the open. after that, the battle becomes more straightfoward. mephiles will mainly keep his distance from shadow, attacking him with large energy blasts. he may also command his shadow clones to \"dance\" around him, creating a large shield to protect him. but otherwise, dodge his attacks and attack until he is defeated. edit it seems that shadow is nearing victory, but mephiles gains the upper hand, knocking him away with an energy blast. he then proceeds to finish shadow off, but is interuptted by omega, who is here to support shadow. for this battle, the player takes control of omega. mephiles will now hide among his shadow clones to confuse the player. he still retains his energy blast attack, but can now fire smaller energy blasts. use omega's omega shot to attack mephiles. to make the fight easier, hold down the button to lock on to multiple enemies. then release to fire. edit mephiles now fights shadow as the final boss of the latter's story. mephiles' tactics are the same as the first battle, albeit with some changes. mephiles will float in the middle of the arena, waving his hands to command his shadow clones to dive into the floor. you cannot harm mephiles at this point, so take the opportunity to collect rings. once his clones have jumped in, mephiles himself will dive in (if you are too close to where he will dive in, you will take damage .). mephiles then will summon giant shadow monsters, made of numerous shadows. these giga-shadows attack by slamming the ground to create shockwaves, and firing a large laser from their mouths. despite their size, they can be defeated with a few good hits to the head. the player must defeat each giant shadow to fill the energy gauge. once the energy gauge is filled, activate chaos boost to return the shadow floor to normal and draw mephiles into the open. the fight is largely the same as the first, except that mephiles has two new attacks in his arsenal. he can now create perfect clones of himself, each with an energy blast. the player must find the real mephiles before they all fire their energy blasts. when desperate, mephiles will spiral upward, leaving a clone of himself and then firing an energy blast from above. to reach mephiles, use a homing attack on each clone until you reach mephiles. edit mephiles was voiced by <mark>dan green</mark>, the same actor who voices knuckles the echidna. in sonic the hedgehog, he is credited under the alias \"jay snyder\". dr. eggman had shown an interest in capturing mephiles, trying to take the scepter of darkness, and later when shadow asked eggman who mephiles was, he said he would tell him if he brought him mephiles. it isn't stated why eggman wanted to capture mephiles, but based on his actions in the game, it can be guessed that he had hoped to harness mephiles' powers to travel through time if he failed to do so with iblis, or that he needed both iblis and mephiles to completely control time. even though mephiles appears to lack a visible mouth, the general area on his \"muzzle\" moves in and out as he speaks in a manner similar to an inflating balloon. when mephiles is in the future, he has a purple chaos emerald, but later he doesn't have it or doesn't use it for some reason until last story. however since he can travel through time, the actions he does throughout the game could be in any unspecified order. it should also be noted that mephiles may have first heard his name while shadow trails after him during the aquatic base level, as shadow declares \"mephiles! i won't let you escape!\". since mephiles had not taken a name at the time, shadow may have inadvertently given him the idea for it, and the rest may have come from his element and the scepter itself. it may have also been all that he could see and sense in the scepter as well. many aspects of mephiles, most notably his hateful connection to shadow, his ability to make clones of himself, and his desire to flat out destroy existence in itself, bears several similarities to the matrix villain agent smith. also, his implied hatred of humanity mirrors agent smith's hatred of humanity. shadow and mephiles' final conversation in \"showdown with mephiles\" mirrors a similar conversation during the final fight between neo and agent smith in \"matrix revolutions\" though considered a key character to the plot of sonic 2006, having been arguably the main villain, of 11 other key characters to the game, (all the playables, eggman, elise, and excluding solaris, and iblis), mephiles interacted with only 3 of them directly (omega, shadow and silver), was sighted for sure by team dark and silver, and blaze, glimpsed briefly by team sonic (who mistook him for a shadow look-alike, and possibly never connected him to the events later). amy and eggman never meet him directly, and mephiles never once directed his attention from shadow, omega, silver, and to another extent, elise and the task of killing sonic to make her cry. mephiles never directly spoke to any female characters he encountered. it can be assumed that mephiles is physically very weak, as shown when mephiles was overcome by two individuals and even has a bit of trouble regaining his balance after bouncing on the ground. it's possible that mephiles might have a low tolerance for aggravation, which can be seen when shadow refused to join with him. the result of that was mephiles changing form and during the following boss fight, as well as the followup one later, snippets of dialogue suggest a more aggressive side, in which he will growl and even make threats. however, being that both fights are paired against shadow and only shadow, it's also likely that due to mephiles' hatred towards him, that this was merely a display of hostility. in his crystalline form, it's possible that his quills and ears, and for that matter, the rest of himself, is as pliable as it would be in his shadow form, as several cutscenes show the quills bending and being influenced by movement, and in one scene, his ear twitches slightly. mario & sonic at the olympic winter games, shadow will bear a great resemblance to mephiles after wiping-out on any skiing or snowboarding event. mephiles is the only villain who has managed to kill sonic. mephiles is the only character in sonic '06 without an official artwork sonic universe issue 29 where he is sitting next to an alternate version of mephitis, the personification of the poisonous gases emitted from the ground in swamps and volcanic vapors. edit \"ah ha ha ha ha! oh how ironic fate can be .\" mephiles' first line in shadow's story \"i thank you, shadow the hedgehog .\" - mephiles introducing

"content": "* policymakers adjust structure of permanent bailout fund * no \"preferred status' for existing bailout recipients * decision should be positive for ireland, greece, portugal (adds details, changes byline) <mark>john o'donnell</mark> luxembourg, june 20 (reuters) - the euro zone's permanent bailout fund will not have preferred creditor status if it lends to greece, ireland or portugal, but would be paid back first in other cases, euro zone finance ministers decided on monday. the european stability mechanism (esm) will come into effect in june 2013, replacing the temporary european financial stability facility that was set up last year. it will have an effective lending capacity of 500 billion euros ($710 billion). the initial agreement between euro zone countries was that all esm loans, which will be provided to highly indebted governments in exchange for reforms, would enjoy preferred creditor status, junior only to the international monetary fund. efsf loans are on equal footing with private creditors. that would have meant that esm loans would have to be paid back before private bondholders were--a prospect that investors have said would discourage private creditors from buying the bonds of those countries already forced to seek bailouts. however, finance ministers agreed on a compromise to ease market concerns. esm loans to the three greece, ireland and portugal will not get preferential treatment. at the same time, any euro zone member states that need emergency financial assistance from the esm in the future would not benefit from the same exemption--the esm and imf would still have to be repaid first .\" it (the esm) will not have preferred creditor status as regards countries that are already in a support programme...it will make it easier for them to come back to the market, \"the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, jean-claude juncker, told a news conference. irish finance minister <mark>michael noonan</mark> welcomed the compromise, saying it would help dublin return to the market .\" we hope to complete our programme and get back into the markets in 2012 or 2013. but those that would be lending to us...they would be cautious that we might have to go for a second programme under the esm and the very prospect of it would stop them lending to us, because of the fact that they would be taking a bigger risk and the esm would have the preferred status, \"<mark>noonan</mark> told reporters .\" the esm will have the same status as a creditor as anybody who lends to ireland. that makes it easier for us to get back into the market, \"<mark>noonan</mark> said .\" there should be people prepared to lend to us who won't be inhibited by incurring the greater risk from the esm as originally drafted, \"he said. the decision to remove the preferred creditor status of the esm for greece, portugal and ireland may ease the private sector's concerns about rolling over greek debt, a key sticking point of an expected second bailout package for athens. if private creditors know they have the same status as the esm when it comes to being repaid, then they are more likely to remain invested in greece, portugal and ireland, particularly if they are asked to retain long-term exposure.

markakis, orioles pound struggling pirates 8-3 pittsburgh (ap)--baltimore orioles pitcher jake arrieta didn't have his best stuff on monday night against the pittsburgh pirates. the way his teammates are hitting when he's on the mound these days, his best is hardly required. arrieta moved into a tie for the american league lead in wins, taking advantage of another offensive outburst as the orioles pounded the struggling pirates 8-3. \"i really don't know what it is, the team, they find a way to put runs on the board when i'm on the mound,\" arrieta said. \"it's a good feeling for me. i'm not going to argue with it .\" the orioles are averaging 6.5 runs when arrieta (9-4) starts, a number they topped in the second inning while chasing pittsburgh starter charlie morton (7-4). baltimore has scored at least seven runs 11 times this season, and arrieta has started seven of those games. nick markakis added three hits to extend his hitting streak to 11 games as baltimore continued to light up the scoreboard when arrieta takes the hill. and for a night anyway, arrieta got in on the act. he collected his first major league hit, a bloop to shallow right field that scored <mark>mark reynolds</mark> to cap baltimore's five-run first inning. \"i got an at-bat in the first, something i really didn't expect to do,\" arrieta said. \"it was a fun game to be a part of .\" the hit helped take some of the pressure off on a night when arrieta was hardly dominant. he gave up three runs in five innings on a sticky night in which he labored through 87 pitches. orioles manager buck showalter called arrieta's performance \"so-so,\" yet it was enough to lift him into a five-way tie with for the al lead in victories. the rest of the list includes some of the top pitchers in the game, including detroit's justin verlander and new york's cc sabathia. though his era is a pedestrian 4.50, arrieta is more concerned with the scoreboard at the end of the night. \"it's a good feeling, being on top of the board with some of the big names around the league,\" he said. \"i'd like to stay on pace with them. i feel like i have the stuff and ability .\" baltimore handed the pirates their fourth straight loss by pouncing on morton, whose june swoon continued on a night in which he gave up seven runs - six earned - and eight hits in two innings. he fell to 2-2 this month with an era of 8.50. his resurgence has been one of the pleasant surprises in a pleasantly surprising season for the pirates. he endured a miserable 2010 in which he went 2-12 with a 7.57 era, but has revived his career thanks to an improved sinker. it rarely worked against the orioles, who took morton's favorite pitch and sprayed it all over pnc park, which had a fair share of orange in the stands from baltimore fans who made the relatively short trip west for the game. pittsburgh manager clint hurdle blamed morton's woes on a heavy workload. \"i think it's a stamina issue that he's trying to fight through,\" hurdle said. \"that has caused him to elevate the ball much more than he was earlier this season .\" maybe, but morton's issues began well before his pitch count could get out of hand. j.j. hardy led off the game with an infield hit and markakis followed a double. both came home on a two-run single by <mark>adam jones</mark> and surging derrek lee added another rbi single before morton managed to get an out. \"it's nice to get an early lead like that, but more importantly we continued to build on it,\" lee said. morton's misery, however, was just beginning as robert andino chipped in an rbi single before arrieta got in on the act, lofting a flare into shallow right field, a run-scoring single that gave the orioles a 5-0 lead. the onslaught continued in the second behind an rbi double by matt wieters and a sacrifice fly by <mark>mark reynolds</mark>. that was more than enough for arrieta, who labored at times but was never in any real danger against the suddenly reeling pirates. pittsburgh appeared to be on the verge of a breakthrough last week, ripping off four straight wins to climb two games above .500 this late in the season for the first time in 12 years. four losses have followed, all to american league teams that have found a way to quiet pittsburgh's bats. the pirates have managed just seven runs during the slide, their longest since dropping six straight from may 10-16. the victory gave the orioles consecutive wins for the first time in nearly two weeks as baltimore improved to 33-37. the orioles didn't win their 33rd game last year until aug. 3. \"i feel like this team has been pretty relaxed all year, we've just been a little bit streaky,\" lee said. \"we need to find a way to play like this more often .\" ", "articleID": "2011062103_00094044_W", "names": {"Adam Jones": ["Q1060788", "Q16232662", "Q2537838", "Q2823965", "Q29787083", "Q349892", "Q350686", "Q43101011", "Q4679305"], "Mark Reynolds": ["Q1047714", "Q1265875", "Q16223397", "Q26936702", "Q928463"]}}]
