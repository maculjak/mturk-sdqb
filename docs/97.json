yep, i did, and i'll use it again here, because code (you don't think i'm writing shakespeare every time, do you?) is fun, fast, clever, with cool villains, solid character interaction, and nice special effects. code is an historical serial that sees the doctor and martha traveling back to 1599 to see a performance of love's labour's lost. martha asks all those questions that the audience asks, like, how does the tardis work, but the doctor gives her short shrift on the answers. he says things like, \"don't worry about it,\" and \"do you intend to kill your grandfather? no, then don't worry about it .\" i get that they have to play these scenes like this because it would slow the story down, but it's a bit condescending. you let the doctor get away with it because while his answers are condescending, his tone isn't, and martha doesn't seem to mind with all the hurrying around. later, when they plop down to share a bed for the night (fully clothed and above the sheets), the doctor's a bit more of a dick and martha is peeved then. they're all going on about the mystery and you can see that martha is getting a bit starry-eyed at the doctor and he's totally focused on the mystery and says something like, \"if rose were here, she'd say the perfect thing .\" martha scowls and rolls over, blowing out the candle light. there's a couple ways to look at this bit. one is that this is more of the doctor's well-documented naivete when it comes to women and that he just doesn't understand how this is going to be interpreted by martha. another way, of course, is that he's just being a callous dick. or maybe he knows exactly what that big-eyed look martha is giving him means and he's purposely being a dick in order to remind everyone that he's not walking down romance road this time around. i know a lot of people dislike rose (i don't) and i know a lot of people dislike seeing the doctor romantically involved with a companion (i do, though i can understand why he fell for rose, given the context of the time war), but just because we don't like it doesn't mean we can't still see stories generated from the idea of a romantic engagement. or even just a one night stand. companions (at least the human ones) tend to be contemporary with the audience at home, and it's not 1965 anymore. while maybe the doctor hasn't changed his sexual mores, women on television have changed. while seeing martha make a few doe eyes at the doctor isn't the high point of the episode, it's not hard to imagine getting swept up in the romance of the tardis. especially, you know, since the doctor now looks like david tennant and not william hartnell. i'm just saying. after the performance of lll, the doctor and martha stop in to see shakespeare. he wants nothing to do with his fans until he sees martha and decides he wants everything to do with this fan. there's such great chemistry between the doctor and martha that it's a joy just to watch them talk to one another. both of them take easily to the rapid-paced dialogue. (it really does seem like people are talking faster this season, but maybe i'm just saying that because the chemistry is better .) upon meeting shakespeare, martha tries to fit in by saying, \"verily,\" \"forsooth,\" and \"for odin! for asgard!\" and the doctor softly tells her, \"don't do that .\" again, it can be read as a bit condescending, but again, the delivery doesn't match the tone of the words. there's a bunch of racially-tinged dialogue, which the doctor diffuses by telling shakes that martha is from the nation of freedonia. dean lennox kelly is fantastic as shakespeare. god knows how historically accurate his shakes is, but the character presented here works wonderfully. he's loving where his life is at the moment, reveling in the attention his plays bring him, and fascinated by the doctor and martha. when the doctor tries out his psychic paper bit, shakespeare sees it as blank paper, not, \"sir doctor of tardis\" (a reference to tooth and claw). <mark>gareth roberts</mark> makes his first screenplay contribution to the franchise (though certainly not his last) and he's firing on all cylinders. he has a fantastic ability, not unlike aaron sorkin, to run a show on two lines at the same time with the same characters at breakneck speed. there's the overarching plot-driven dialogue but then there's the character-driven ongoing conversation that gets peppered throughout the show. when it works, it's a joy to watch. here, it's the continual fascination of shakes with martha; as the doctor, martha, and shakespeare concentrate on the mystery, shakes is also quizzing/hitting on martha and this strange land of freedonia where women are allowed to do be equal members of society. the mystery at play in this episode involves three witches that are really aliens that want to take over the earth. they use their \"magic\" to attack people and hypnotize shakespeare to write the ending they want for the ending of love's labour's won. it's not that they're critics of his work, but that getting the actors to perform the right series of words will open the gateway to allow the aliens in. the youngest witch (played by christina cole) disguises herself as a young, attractive working class woman who uses her looks to manipulate people and hide in plain sight. because it's never the cute one, right? shakespeare code moves fast and with copious amounts of charm. freema agyeman is so much better at playing off tennant that billie piper that it seems to inject the whole show with a confidence it was lacking during series 2. two episodes into series 3 and it seems apparent this show knows exactly what it is and knows exactly how to deliver it to the audience. good stuff.", "articleID": "2011020300_00024115_W", "names": {"Charles Palmer": ["Q22907586", "Q28477735", "Q30090138", "Q5081477"], "Gareth Roberts": ["Q1103587", "Q30604186", "Q3098309", "Q46270269", "Q5522955", "Q5522957", "Q5522961", "Q56709362"]}}, {"date": "2011-02-04", "url": "http://thehockeynews.com/articles/38144-Bruins-forward-Daniel-Paille-suspended-four-games-for-blindside-hit.html", "content": "bruins forward <mark>daniel paille</mark> suspended four games for blindside hit 2011-02-04 12:20:00 toronto - boston bruins forward <mark>daniel paille</mark> was suspended four games by the nhl friday for delivering a blindside hit to the head, becoming the fifth player to receive a ban under rule 48 this season. <mark>paille</mark> hit dallas stars forward raymond sawada on thursday night and received a match penalty on the play. sawada suffered a broken nose and a shoulder sprain. the nhl's discipline review was conducted by senior vice-president of hockey operations <mark>mike murphy</mark> because league disciplinarian <mark>colin campbell</mark>'s son gregory plays for the bruins. \"<mark>paille</mark> delivered a lateral hit where the principal point of contact was his opponent's head,\" <mark>murphy</mark> said in a statement. \"additionally, the injury suffered by the dallas player was a factor in this decision .\" <mark>paille</mark> will forfeit us $23,118.28 in salary and is eligible to return feb. 15 against toronto. the rule 48 penalty for illegal checks to the head was brought in prior to the season and has been the subject of much debate. the other four players suspended this year for head hits are: toronto's <mark>mike brown</mark> (three games); islanders winger <mark>matt martin</mark> (two games); san jose's joe thornton (two games); and shane doan of the coyotes (three games). view all \"the ducks are one of the teams that i've been talking to. it goes both ways, right?
