there is no heroism in brutally attacking peace convoys to break the siege around gaza. there is no heroism in attacking peaceful demonstrations against the wall and against the expansion of colonial settlement. if israel is not confronted with punitive resolutions, israel's madness would keep going .\" by holding on to talmudic and torah myths, israel appears unable to achieve balance with violence committed on a daily basis brutalising palestinians economically, politically and culturally, igniting a huge fire that shall very soon drag the israelis into its heat. it is important to remember that israel will not be the first entity who would be committing suicide by the hand of her sons! email a friend emailing an article to friend is a simple way to share a news item. your friend will receive an email with your name and email address as well any personal message you choose to send. the information you provide on this page will not be used to send unsolicited emails. opec needs to present a united front organisation has to sort out internal rivalries and enhance investment to tackle western challenges to its influence", "articleID": "2010091718_00130604_W", "names": {"Abdul Rahman": ["Q25471383", "Q2632820", "Q26955606", "Q317395", "Q4665622", "Q4665623", "Q48970513"]}}, {"date": "2010-09-20", "url": "http://arkansasbusiness.com/article.aspx?aID=123849.54928.135992", "content": "the university of arkansas football program has its sights set on winning the southeastern conference championship and bcs national title this season. doing so would likely help football recruiting, provide additional athletic department revenue and boost national exposure to the athletic department and the ua at large. a championship also would bump the compensation of coach bobby petrino to more than $3 million. petrino, as is the trend with college coaches across the country in all sports, has performance-based incentive clauses built into his already substantial contract. winning a national championship and the sec title in the same year would net petrino a $250,000 supplement to his $2.7 million annual compensation package.

less on grand, dramatic strikes, obama administration officials and leaders of the senate homeland security panel said wednesday. that makes it harder to prevent attacks, the officials said. and it poses problems for congress that lawmakers haven't yet resolved, such as debates over the treatment and prosecution of u.s. citizens involved in terror plots. michael e. leiter, director of the national counterterrorism center, told the committee that al qaeda in pakistan \"is weaker today than at any time since the late 2001 onset\" of the war on terror. but at the same time, he warned, the terrorism threat at home has grown \"more complex,\" and the \"number and pace of attacks\" has been greater over the past year than in any other since sept. 11. committee chairman joseph i. lieberman, i-conn., said at least 63 u.s. citizens have been charged with or convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related crimes since last year, an \"astoundingly high number of people who have attacked or planned to attack their own country .\" <mark>susan collins</mark> of maine, the senate panel's top republican, said that since may of last year, there were 19 plots uncovered involving u.s. citizens, almost as many as the 21 such plots uncovered in the entire period between the sept. 11, 2001, attacks and last may. \"i am convinced that terrorists are beginning to focus their efforts on smaller-scale attacks with small arms and explosives such as we saw at fort hood...and in india,\" she said. homeland security secretary janet napolitano told the committee that terrorists were diversifying tactics and targets, which translates into \"fewer opportunities to detect and prevent plots .\" mortgage rates hit 3.25% if you owe less than $729k you probably qualify for obamas

bill of rights\" in a public event wednesday. photo courtesy of the perriello office. president obama's patient protection and affordable care act was officially put into effect yesterday. proponents of the health care reform law emphasize the protections for privately insured consumers outlined in the \"patient's bill of rights .\" congressman tom perriello, d-charlottesville, highlighted those key patient rights and protections in a wednesday statement to the press. for example, virginians will have protective provisions against the denial of coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, the arbitrary cancellation of health coverage and lifetime limits on health coverage. other benefits include the rights patients will have \"to key preventive services without deductible or co-payments\" and to choose their own doctors within their insurer networks. perriello publicly discussed the \"patient's bill of rights\" wednesday at events in charlottesville and ferrum, va. \"we met parents with kids who have chronic illnesses,\" said <mark>michael kelly</mark>, deputy press secretary for the periello campaign, adding that those parents now have the freedom to make critical decisions about their healthcare under the new law. perriello and other supporters of the health care reform law emphasize that the \"reforms? put patients and doctors, not the health insurance companies, back in charge of health care decisions,\" according to perriello's press release. nevertheless, robert hurt, perriello's challenger in the upcoming congressional midterm election, believes that the health care reform bill is more detrimental than beneficial for virginians. \"robert believes that the government takeover of health care should be repealed and replaced,\" hurt campaign spokesperson amanda hennenberg said. \"it's no surprise that congressman perriello continues to champion? government takeover of health care that raises rates and taxes, kills jobs and adds burdensome costs onto the backs of small businesses and cuts medicare by $500 billion .\" other sources have shown that the health care reform policy could have some negative effects. the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced tuesday that 1.2 million seniors will be dropped from the medicare advantage or medicare prescription drug plan that is currently in place. in addition, small-town doctors who rely on medicare patients may suffer from these reported effects. despite how polarized views on the bill can be, isaac wood, media representative at the center for politics and a former cavalier daily opinion columnist, said he believes the health care policy's recent implementation will not affect the upcoming congressional election. \"i feel like many people have already made up their mind about the health care reform bill one way or another,\" wood said. \"unless they seem personally affected or changed, i don't think you will see a lot of change in the polls based on this alone .\" a new benenson strategy group poll released tuesday shows that democrat tom perriello and republican robert hurt are statistically tied. the poll revealed that 44 percent and 46 percent of likely general election voters would vote for perriello and hurt, respectively. wood called this poll more accurate than some previous polls that showed larger margins. \"anyone living in this district knows that [the election] is not a blowout - the margin is really small,\" he said. the congressional midterm election will take place nov. 2. mail (will not be published) (required) is

from time to time - especially when the cost of heating those drafty old palaces spirals past $1.5 million a year. but a request for assistance from a government fund that provides subsidized heating to low-income britons has caused a spot of bother for queen elizabeth ii, long one of the world's wealthiest women. her majesty's application in 2004 was politely turned down by the government - in part because of fear of adverse publicity - and quietly forgotten until the independent newspaper published the correspondence friday after getting it via a freedom of information request. the documents quote an unidentified functionary as gently reminding the royal household that the program was meant for people in need, not the upper crust, and he noted the potential public-relations disaster. \"i also feel a bit uneasy about the probable adverse press coverage if the palace were given a grant at the expense of, say, a hospital,\" the official said. \"sorry this doesn't sound more positive .\" chagrined palace officials confirmed the account friday. a buckingham palace spokeswoman said royal officials explored the possibility of getting money under the program as a way to reduce the monarchy's cost to taxpayers by making the palace more energy-efficient. she said the royal household did not know at the time that the government money was targeted for low-income britons. she spoke anonymously in line with royal policy. the revelation touched a nerve at a time when britain is facing severe budget cuts in the midst of a prolonged recession. <mark>graham smith</mark>, spokesman for the anti-monarchy group republic, said the queen's attempt to access low-income funds was shameful. \"it is clear evidence of the contempt the palace has for ordinary people in this country,\" he said. the 84-year-old queen's finances have been controversial in the past, with occasional debates about whether britain's head of state - whose role is largely ceremonial - costs taxpayers too much. taxpayers fund the royal household to the tune of $60 million, or 38.2 million pounds, a year. the monarch's official website points out it costs britain's 62 million people less than a dollar (62 pence) each. royally cold buckingham palace has been in royal hands since king george iii bought it in 1761 and has been the official london residence of britain's monarchs since 1837. although it has magnificent gardens and grand state rooms with priceless paintings and furniture, large parts of the 775-room palace have not been modernized and are cold and drafty. use the
