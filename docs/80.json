Picture by <mark>Prem Singh</mark> New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed petitions from Congress politicians Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes that had challenged the reopening of their tax assessments for 2011-12. The bench of Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and A.K. Chawla said: \"The writ petitions have failed.\" On August 16, the high court had reserved its order after the income-tax department contended that Rahul's tax assessment for 2011-12 had been reopened on the ground of the concealment of material facts. The bench had orally asked the income-tax department not to take any coercive step against Sonia, Rahul or Fernandes till it had pronounced its verdict. Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, appearing for Sonia, had said he had faith in the oral statement made by additional solicitor-general Tushar Mehta. Mehta had argued that the Congress politicians had alleged mala fide on the part of the income-tax department but had not made any averments on this. Rahul Gandhi offers water from Kailash Mansarovar at Rajghat on Monday. Picture by <mark>Prem Singh</mark> The income-tax cases against the Congress politicians had arisen from a probe into a private criminal complaint lodged by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy with a trial court in connection with the National Herald newspaper case. Swamy has accused Sonia, Rahul and others of conspiring to misappropriate funds by floating a company called Young Indian that paid only Rs 50 lakh for the right to recover assets worth Rs 90.25 crore that Associated Journals Ltd, the publisher, owed the Congress. The income-tax department has said the shares Rahul has in Young Indian would lead him to have an income of Rs 154 crore and not around Rs 68 lakh, as was assessed earlier. It has already issued a demand notice for Rs 249.15 crore to Young Indian for the assessment year 2011-12. The department's move followed its probe into a complaint alleging the Gandhis had misappropriated Associated Journals' assets while transferring their shares to the newly formed Young Indian.

Cole DelbyckEntertainment Writer, The Huffington PostPosted: 11/04/2015 09:38 AM EST | Edited: 16 minutes ago Eat your heart out, Harry Potter. The film version of J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" prequel, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" has been shrouded in secrecy ever since the project was announced in 2013. That is, until now. Entertainment Weekly's newest cover star is Newt Scamander, the movie's protagonist and world renowned magizoologist (a person who studies magical creatures) played by Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne, who sets out on an adventure in 1926 New York. Entertainment Weekly Things to note: Redmayne is sporting Scamander's signature briefcase and standing in the hallowed halls of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (or MACUSA), the magical governing body for the American witches and wizards. <mark>Colin Farrell</mark>, Samantha Morton, Ezra Miller and Katherine Waterston are also set to join Redmayne on the magical adventure. The official title design for \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" was released on Tuesday on the film's Instagram account with a mysterious caption that reads, \"Prepare yourself for the beasts are coming.\" "}, {"articleID": "2018081415_00193686_W", "names": {"Tom Hardy": ["Q208026", "Q21572165", "Q7816088", "Q7816089"], "Peter Parker": ["Q19596717", "Q21165177", "Q51587673", "Q56513979", "Q7176298"]}, "date": "2018-08-14", "url": "http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/new-venom-fan-art-gives-sinister-symbiote-classic-look/", "content": "x Unfortunately, whether or not Spider-Man will indeed be swinging by Ruben Fleischer's Venom is as up in the air as ever. That said, even if the eponymous web-head does unexpectedly drop in, it likely won't be the \"friendly neighborhood\" version we're all used to. After all, Holland's twenty-something web-slinger just doesn't fit the bill. Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped the fandom from envisioning what <mark>Tom Hardy</mark>'s Eddie Brock locked in battle with the current portrayer of <mark>Peter Parker</mark> could look like. At the beginning of the month, a delectable piece of fan art--or so it would appear to Venom--depicting the cantankerous Klyntar administering a chokehold onto the Iron Spider exploded online. Far-fetched, if nothing else, the image spurred on a new fan theory in which a Redditor theorized that Andrew Garfield could feasibly reprise his role as <mark>Peter Parker</mark>, seeing as the thirty-four-year-old actor would fit in much \"better with the new Venom film.\" Regardless, apparently feasibility isn't something the Holland fanbase is concerned with, as you'll see below. Instagram user Spdrmnkyxxiii posted an updated version of his piece of fan art in which the iconic white encrusted spider symbol is applied to the back of <mark>Hardy</mark>'s symbiote, and Holland's Spider-Man has taken the proverbial place of the \"turd in the wind.\" New Venom Fan Art Gives The Sinister Symbiote A Classic Look 1 of 2 Click to skip MORE FROM THE WEB Click to zoom The latest intel on the situation, at least according to director Ruben Fleischer, is that the titular web-head will not be apart of Venom. Although, seeing as <mark>Tom Hardy</mark> did give Holland quite a tongue lashing at SDCC last month, I suppose anything's possible. Hell, even Fleischer himself has teased that it might just become a reality one day. Until then, though, we'll just have to make due with creative fan art. Which, by the way, is totally fine with us.

The Chainsmokers to light up Liacouras Center in Philadelphia on Saturday By Ed Condran, correspondent 0 Chris Pizzello/Associated Press \"It's been crazy,\" Alex Pall (right) says of the success he and Drew Taggart have enjoyed as the Chainsmokers. According to the National Health Interview Survey, cigarette smoking among adults and teens has dropped dramatically over recent years. However, according to the Billboard charts, the Chainsmokers are all the rage. There was no secondhand smoke when the Chainsmokers--Alex Pall and Drew Taggart--played South By Southwest in March. The fans who jammed into the Sony party to catch the charismatic EDM-pop duo during the annual music festival/conference couldn't get enough of the act. But that's no surprise considering how well the Chainsmokers have been doing on the charts. The catchy single \"Roses\" reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Don't Let Me Down\" became their first top-five single and won the Grammy Award for best dance recording. \"Closer\" became their first No. 1 single on the chart. \"It's been crazy,\" Pall says. \"But it's a good crazy. We are running around so much that we don't get a chance to absorb all of this.\" It's been a whirlwind since the tandem hooked up in 2012. In just five years, the celebrated act is headlining arenas. \"Things have happened quickly for us but we've worked hard for this,\" Pall says. \"We're constantly working.\" The Chainsmokers, who will perform Saturday at the Liacouras Center, are touring behind their first full-length album, \"Memories: Do Not Open,\" which dropped in April. \"Memories\" is cut from the same cloth as the act's EP, 2016's \"Collage.\" The new tunes are witty, playful and hook-laden. \"It Wont' Kill You\" and \"Wake Up Alone\" sound like future hits. Fans danced enthusiastically to the party rock anthems in Austin. \"You never know what's going to happen,\" Pall says. \"We're just happy to have the opportunity to make music.\" It wasn't that long ago that Pall was working as an art gallery receptionist in New York, which is where he grew up. Taggart was an intern at Interscope Records when they met. \"We had this huge connection over music,\" Pall says. \"Calvin Harris, Deadmau5 and David Guetta are some of the artists we talked about when we met. We got together all of the time to make music. It was slow at the start but we started to get it going. The cool thing was that we got some good feedback.\" Less than two years after meeting, the Chainsmokers scored with \"#Selfie,\" which became a viral sensation. \"That was a joke but it blew up,\" Pall says. \"We were just having fun, messing around and it took off. We were in an odd spot since we really didn't have anything else...to showcase. We were just getting started and we didn't expect anyone to get that excited over it (' #Selfie').\" But when the Chainsmokers were pressed to come up with material, the pair came through. \"We love making music,\" Pall says. \"The fame can get in the way. But we try to ignore that stuff and just focus on what matters. It's all about the songs.\" There should be plenty of future for the Chainsmokers since Pall is 31 and Taggart is just 27. \"We're excited about everything,\" Pall says. \"The response has been amazing. We love our fans but we know we have so much ahead of us. We have a lot of work to do.\" Enjoying our content? Become a Intelligencer subscriber to support stories like these.
