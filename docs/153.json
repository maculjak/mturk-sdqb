But the opposition says Mr Rudd must go further and release all documents relating to advice to him about problems with the scheme, set up during his first term as prime minister. The issue re-emerged just over a week into Mr Rudd's return to the leadership after Queensland coroner <mark>Michael Barnes</mark> handed down a damning report into the deaths of three men. Mr <mark>Barnes</mark> found the rushed rollout of the scheme was a significant factor in the deaths of installers Matthew Fuller, Rueben <mark>Barnes</mark> and Mitchell Sweeney in Queensland. A fourth man, <mark>Marcus Wilson</mark>, died in November 2009 from hypothermia complications with installing batts in a Sydney house. Mr Rudd, who rolled out the scheme to create jobs during the global financial crisis, issued a public apology to the men's families on Thursday during a trip to Jakarta. On Friday, a spokesman for Mr Rudd said the prime minister would meet with any of the parents who wished to meet him in private. \"These events are tragic - and despite what the opposition might believe, they are not some opportunity for a headline.\" Lawyer Peter Koutsoukis, representing Mr Sweeney's family, told AAP they would appreciate a face-to-face apology, even though \"no amount of apologies can bring Mitchell back\" . Opposition Leader <mark>Tony Abbott</mark> said an apology was an important \"first step\" . But Mr Rudd should also release all 10 warnings he personally received between August 2009 and March 2010 and any others he was aware of relating to the scheme, which also has been linked to 250 fires. Four of the letters were from the then minister in charge of the program, Peter Garrett, who is quitting parliament at the next election. A cabinet committee is known to have discussed the scheme's safety issues in October 2009 and February 2010. \"I think he's got a bit of explaining to do,\" Mr <mark>Abbott</mark> said. Mr Rudd's spokesman said Mr <mark>Abbott</mark> was calling for release of information already made public, except for confidential cabinet documents. The victims' families are considering claims against the state and federal governments. Mr Albanese said the pace at which the program had been rolled out allowed dodgy operators to take advantage. \"What these findings highlight is that because of the pace of the scheme, in some places unscrupulous operators didn't give staff appropriate health and safety training, and that has led to these consequences,\" he said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said the deaths were a tragedy and the government would look closely at the coroner's report. Mr Garrett apologised for the bungled program and defended his own actions in the matter, but accused Mr <mark>Abbott</mark> of playing politics. \"Of course I'm terribly sorry about what happened,\" Mr Garrett told reporters on Friday. The former Midnight Oil frontman said two independent reviews showed he had acted appropriately during the home insulation roll-out. \"At all times I've served the country to the best of my ability,\" Mr Garrett said. \"It's on the public record...you can come to your own conclusions about those matters.

The Season from Hell: Inside Roger Goodell's Ruthless Football Machine, \"Gabriel Sherman outlines just how close Goodell and <mark>Kraft</mark> have been and how it was <mark>Kraft</mark> that backed Goodell during the uproar over how the league handled the <mark>Ray Rice</mark> domestic assault scandal.

But when the incidents are viewed as a whole, they suggest that Goodell has lost his most important ally. Here is a rundown <mark>Kraft</mark>'s recent actions: Prior to one of coach Bill Belichick's Super Bowl press conferences, <mark>Kraft</mark> made a surprise appearance and demanded an apology from the NFL if they are unable to prove that the Patriots intentionally deflated the footballs, noting that he is\" disappointed in the way this entire matter has [been] handled. \"<mark>Kraft</mark> was a no-show to Goodell's pre-Super Bowl state-of-the-league address, a move considered unusual for an owner of one of the team's in the Super Bowl, especially one so close to the commissioner (). After being handed the Lombardi Trophy following the Super Bowl, <mark>Kraft</mark> did not acknowledge the commissioner at all, something that raised the eyebrows of many. Mike Reiss, who covers the Patriots for ESPN.com and whom <mark>Peter King</mark> of SI.com calls\" well-plugged-in, \"recently wrote that it appears that the relationship between Goodell and <mark>Kraft</mark>\" is not in a good place \"and the biggest issue is the leaks that came from Goodell's office.\" My sense is that <mark>Kraft</mark> feels stung by Goodell, who he had backed in the wake of the mishandled <mark>Ray Rice</mark> domestic violence case, \"Reiss wrote for ESPN.com.\" The longstanding relationship between the two is not in a good place based on the league's handling of the team's under-inflated footballs and specifically public leaks. For perhaps the first time, I sense <mark>Kraft</mark> is doubting Goodell's leadership, and if Goodell loses one of his top supporters I wonder how much it could threaten his hold on the job. \"NFL commissioner Roger Goodell could be losing his biggest supporter because of\" Deflategate' and his job suddenly looks less secure NFL commissioner Roger Goodell could be losing his biggest supporter because of \"Deflategate' and his job suddenly looks less secure These articles have been shared on your timeline.

(\"Nighthawk\" ) (TSX VENTURE: NHK) is pleased to announce it has entered into a binding option agreement, with Geomark Exploration Ltd. (\"Geomark\" ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine Cliff Energy Ltd., to acquire 4 contiguous mining leases adjacent to Nighthawk's existing property in the Northwest Territories (\"NWT\" ) (Figure 1). HIGHLIGHTS:--Agreement encompasses the Kim and Cass gold deposits (Figure 2) as well as multiple other prospects within the Indin Lake Greenstone Belt;--Kim and Cass represent the final strategic properties to be incorporated into Nighthawk's Indin Lake Gold Project;--Nighthawk's land package will increase in size by 7,588 acres to 229,791 acres total;--Over 32,000 metres of reported historic drilling completed with much of the core remaining intact. Drilling highlights from the Cass Zone include intercepts of:--81.55 metres of 4.50 grams per tonne (\"g/t\" ) gold from hole C87-35;--52.00 metres of 5.10 g/t gold from hole C95-06;--64.40 metres of 4.08 g/t gold from hole C87-23; and--Prior to the implementation of NI 43-101, previous work conducted on the properties defined historic gold resource estimates of significant grade and continuity that have yet to be fully evaluated. Nighthawk President & CEO, David Wiley, commented, \"In this challenging market environment, we remain committed to adding value for our shareholders. We are fortunate to have a healthy balance sheet, a low cash burn rate and now the final strategic pieces of what we believe is a world class gold camp. These leases contain the Kim and Cass deposits plus numerous drill ready targets where previous owners have already completed a significant amount of work. We believe the historical data may be sufficient to apply towards our next resource estimate update and we will be working with the author of our technical report to incorporate this new information.\" Figure 1. - Location Map of Leases Optioned from Geomark Under the agreement with Geomark, Nighthawk has optioned 4 contiguous mining leases which include the Kim and Cass gold deposits and other gold showings. On signing the agreement, Nighthawk granted Geomark a 2.5% net smelter royalty on the 4 leases (of which 1.5% can be repurchased for $1,500,000) and paid $250,000, one-half of which is to be satisfied through the issuance of 1,768,345 common shares of Nighthawk. Subsequent option payments totalling $1,300,000 are staged in tranches over the next three years as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due Date Payment---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2014 $300,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2015 $450,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- on or before December 31, 2016 $550,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nighthawk has the right to satisfy one-half of each of the option payments in common shares, subject to receipt of requisite approval including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange should Nighthawk elect to issue common shares. Upon making the final payment, Nighthawk will own 100% of the mining leases. Property Highlights Historical Resource Estimates The Kim Main Zone, hosted by mafic volcanic rocks, and the Cass Zone, hosted by gabbro, represent significant underexplored gold deposits within the Indin Lake Gold Camp. Several historical resource estimates that pre-date the implementation of NI 43-101, were calculated for each of the deposits. The most recent of these was compiled in 1995 by 1Royal Oak Mines Inc. (\"Royal Oak\" ), the previous operator of the Colomac Gold Mine. They reported a possible geological resource based upon relatively shallow drilling (150 metres) for the Cass and Kim Zones presented in Table 1 below. Table 1. Historical Resource Estimate for Cass and Kim Zones Zone Cutoff (g/t) Tonnes Grade (g/t) Ounces Au---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cass 1.00 1,919,518 2.43 150,228 Kim (Main) 1.50 937,575 3.15 95,082---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total 2,857,093 2.66 245,311 A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify any of the historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined by NI 43-101; consequently, they should not be relied upon. The Company is not treating the historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves as defined by NI 43-101. Cass Zone The Cass Zone is located approximately 20 kilometres southwest of Colomac, hosted within a northeast trending gabbro sill. Mineralization is characterized by a stockwork of quartz-carbonate veins with minor pyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite. In excess of 13,500 metres of historic drilling into the zone has defined mineralization over a strike length of 360 metres and to a depth of 210 metres. Royal Oak intended to place the Cass Zone into production and process the ore at the Colomac Mill, but the company closed the Colomac operation before production from the Cass Zone began. Select drill intercepts from the Cass Zone are reported in Table 1 below. These are historical in nature and Nighthawk has not independently verified the results; consequently, these results should not be relied upon. Table 2. Historical Drill Intercepts from the Cass Zone---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hole ID From (m) To (m) Length (i) (m) Au g/t---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C87-23 112.10 176.50 64.40 4.08---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C87-25 170.60 223.90 53.30 4.17---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C87-35 105.35 186.90 81.55 4.50---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C95-05 122.00 170.00 48.00 4.15---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C95-06 153.00 205.00 52.00 5.10---------------------------------------------------------------------------- C95 .09 82.00 119.00 37.00 4.83---------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) Lengths are reported as core lengths. True widths are unknown at this time. Kim Main Zone The Kim Main Zone, located approximately 15 kilometres southwest of Nighthawk's past producing Colomac Gold Mine, lies within a sequence of northerly striking, steeply dipping, mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks. Mineralization is hosted by intercalated, massive and pillowed mafic volcanics and has been traced over a strike length of 650 metres and to depths of up to 150 metres vertically. Near surface mineralization is offset by a north-south trending, 45 degree late reverse fault, but historical drilling is reported to have intersected mineralization below the fault and the zone remains open at depth. Over 18,000 metres of historic drilling is documented for the Kim Main Zone. 19th Hole Zone and Albatross Zone Two occurrences, the 19th Hole Zone, located 300 metres to the southwest of the Cass Zone, and the Albatross Zone, located 500 metres further to the southwest, appear to be extensions of the Cass Zone. Both the Albatross Zone and the 19th Hole Zone are defined by an area of extensive quartz-carbonate veining in gabbro with associated pyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite identical to that of the Cass Zone. 19th Hole Zone Historic surface trench samples collected from the 19th Hole showing assayed 15.9 g/t gold and 11.58 g/t gold over widths greater than 1 metre. Two other samples had values of 5.5 g/t gold over similar widths. Albatross Zone The Albatross occurrence is located entirely within Nighthawk ground and appears to represent a continuance of the Cass Deposit mineralization. Historical channel samples from a trench across the zone returned assay results up to 9.7 g/t gold over 1 metre. 1 Archibald, D.L., and Kulas, J. P., 1995.

maybe it's a saying that captures your purpose or your mission. or maybe it's a string of words, a collection of passages or even a poem that inspires your actions. we asked several clinicians to describe their mottos. perhaps their tenets will stir you to take the time to think about the words you'd like to live by. urban balance, llc: in life, we are all dealt a different hand of hardships and blessings. we each have a unique life experience that will help us learn, grow and develop emotionally, relationally and spiritually. we must each honor our personal life history to gain awareness of how our earlier experiences have shaped and molded us into who we are today. we have the choice to let go of old belief systems and negative thinking patterns that constrain us and create our own ceilings. we have the power to attract positivity in our lives by silencing our inner critic and practicing gratitude. in my practice and in my own life experiences, i have come to believe that some of the greatest life challenges bring about gifts such as increased consciousness, awareness, depth, perspective, empathy, compassion, resiliency, wisdom, strength, capability, tolerance, and serenity. our life outcome all depends on how we view the hand we are dealt. if we focus on the negative, on our egos, or on the hardships of the past we will not thrive and prosper. if we view our hardships as opportunities for growth and learning and empower ourselves to move forward in life in a way that is compassionate and loving to ourselves and others, we will succeed personally and professionally. <mark>john duffy</mark>, ph.d, a clinical psychologist and author of the book the available parent: radical optimism for raising teens and tweens: for myself, i try to follow a couple of guides. first, i try to follow \"the four agreements\" as delineated by don <mark>miguel ruiz</mark> in his book of the same name. the very basic agreements read: be impeccable with your word. don't make assumptions. don't take anything personally. always do your best. i've distilled these down to two: be impeccable with your word, and always do your best. if i achieve these every day, i believe i've led a good life. i also try to keep the serenity prayer in mind every day: grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference. i calm myself with these thoughts whenever i get anxious. deborah serani, psy.d, a clinical psychologist and author of depression: i love using proverbs and quotes to help guide me in life. i weave them into my clinical practice with people i work with too. one of my favorites for when life seems tough is the japanese proverb: \"fall down seven times, get up eight.\" it helps me realize that no matter how many times i fall, i have the power to rise again. so this wonderful, wise proverb helps me summon adhd executive functions workbook: [my motto is] good deeds tend to be rewarded. i don't believe in karma, but i do believe in playing the odds. good deeds build good will, so the more people who have positive thoughts about you, the more likely it is that good opportunities will come your way. being diligent about handling your responsibilities and being generous about helping others out builds fans who are happy to reward good performance and return the favor. i've found that some \"sure bet\" opportunities didn't work out as expected but also that interesting opportunities came out of the blue, so you can't be too mercenary about it or expect a direct reward for every good deed. rather, it's a general mindset that doing enough of the right things will bring enough of what you want. beyond the obvious aspects of you scratch my back, i'll scratch yours, there is also the more subtle aspect that people like to associate with others who they see as capable, generous, and positive. emily campbell, lcpc, ceap, a psychotherapist at urban balance, llc: [my motto is] love god, love people. it comes from jesus' words that the greatest commandments are to \"love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself.\" it means focusing first on loving god, and allowing his love to flow through us to others, treating them as we would wish to be treated. our relationships with god and other people comprise our life; everything else is just the extras. alison thayer, lcpc, ceap, a psychotherapist at urban balance, llc: [my motto is] everything will be ok in the end. if it's not ok, it's not the end. (i believe the author is considered unknown .) i use this motto to highlight the significance of the journey and the lessons we experience in life. so often, we get caught up in not having what we want when we want it. this is particularly valuable to perfectionists, or \"type a\" personalities who are driven and expect to get immediate results. these individuals can really struggle when the results are not exactly as they anticipated, and they may view the alternative result as a failure (also known as all-or-none thinking). margarita tartakovsky, m.s. is an associate editor at psych central and blogs regularly about eating and self-image issues on her own blog, weightless. apa reference tartakovsky, m.

Advertisement The 35-day partial shutdown over the president's demand for billions of dollars to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was, in the end, futile. Facing defections within his own party, sagging poll numbers and public criticism for interrupted services, the self-proclaimed master dealmaker accepted an agreement that he had previously spurned and set an ignominious record that will remain part of his legacy. Days after Trump marked the midpoint of his term, the shutdown highlighted the disquieting side effects of his unconventional governing style and the trials that lie ahead for him in dealing with emboldened Democrats. The folly of the effort was readily apparent inside the White House, where aides had warned Trump even before the shutdown began that there was no avenue to success in the showdown with Capitol Hill. Democrats ran for office on preventing Trump from building the wall--and it's hardly a popular idea even among Republican lawmakers. Advisers watched in shock as Trump declared in a December meeting with lawmakers that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government. And when he ultimately did just that, they feared the messaging war had already been lost. \"He was playing double-A ball against major leaguers,\" said former Republican Rep. <mark>Tom Davis</mark> of Virginia, who once headed the House GOP's campaign arm. By backing himself into the shutdown with no way out, <mark>Davis</mark> said, Trump displayed a lack of discipline from the start. The strategic deficit was only magnified by what allies saw as tactical errors. Trump spent the holidays tweeting from the White House rather than making public appearances to showcase his readiness to negotiate. He didn't deliver a public address or visit the border to make his case until weeks had already gone by. Perhaps most crucially, he underestimated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the unity of congressional Democrats, thinking the Californian would be more amenable to a deal on the wall once she won the speakership. Trump's message zigzagged sometimes by the hour. He maintained he was proud of shutting down the government and then tried to pin the blame on Democrats. One moment he signaled he was ready to concede the wall in favor of other barriers on the border, and the next he tweeted he was fighting for the wall as strongly as ever. It was emblematic of the dysfunctional White House culture he has fostered and the challenges that have been manifest on decisions big and small for two years. By the end of the shutdown, West Wing aides and outside allies of the president began to look at the seminal promise of Trump's 2016 campaign as an immense--and unachievable--burden on his presidency. It was complaints that Trump appeared to be passing up his last, best opportunity to make good on his build-the-wall pledge that led Trump into the shutdown to begin with. Conservative commentators and House Freedom Caucus members fired off warnings that Trump's base would sour on him if he didn't use the last days of unified GOP control of Washington last year to try to get money for the barrier. But in his quest to appease his base, the president tarnished his standing with the American public. Overall, 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job performance in a survey released this week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's down from 42 percent a month earlier and nears the lowest mark of his two-year presidency. \"Hopefully now the president has learned his lesson,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a gloating press conference with Pelosi. The impasse was an early test for Pelosi after her return to the speakership, one that she appeared to pass handily. Democrats remained unified against White House efforts to divide the caucus, and they head into the next round of debate over border security funding determined to make good on their own 2018 promises to block Trump's wall. As White House aides suggested that the shutdown had brought Democrats to embrace border \"barriers,\" Pelosi make clear her party remained resolved against the wall. \"Have I not been clear?\" she said. \"No, I have been very clear.\" Trump, characteristically, refused to concede that he'd conceded. Instead, he insisted he hadn't caved to Democrats, and he threatened yet another shutdown even while bemoaning the last one's impact on Americans. \"This was in no way a concession,\" Trump tweeted late Friday. \"It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it's off to the races!\" ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE: Zeke Miller has covered the White House and politics in Washington since 2011.
