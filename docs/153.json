could they have been members of groups hostile to the united states? could they have planted bugs, disabled weapons or in any other (ways) jeopardized security of the president or our country?\" asked maine's <mark>susan collins</mark>, the ranking republican on the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee. that account was disputed by u.s. secret service spokesman ed donovan, who said the exact number of women was still under investigation. \"sen. <mark>susan collins</mark>, in a conversation with the secret service, was told that 21 u.s. personnel are involved in the investigation, and she evidently misconstrued that to mean that 21 prostitutes were involved,\" a source familiar with the investigation said. <mark>collins</mark>' office disagreed with that account, saying, \"there was no misunderstanding .\" \"the whole behavior is so incredibly dangerous and risky particularly for those who are charged with the solemn obligation of protecting the president of our country,\" <mark>collins</mark> told cnn. later, kevin kelley, a spokesman for <mark>collins</mark>, said the number is not the issue. \"it's outrageous that the department is arguing about the number when, clearly, this incident never should have happened in the first place,\" kelley said. the secret service agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, and all have been interviewed at least once, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said monday. their security clearances have been pulled while the investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared, the officials said. the agents were offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a u.s. official. some of the agents and military personnel maintain that they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. \"even if they weren't (prostitutes), it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive,\" rep. <mark>peter king</mark>, r-new york, the chairman of the house homeland security committee, said on cnn's \"piers morgan tonight .\" house oversight committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r-california, said the agents should take the polygraph tests. \"for these individuals, if they want to have any career at all, they have to decide on telling the entire truth and seeing whether they have something going forward .\" issa said his level of confidence in <mark>sullivan</mark> is \"high .\" while soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, displaying conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct \"prejudicial to good order and discipline .\" comments the views expressed are not those of clickorlando.com, wkmg or its affiliated companies. this is a community moderated forum (please note the \"flag' button). by posting your comments you agree to accept our terms of service", "articleID": "2012041816_00092698_W", "names": {"Susan Collins": ["Q22279", "Q7647692"]}}, {"date": "2012-04-19", "url": "http://iol.co.za/news/world/no-charges-in-death-of-girl-after-fight-1.1279663", "content": "april 19 2012 at 09:55 am by gillian flaccus ap a photo of joanna ramos, 10, with a note, is left at a memorial outside willard elementary school in long beach, calif. on monday feb. 27, 2012. ramos, who died after a fight with an 11-year-old in an alley near their elementary school underwent emergency surgery for a blood clot on her brain before her death, her sister said monday. (ap photo/nick ut) prosecutors declined to file charges on wednesday against an 11-year-old girl who fought with a 10-year-old schoolmate hours before the younger girl died. the death of joanna ramos came after a \"fight between two children that ended with unintended and tragic results,\" but no crime was committed, police said in a statement. police referred all inquiries to the district attorney's office. district attorney spokeswoman sandi gibbons said her office could not comment on the decision because the case involved a juvenile. joanna was pronounced dead on february 24, about six hours after she tussled with another girl in an alley near her california school when classes ended. her mother, <mark>cecilia villanueva</mark>, said officials met with the family wednesday morning, but she still knows few details about the fight and chose not to ask because it was too painful. \"there's nothing they can do that's going to bring my daughter back, nothing. there's nothing i can do,\" she said, choking back tears. <mark>villanueva</mark> said she felt for the other girl. \"her life is not the same anymore. i'm not angry because it could have happened to the girl instead of to joanna,\" she said. the name of the other girl has not been made public. joanna's family previously told the associated press that she underwent emergency surgery for a blood clot on her brain and was resuscitated several times before she died. joanna's older sister, vanessa urbina, said wednesday she was disappointed about the decision. the family knows little more about what prompted the fight than they did when it happened nearly two months ago, she said. \"there's nothing we can do, but i want charges on her,\" said urbina, 17. \"she killed my sister. she didn't mean to kill her, but she meant to hurt her .\" the fight near willard elementary school didn't appear to be especially violent, no weapons were used, and neither girl was knocked to the ground, police have said. joanna had a bloody nose when she returned to her after-school program, according to witnesses, and had to be picked up early by a relative because she didn't feel well. by the time joanna got home, she was complaining of a headache and vomiting. before she passed out on the family's couch, she told her mother an 11-year-old girl had punched her in the head but refused to say more, <mark>villanueva</mark> previously told the ap. comment guidelines. login and register, if you haven' t already .? copyright 1999 -

and not just old, black & white classics - you need look no further than the new 4-disc set, <mark>david lean</mark> directs noel coward [criterion]. these are not significant studio money-earners, true; one of the titles is a beloved and iconic classic, another might be termed a minor classic of sorts, and the others are respected films that have been relatively out of view. what criterion has done and repeatedly does - besides the not-insubstantial act of simply making these titles readily available - is restore these films beyond measure, both picture and sound. which in the case of a stunning film like \"brief encounter\" is a true gift. criterion also crams their releases with bonus features; not the sort that you can find here or there, but things which people who love the film (s) in question will actually be eager to watch. they add a booklet of pertinent essays, too. criterion releases are, typically, somewhat more expensive than the plain variety reissue (with or without mastering, with or without bonuses). but the overall packages present true explorations of the film, not just simply a copy of the movie. <mark>lean</mark> - he of the sweeping \"bridge on the river kwai,\" \"lawrence of arabia,\" and \"doctor zhivago\" - does not necessarily seem an obvious match for the enfant terrible of the haymarket. but the pairing made perfect sense at the time. <mark>lean</mark> was already an expert editor, with credits including the film adaptations of shaw's major barbara. when coward was signed to direct his first film in 1942, he enlisted <mark>lean</mark> to co-direct. \"in which we serve,\" the earliest title in this collection, was a full-throttle patriotic paean to the british war effort, with coward starring, writing, producing, composing, and who knows what else. and, yes, co-directing with <mark>lean</mark>. coward based his script on a real-life event, the 1941 sinking of the hms kelly during the battle of crete. coward's friend lord louis mountbatten was in command; noel plays a fictionalized version of his friend, here called captain kinross. the film really does do its job, and does it well. the cast includes <mark>john mills</mark>, bernard miles, next up was \"this happy breed,\" in 1944. not quite so much a coward film as the first; while it was based on his 1942 play and he served as producer and co-composer, he was neither before the camera nor behind it. (coward did star in the original play .) this was a domestic tale of a british family between the wars. <mark>robert newton</mark> and celia johnson star, with especially watchable turns from kay walsh (<mark>lean</mark>), stanley holloway, and <mark>john mills</mark>. the latter had appeared in the stage version, as well as in \"in which we serve .\" he went on to star for <mark>lean</mark> in \"great expectations\" and \"ryan's daughter,\" receiving an oscar for his performance in the latter. during the making of these first two films, coward was raking in the pounds and dollars from his longest-running comedy success, blithe spirit. the 1941 play was simultaneously produced in london (where it opened at the piccadilly in july, for 1,997 performances) and new york (at the morosco in november, for 657). coward appeared in neither, presumably eschewing london so that he could recreate his direction in new york. he did, though, play the role in the u.k. tour which opened just after the 1942 release of \"in which we serve .\" blithe spirit brought enormous cheer to war-weary audiences, with the coward stand-in originated by cecil parker in london and rex harrison took the lead, supported by kay hammond (elvira) and margaret rutherford (madame arcati) from the west end company, along with constance cummings as ruth. <mark>david lean</mark>'s film of \"blithe spirit\" - produced by coward - remains a delightfully whimsical joy. the prize of the set, naturally enough, is \"brief encounter .\" here we have celia johnson (once again) and trevor howard in that railway station refreshment room, as rachmaninoff's second piano concerto swells on the soundtrack. \"brief encounter\" was derived from still life, one of the short plays that encompassed coward's 1936 tour-de-force tonight at 8:30. (these were ten one-acts - nine in new york - which were performed by coward and co-star gertrude lawrence over the course of three evenings; given coward's numerous professional activities, the runs were limited .) still life was significantly transformed by <mark>lean</mark> to become \"brief encounter\" ; this is a coward/lean collaboration, and an altogether magical one. which is to say that <mark>lean</mark> - before he approached that series of sweeping classics typified by \"lawrence of arabia\" - was indeed well suited to coward. related articles: 12 apr 2012--once upon a tune: a beloved film score is reinvented for broadway once upon a tune: a beloved film score is reinvented for broadway photo exclusive: backstage at broadway's once and the \"letterman\" set with j. michael zygo photo exclusive: backstage at broadway's once and the \"letterman\" set with j. michael zygo photo exclusive: behind the scenes on \"the today show\" set with broadway's photo exclusive: backstage at broadway's once and the \"letterman\" set with j. michael zygo old jews telling jokes 4000 miles man and superman magic/bird the best man priscilla...regrets the big meal new york pops gala seminar chicago gore vidal's the best man how to succeed...mamma mia! mary poppins rock of ages sister act the dvd shelf: \"brief encounter,\" \"vanya on 42nd street,\" \"a night to remember,\" fred astaire, \"car 54\" drew overcash's by your side concert, with richard h. blake, nick cartell, rebecca larkin, offered april 22 suddenly, three more: songwriter alan menken scores a trio of broadway shows steamy streetcar revival, with blair underwood and nicole ari parker, opens on broadway", "articleID": "2012042204_00044593_W", "names": {"David Lean": ["Q1175138", "Q16107019"], "John Mills": ["Q16201718", "Q17402961", "Q19520598", "Q24257027", "Q27915240", "Q48810303", "Q54901208", "Q58209206", "Q6248833"], "Robert Newton": ["Q39190184", "Q56084820", "Q7348021"]}}, {"date": "2012-04-22", "url": "http://detroitnews.com/article/20120422/NATION/204220316/1020/rss09", "content": "people walk by a mural of venezuela's president <mark>hugo chavez</mark> in caracas, venezuela on friday. (ap photo/ariana cubillos) caracas, venezuela - venezuelan president <mark>hugo chavez</mark> has been out of sight for a week, speaking only through twitter messages and written statements while undergoing cancer treatment in cuba. the lack of any appearances on television has venezuelans wondering about what his unusual silence might say about his struggle with cancer, and whether <mark>chavez</mark> may be coping with a particularly tough phase of radiation therapy. more than 30 messages have appeared on <mark>chavez</mark>'s twitter account since he left for cuba on april 14. he has cheered on supporters with slogans such as \"let's continue building socialism!\" in others, he has praised his military commanders, announced funding for local governments and vowed to survive and win re-election in october. but he has seldom mentioned his cancer treatment. national assembly president diosdado cabello reiterated on friday that <mark>chavez</mark> is expected to return to venezuela soon. \"god willing, next week he'll be here again with us once he has finished the treatment,\" cabello said in a televised speech. he insisted that even when <mark>chavez</mark> is away in cuba, \"he leads just the same as if he were here in venezuela .\" \"the commander's presence here isn't necessary, because just the same he's the commander of the revolution,\" cabello said. but even some of <mark>chavez</mark>'s supporters have been saying recently that they wonder what's going on with his health. \"it makes me sad, but my comandante must not be as well as they say,\" said guillermo suarez, a street vendor selling sunglasses. \"it's already been many days that we haven't seen him, heard him .\" <mark>chavez</mark>, who has been president since 1999, has long been a constant presence on venezuelan television, often addressing the nation for several hours most days in addition to his marathon sunday program \"hello, president .\" but recently there have been no episodes of \"hello, president,\" and <mark>chavez</mark> said he expected his final rounds of radiation therapy, which began last month, to be rough. <mark>chavez</mark> has not discussed details of the radiation treatments, saying they have diminished his strength but have been going well. last weekend, he decided not to attend the summit of the americas in colombia, the sort of high-profile international event where he would previously have taken center stage. foreign minister nicolas maduro announced the decision, saying <mark>chavez</mark> was skipping the summit on the advice of his doctors. <mark>chavez</mark> began radiation treatment in cuba in late march after undergoing an operation in february that removed a second tumor from his pelvic region. the first was taken out last june. he has kept secret some details of his illness, including the type of cancer and the precise location of the tumors. <mark>chavez</mark> also was away in havana regularly last year while undergoing chemotherapy after the initial surgery. during previous trips to cuba, <mark>chavez</mark> periodically appeared on television, either in phone calls or appearances with his aides or daughters, and gave the appearance of continuing to work and keeping abreast of affairs at home. before his latest trip to cuba, <mark>chavez</mark> said he planned to stay away longer to allow for his last two rounds of radiation treatment. he urged his supporters to remain united and said an \"anti-coup command\" was being formed within his political movement to focus on maintaining stability and countering any possible attempt to destabilize his government. in the past week, his twitter messages have been read aloud by his cabinet ministers at televised events. at one event friday, <mark>chavez</mark>'s supporters responded with shouts of \"onward, comandante!\" in several twitter messages saturday, <mark>chavez</mark> urged his party to mobilize \"toward the big victory of oct. 7\" in the election. another said: \"comrades you make me happy! let's keep fighting very hard to defeat the bourgeoisie! a downpour is falling over havana, and i'm with you!\" <mark>chavez</mark>'s online messages aim to \"make it appear that the president is active, that the president is in control of what's going on in venezuela,\" said jose vicente carrasquero, a political science professor at venezuela's simon bolivar university. carrasquero, a government critic, said that while <mark>chavez</mark> has been coping with illness, long-standing problems such as rampant crime, inflation and sporadic shortages of some food items are going unresolved. without <mark>chavez</mark> on the air, state television has instead shown a salsa concert, documentaries and a mass. such programs and newscasts are interspersed with a short segment showing a healthy <mark>chavez</mark> embracing children in slow motion against a background of folk music. columnist fausto maso wrote in the newspaper el nacional that \"never has the uncertainty been greater in venezuela .\" pro-chavez lawmaker dario vivas dismissed concerns about <mark>chavez</mark> keeping a lower profile, saying the president remains fully in charge and is regaining his health. albuquerque, n.m. - a new mexico teacher asked a 13-year-old girl to stop talking with her friend and move to another seat. the girl refused. the

<mark>steve james</mark> (reuters) - u.s. steel corp's (x) flat-rolled business could decline in the second quarter and the european economy is still a challenge, the company said on tuesday in a disappointing outlook that sent its stock down. but chairman and chief executive officer john surma later painted a rosier picture, telling wall street analysts that order rates have picked up in the last month as demand for steel improves in most end-markets except construction. \"our order rates in the last month or so have been better than the previous two months,\" surma said on a conference call. \"so demand...has been steady .\" the north american market...despite the fact that the economic recovery has been very choppy...is still a pretty good market. the biggest missing link there is in construction. \"surma said u.s. steel was benefiting from strong demand from oil and gas drillers for tubular steel, and also from detroit where auto production is on the upswing .\" on the overall automotive market for us in north america we've been doing very well, \"he said .\" (but) while our markets are gradually improving, the economic recovery is certainly not complete. \"earlier, the steelmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, saying it shipped more steel in the january-march period than in any quarter in more than three years. but it also gave a gloomy outlook for the second quarter. results for the flat-rolled steel segment are expected to decrease due primarily to higher maintenance costs, surma said in the company's earnings statement. costs were expected to increase by about $50 million from the first quarter, for scheduled blast furnace and other maintenance projects. that will reduce the amount of steel the company produces .\" while the economic conditions in europe remain challenging, \"second-quarter results from the european business segment are expected to return a positive income from operations, u.s. steel said. the tubular segment, which makes steel for gas and oil pipes, is expected to have similar results to the first quarter. the company's stock fell as much as 4 percent during the morning but recovered somewhat to close down 2 percent at $27.65 on the new york stock exchange .\" the stock is down on a more muted second-quarter outlook. they are guiding to a flat quarter, \"said analyst kuni chen of crt capital group. he pointed out that steel prices, which rose earlier this year, have since stalled in recent weeks .\" it's a bit of a disappointment as people were expecting positive pricing and momentum to follow into the second quarter. \"michelle applebaum of steel market intelligence in chicago said steel prices had fallen back as a result of chinese steel production and export increases in march .\" when china produces more steel, the world has too much, \"she said. u.s. steel posted a net loss of $219 million, or $1.52 per share, compared with a net loss of $86 million, or 60 cents a share, in the same quarter of 2011. but adjusted for items, including a $399 million loss on the sale of its serbian operations, it showed a profit of 67 cents per share, which beat analyst expectations. sales rose to $5.2 billion from $4.8 billion in the 2011 quarter on higher prices and shipments, the pittsburgh-based company said. analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 45 cents a share and revenue of $4.95 billion, according to thomson reuters i/b/e / s. u.s. steel said first-quarter prices increased by $23 per ton to $764 per ton due to higher average realized prices on both spot and
