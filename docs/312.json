essential patent \"has the potential to cause substantial harm to u.s. competition, consumers and innovation,\" the ftc wrote in a june 6 filing with the agency. it said companies could be coerced into unreasonable licensing fees in a practice known as a \"patent holdup.\" motorola mobility says it fulfilled its obligation to make a reasonable royalty offer and apple refuses to negotiate. \"unwilling licensee'\" apple and others--without analyzing the facts of this case--point to the problem of \"hold up,'\" motorola mobility told the commission in a july 16 filing. \"but they ignore the counter problem of\" hold out'--an unwilling licensee being rewarded for its intransigence in a manner that will deprive patent owners of value and create disincentives for innovative companies from participating in standards setting. \"the case represents one battle in a broader global legal war over patents, including more than a dozen complaints at the itc over the past two years, as companies vie for increased shares of a smartphone market that grew 62 percent to $219 billion last year. apple, in one of the high-profile cases, is awaiting a california jury's verdict in a separate dispute claiming that samsung's android phones copied patented iphone features. in south korea today, the seoul central district court ruled that apple and samsung infringed each other's patents and told them both to stop selling some versions of their products in that country. google, based in mountain view, california, is counting on motorola mobility's long history with mobile phones--and its trove of 17,000 patents--to force apple into a settlement of the itc case that could also encompass handset makers using google's android operating system, including samsung electronics co. and htc corp. motorola mobility approached apple in 2007 about a patent license, demanding a royalty of 2.25 percent of the price of apple products. motorola mobility has said that's the standard offer it makes, and expects the figure to change during negotiations. apple and microsoft corp., which has its own legal fights with motorola mobility, said the demand was unreasonable. presidential review president barack obama could review a commission decision and reject any import ban on public policy grounds. in the past, patent owners have lost efforts to block imports for health - related products, for devices that reduced gasoline consumption during the 1970s oil crisis, and when the government was in the midst of trade negotiations. itc judge thomas pender, who presided over the trial, recommended that the agency issue an import ban on any product found to infringe the motorola mobility patents. he said apple should pay the 2.25 percent royalty rate during the 60-day presidential review period.\" extreme solution' qualcomm inc., which makes and designs chips for mobile phones and gets more than one-third of its revenue from licensing, said the ftc's suggestion for limiting import bans based on standard-essential patents is \"an extreme solution in search of a problem.\" the commission could say that an import ban isn't in the public interest, or delay imposing a ban to give apple and motorola mobility time to resolve their differences or to have other courts hear their cases, said david long, a patent lawyer with dow lohnes in washington. \"their challenge would be to create what relief they can if there is a violation,\" long said. \"it's up to congress to establish whether standard-essential patents are welcome at the itc, and congress hasn't done that.\" the case is in the matter of certain wireless communication devices, portable music data, processing data devices, computers and components thereof, 337-745, u.s. international trade commission (washington). apple inc. is counting on the popularity of its devices and political pressure to thwart efforts by google inc.'s motorola mobility to block imports of the iphone and ipad."}, {"articleID": "2019010818_00559664_W", "names": {"Marc Rubio": ["Q57610577", "Q5995382"]}, "date": "2019-01-08", "url": "https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/01/08/instead-ending-shutdown-senators-plan-encourage-punishment-israel-boycotts?cd-origin=rss", "content": "In the middle of a government shutdown, the Senate leadership's first order of business in the 116th Congress is not legislation to reopen the government. Instead, and incredibly, the Senate is again trying to slip a measure intended to suppress protected political expression past public scrutiny. The bill is the \"Combatting BDS Act,\" which would express federal approval of state laws that place restrictions on boycotts of Israel and its settlements, as part of an effort to weaken the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. The bill is included in S. 1, which the Senate plans to vote on this week. On Monday, the ACLU sent a letter to senators expressing opposition to the bill. To their credit, Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md .), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md .), and Bernie Sanders (D-Vt .) have urged the Senate not to consider any bills, other than those that would reopen the government, until the shutdown ends. We agree. The Combatting BDS Act represents yet another covert attempt by the Senate to enact legislation that would burden fundamental free expression rights without proper consideration on the heels of a failed attempt last month to pass a different law criminalizing boycotts of Israel. But moreover, voting on it now, amid a partial government shutdown, would be, as Sen. Cardin noted, \"a fundamental failure to govern.\" The Combating BDS Act would attempt to give legal cover to states that enact laws penalizing businesses and individuals who participate in boycott activities against Israel and Israeli-controlled territories. The Combating BDS Act would attempt to give legal cover to states that enact laws penalizing businesses and individuals who participate in boycott activities against Israel and Israeli-controlled territories. These state laws, dozens of which exist in many different forms, generally compel state contractors and any entity in which the state invests--for example, through a state-run pension, retirement, or endowment fund--to sign oaths promising not to boycott Israel as a requirement of maintaining their relationship with the state. However, as courts found in the McCarthy era, the government can't fire its employees or contractors just because they refuse to sign an oath promising not to engage in disfavored expression or association. And two federal courts have already held state requirements to swear not to participate in boycotts of Israel be unconstitutional. While we take no position on Israel boycotts, the BDS movement or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we do maintain that states should not be sanctioning businesses on the basis of First Amendment-protected expression and association. We have consistently--and successfully--argued this position in situations where government entities have threatened to boycott a company based upon its constitutionally protected speech and associational choices. This is especially true where the ideological position has no connection whatsoever with the business relationship at stake. Math teachers in Kansas and newspapers in Arkansas should not have to disavow participation in protected expression and association in order to do their jobs or engage in business relationships with the state. With the Combatting BDS Act, Congress would be approving state laws imposing such unconstitutional requirements. On Monday, Sen. <mark>Marc Rubio</mark> (R-Fla .), the lead sponsor of the bill, tweeted: This is a lie. My bill doesn't punish any political activity. It protects the right of local & state govts that decide to no longer do business with those who boycott #Israel. So boycotting #Israel is a constitutional right, but boycotting those participating in #BDS isn't? https: //t.co/kY9MSmBkkh--Marco Rubio (@ marcorubio) January 7, 2019 However, as we responded, the government, under the Constitution, does not have the right to punish people for their views. The First Amendment protects the people, not the government. Even setting aside our fundamental disagreement about the wisdom of the Combatting BDS Act, it is abundantly clear that the Senate should not be considering this legislation, or any other legislation, until it fulfills its first duty: maintaining a functioning government. The Senate should vote first to open the government and alleviate the pain of this interminable shutdown that disrupts people's lives and livelihoods every second that it continues."}, {"articleID": "2013050703_00020633_W", "names": {"David Welch": ["Q16193927", "Q27913581", "Q42174943", "Q5240945", "Q5240946", "Q5240947"], "Carmen Gonzalez": ["Q5043478", "Q9697469"]}, "date": "2013-05-06", "url": "http://www.sys-con.com/node/2646233", "content": "May 6, 2013 / PRNewswire /--Stone Energy Corporation (NYSE: SGY) today announced financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2013. Some of the highlights include: Two deep water drilling rig contracts were secured for the Stone operated projects in the proximity of its Pompano platform. The Diamond Ocean Victory is scheduled to drill the Amethyst exploration prospect starting in September 2013 and an ENSCO 8500 series rig is anticipated to commence drilling the Cardona and Cardona South development wells starting in the first quarter of 2014. Production volumes slightly exceeded the upper end of first quarter guidance. In Appalachia, volumes have been substantially restored from the third party pipeline interruptions which affected production from January through April 2013. Stone Energy Corporation was awarded the prestigious Safety in Seas Award from the National Ocean Industries Association. Stone Energy was recognized for innovative safety leadership in pioneering a new decommissioning method which resulted in a four-fold increase in the volume of work with zero OSHA recordable incidents. Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer <mark>David Welch</mark> stated, \"We have taken a significant step in our deep water efforts by securing the Diamond Ocean Victory rig and the ENSCO 8500 series rig. The rigs will be used to drill the Amethyst exploration prospect and the Cardona and Cardona South development wells. If successful, these wells will be produced through the Stone-operated Pompano deep water platform, with Cardona and Cardona South production projected for late 2014 and Amethyst production projected for 2015. In addition to our Stone-operated deep water program, we plan to accelerate our participation in non-operated deep water wells with 5-7 exploration prospects being drilled in 2013 and 2014. In our liquids rich Deep Gas area, initial production from the third well at La Cantera is projected by June 2013 and is expected to increase gross field volumes to over 100 MMcfe per day (over 25 MMcfe per day net). In Appalachia, third party pipeline repairs around our Mary field have been made, allowing Marcellus net volumes to reach over 60 MMcfe per day again. Our conventional shelf drilling program for 2013 will start in May with several low risk development wells scheduled in the second and third quarters. Finally, with over $400 million credit facility and cash flow from operations, we are well positioned to fund our 2013 capital program.\" Financial Results For the first quarter of 2013, Stone reported net income of $0.82 per share, on oil and gas revenue of $232.9 million, compared to net income of $51.0 million, or $1.04 per share, on oil and gas revenue of $244.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. Discretionary cash flow totaled $159.1 million during the first quarter of 2013, as compared to $175.1 million during the first quarter of 2012. Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the accompanying financial statements for a reconciliation of discretionary cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash flow provided by operating activities. Daily production during the first quarter of 2013 averaged 40.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoe) per day (241 million cubic feet of gas equivalent (MMcfe) per day), compared with daily production of 45.0 MBoe (270 MMcfe) per day in the fourth quarter of 2012, and daily production of 41.0 MBoe (246 MMcfe) per day in the first quarter of 2012. First quarter of 2013 production was negatively impacted by third party pipeline interruptions in Appalachia. First quarter of 2013 production mix was 46% oil, 6% natural gas liquids (NGL), and 48% natural gas. Prices realized during the first quarter of 2013 averaged $42.49 per barrel of NGLs and $3.17 per Mcf of natural gas. Average realized prices for the first quarter of 2012 were $67.26 per barrel of NGLs and $2.41 per Mcf of natural gas. Effective hedging transactions increased the average realized price of natural gas by $0.38 per Mcf and increased the average realized price of oil by $2.72 per barrel in the first quarter of 2013. Effective hedging transactions increased the average realized price of natural gas by $0.48 per Mcf and decreased the average realized price of oil by $3.13 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012. Lease operating expenses during the first quarter of 2013 totaled $14.70 per Boe or $2.45 per Mcfe), compared to $11.93 per Boe or $1.99 per Mcfe), in the first quarter of 2012. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD & A) on oil and gas properties for the first quarter of 2013 totaled $20.65 per Boe or $3.44 per Mcfe), compared to $22.48 per Boe or $3.75 per Mcfe), in the first quarter of 2012. Salaries, general and administrative (SG & A) expenses for the first quarter of 2013 were $3.87 per Boe or $0.64 per Mcfe), compared to $3.68 per Boe or $0.61 per Mcfe), in the first quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures before capitalized SG & A and interest during the first quarter of 2013 were approximately $14.9 million of plugging and abandonment expenditures. Additionally, $6.6 million of SG & A expenses and $10.0 million of interest were capitalized during the first quarter of 2013. May 6, 2013 we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility. In addition, Stone had letters of credit totaling $379.0 million available for borrowing based on a borrowing base of $400 million. The borrowing base was reaffirmed at April 30, 2013. Operational Update Mississippi Canyon 26 - Amethyst (Deep Water). Stone has contracted the Diamond Ocean Victory deep water drilling rig for Stone's Amethyst oil exploration prospect at Mississippi Canyon 26. The deep water Amethyst exploration well is currently scheduled to spud late in the third quarter of 2013. Stone is the operator of the well and currently holds a 100% working interest, although expects to reduce its working interest in the prospect. The well is estimated to take four months to drill. Pompano Area - Cardona and Cardona South Prospects (Deep Water). Stone has contracted an ENSCO 8500 series dynamically positioned deep water drilling rig for Stone's Cardona oil development program at Mississippi Canyon 29. Drilling on the Cardona well is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2014 followed by the drilling of the Cardona South well. Stone plans to tie back both wells to the 100% owned Pompano platform with production projected for late 2014. Stone holds a 65% working interest in the Cardona wells and will be the operator. Each well is estimated to take three to four months to drill. Mississippi Canyon 983 - San Marcos (Deep Water). The deep water San Marcos exploration well is currently scheduled to spud late in the third quarter of 2013. Stone currently holds a 25% working interest in the prospect, which is operated by Apache. The well is estimated to take four months to drill. Mississippi Canyon 555 - Guadalupe (Deep Water). The deep water Guadalupe exploration well is currently scheduled to spud in late 2013 or early 2014. Stone currently holds a 40% working interest in the prospect, which is operated by Apache. The well is estimated to take four months to drill. Deep Water). The deep water Taggert exploration well is currently planned to spud in the second half of 2013. Stone currently holds a 23% working interest in the prospect, which is operated by LLOG. The well is estimated to take two months to drill. Deep Water). The deep water Phinisi exploration well is now projected to spud either in the fourth quarter of 2013 or the first half of 2014. Stone currently holds a 20% working interest in the prospect, which is operated by ENI. The well is estimated to take four months to drill. La Cantera (Deep Gas). The third well in the La Cantera field, the Broussard #1 ST #1, has been successfully drilled to 18,000 feet and is currently in completion operations with first production expected by June 2013. Combined with the first two wells, gross production from this field is projected at over 100 MMcfe per day (over 25 MMcfe per day net) when the third well commences production. Stone holds a 34.6% non-operated working interest in the field. Appalachian Basin (Marcellus Shale). Stone drilled 9 and completed 8 horizontal wells in the first quarter, and plans to drill and complete 28 to 32 horizontal wells in Appalachia in 2013. First quarter net volumes were negatively impacted by approximately 20 MMcfe per day as a result of third party pipeline failures and unscheduled gas processing plant outage. The Williams pipeline has been repaired and production is being restored, although there remain some pressure restrictions on volumes. Production is expected to increase as 11 recently completed wells in the Heather field (50% working interest) are brought on production. Appalachia is currently producing approximately 60 to 70 MMcfe per day, net. Conventional Shelf. The ENSCO 81 jack-up rig is expected to begin drilling on a three to four well conventional shelf/deep gas drilling program in May 2013. Stone expects to drill the Hammerlock oil prospect located on South Timbalier 100, followed by the Taildancer and Coracle oil prospects located on Ship Shoal 113. The Parker 50B inland barge rig spudded the Stone-operated Hyena prospect in the Clovelly field in April 30, 2013. Stone holds a 94% working interest in the Hammerlock prospect and a 100% working interest in Taildancer, Coracle, and Clovelly prospects. Other Information Stone Energy has planned a conference call for Tuesday, May 7, 2013 to discuss the operational and financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Anyone wishing to participate should visit our website at www.StoneEnergy.com for a live web cast or dial 1-877-228-3598 and request the \"Stone Energy Call.\" If you are unable to participate in the original conference call, a replay will be available immediately following the completion of the call on Stone Energy's website. The replay will be available for one month. In addition, as previously announced, Stone Energy will hold its 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on 10:00 a.m. Central Time at the Windsor Court Hotel, 300 Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. The Company proposes to elect ten directors, to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, to have a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers (say on pay), and to transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting. The close of business on March 25, 2013 has been fixed as the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive notification of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure we call \"discretionary cash flow.\" Management believes discretionary cash flow is a financial indicator of our company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and service debt. Management also believes this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow is useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Discretionary cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP. Please see the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\" for a reconciliation of discretionary cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking and are based upon Stone's current belief as to the outcome and timing of future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities that Stone plans, expects, believes, projects, estimates or anticipates will, should or may occur in the future, including future production of oil and gas, future capital expenditures and drilling of wells and future financial or operating results are forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil and gas, operating risks, liquidity risks, political and regulatory developments and legislation, including developments and legislation relating to our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Appalachia, and other risk factors and known trends and uncertainties as described in Stone's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, Stone's actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Estimates for Stone's future production volumes are based on assumptions of capital expenditure levels and the assumption that market demand and prices for oil and gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products. The production, transportation and marketing of oil and gas are subject to disruption due to transportation and processing availability, mechanical failure, human error, hurricanes and numerous other factors. Stone's estimates are based on certain other assumptions, such as well performance, which may vary significantly from those assumed. Delays experienced in well permitting could affect the timing of drilling and production. Lease operating expenses, which include major maintenance costs, vary in response to changes in prices of services and materials used in the operation of our properties and the amount of maintenance activity required. Estimates of DD & A rates can vary according to reserve additions, capital expenditures, future development costs, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that our future production volumes, lease operating expenses or DD & A rates will be as estimated. Stone Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana with additional offices in Houston and Morgantown, West Virginia. Our business strategy is to leverage cash flow generated from existing assets to maintain relatively stable GOM shelf production, profitably grow gas reserves and production in price-advantaged basins such as Appalachia and the Gulf Coast Basin, and profitably grow oil reserves and production in material impact areas such as the deep water GOM and onshore oil.

The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 101.1, up from 96.7 in July. It was the highest level for confidence since the index hit 102.6 last September. The gain reflected consumers' brighter views about current the economic situation and their expectations for the future. The percentage of those surveyed who saw business conditions as \"good\" increased from 27.3 percent to 30 percent. Those who viewed business conditions as \"bad\" remained virtually unchanged at 18.4 percent. Consumers who regarded jobs as \"plentiful\" increased from 23 percent to 26 percent, although those who felt jobs were \"hard to get\" also rose slightly from 22.1 percent to 23.4 percent. Economists said that the climb in confidence reflected stronger job gains seen in recent months, as well as strength in the stock market and home prices, which boost consumers' net worth. They expect the momentum in jobs to boost incomes and spur stronger consumer spending. That should help growth accelerate in the second half of this year, after four quarters of an anemic average growth rate of 1.2 percent. Many analysts believe gross domestic product will top 3 percent in the current quarter. \"Growth will be supported by consumer confidence and job growth,\" <mark>Jennifer Lee</mark>, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in reaction to the consumer confidence report.

Bernardo Silva scored City's consolation. City welcomed back Rodri to the starting XI and <mark>David Silva</mark> to the bench, but Ederson was out with injury. Benjamin Mendy was omitted from the matchday squad for tactical reasons. Liverpool took the lead through Fabinho, but City felt they should have been given a penalty at the other end for handball.

Democrats condemned what they saw as a clear effort to damage a political rival, now at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump. It was the latest revelation in an escalating controversy that has created a showdown between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, which has refused to turn over the formal complaint by a national security official or even describe its contents. Trump is defending himself against the intelligence official's complaint, asserting that it comes from a \"partisan whistleblower,\" though the president also says he doesn't know who had made it. The complaint was based on a series of events, one of which was a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a two people familiar with the matter. The people were not authorized to discuss the issue by name and were granted anonymity. In a tweet Saturday, Trump referred to \"a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had\" with Ukraine's leader. \"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong.\" Trump, in that call, urged Zelenskiy to probe the activities of potential Democratic rival Biden's son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company, according to one of the people, who was briefed on the call. Trump did not raise the issue of U.S. aid to Ukraine, indicating there was not an explicit quid pro quo, according to the person. In an interview with Ukrainian outlet Hromadske that was published Friday evening, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said his country was not interested in taking sides in U.S. politics, but that Zelenskiy had the right to keep the contents of his conversation with Trump secret. \"I know what the conversation was about and I do not think there was any pressure\" from Trump, Prystaiko was quoted as saying. \"There was a conversation, different conversation, leaders have the right to discuss any existing issues. This was a long and friendly conversation that touched on a lot of issues, sometimes requiring serious answers.\" Biden said that if the reports are true, \"then there is truly no bottom to President Trump's willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\" He said Trump should release the transcript of his July phone conversation with Zelenskiy \"so that the American people can judge for themselves.\" The U.S. government's intelligence inspector general has described the whistleblower's Aug. 12 complaint as \"serious\" and \"urgent.\" Trump dismissed it all Friday, insisting \"it's nothing.\" He scolded reporters for asking about it and said it was \"just another political hack job.\" \"I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,\" Trump said. \"At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\" Trump was asked whether he knew if the whistleblower's complaint centered on the July 25 call with Zelenskiy. \"I really don't know,\" Trump said. When questioned whether he had brought up Biden in the call, Trump said, \"It doesn't matter what I discussed.\" But then Trump urged the media \"to look into\" Biden's background with Ukraine. There has yet to be any evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son regarding Ukraine. Trump and Zelenskiy plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this coming week. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump pressed Zelenskiy about Biden. The standoff with Congress raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump's appointees are protecting the Republican president from oversight and, specifically, whether his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president. Democrats say the administration is legally required to give Congress access to the whistleblower's complaint, and Rep. Adam Schiff of California has said he will go to court in an effort to get it if necessary. The intelligence community's inspector general said the matter involves the \"most significant\" responsibilities of intelligence leadership. House Democrats also are fighting the administration for access to witnesses and documents in impeachment probes. In the whistleblower case, lawmakers are looking into whether Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to aid Trump's reelection effort by investigating the activities of Biden's son. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. He initially said, \"No, actually I didn't,\" but seconds later he said, \"Of course I did.\" Giuliani has spent months trying to drum up potentially damaging evidence about Biden's ties to Ukraine. He told CNN that Trump was unaware of his actions. \"I did what I did on my own,\" he said. \"I told him about it afterward. Still later, Giuliani tweeted,\" A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job. \"Democrats have contended that Trump, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, may have asked for foreign assistance in his upcoming reelection bid. Trump further stoked those concerns earlier this year in an interview when he suggested he would be open to receiving foreign help. The inspector general appeared before the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint. Schiff said Trump's attack on the whistleblower was disturbing and raised concerns that it would have a chilling effect on other potential exposers of wrongdoing. He also said it was\" deeply disturbing \"that the White House appeared to know more about the complaint than its intended recipient--Congress. The information\" deserves a thorough investigation, \"Schiff said.\" Come hell or high water, that's what we're going to do. \"Among the materials, Democrats have sought is a transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelenskiy. The call took place one day after Mueller's faltering testimony to Congress effectively ended the threat his probe posed to the White House. A readout of the call released from the Ukrainian government said Trump believed Kyiv could complete corruptions investigations that have hampered relations between the two nations but did not get into specifics. Sen. <mark>Chris Murphy</mark> of Connecticut, who in May called for a probe of Giuliani's effort in Ukraine, said in an interview on Friday it's\" outrageous \"the president has been sending his political operative to talk to Ukraine's new president. <mark>Murphy</mark> tweeted that during his own visit it was clear to him that Ukraine officials were\" worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani's demands. \"The senator tweeted that he told Zelenskiy during their August visit it was\" best to ignore requests from Trump's campaign operatives. He agreed. \"Letters to Congress from the inspector general make clear that Maguire consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It's unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said. Maguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by the House committee and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Maguire and the inspector general, <mark>Michael Atkinson</mark>, also are expected next week at the Senate Intelligence Committee. <mark>Atkinson</mark> wrote in letters that Schiff released that he and Maguire had hit an\" impasse \"over the acting director's decision not to share the complaint with Congress. <mark>Atkinson</mark> said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an\" urgent concern. \"And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director's jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional. <mark>Atkinson</mark> said he disagreed with that Justice Department view. The complaint\" not only falls under DNI's jurisdiction, \"<mark>Atkinson</mark> wrote,\" but relates to one of the most significant and important of DNI's responsibilities to the American people. \"___ Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Eric Tucker, Alan Fram and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington, D.C., and Matthew Bodner in Moscow contributed to this report.
