(photo: john flesher/ap) once a backwater in the world of oceanographic research, the gulf of mexico has suddenly become the site of a scientific gold rush, all because of the sharethe environmental disaster represents a once-in-a-generation research opportunity that has oceanographers salivating. there's big money - $500 million from bp alone - up for grabs. and for scientists who usually toil in near-obscurity, there's the prospect of lots of media attention. researchers are suddenly in demand, with more than 100 hired guns on the job. bp has signed up nearly 50 scientists to help defend it from legal action. the federal government has its paid experts, and so do attorneys suing bp. environmental activists have their own research vessels and scientists. at least 165 proposed studies are registered through a federal clearinghouse. some crucial supplies - such as boats - are hard to find. \"we've never had this many research vessels concentrated in the gulf at any one time - never,\" said corpus christi. \"it's been a flat-out crazy time .\" to try to bring order to what's going on, scientists studying the spill from around the country will gather in white house science office to talk about coordination and priorities. also in the next week or so, gulf states are expected to complete an agreement on how to hand out the $500 million in bp-pledged research money over the next decade. the gulf of mexico has gotten relatively little federal research support in the past. in the 20 years before the oil spill, the great lakes received more than $1 billion, while the chesapeake bay got just shy of half a billion. spending for the same time period on the much-larger gulf of mexico: $85 million. \"it's the hardest working of our ocean basins, but it's the most underfunded in terms of research monitoring and science,\" said <mark>ian macdonald</mark>. that's changing because of the worst offshore oil spill in u.s. history. hour after hour on a hot and windy september day, biologist eric hoffmayer bounced over choppy gulf waters in a fishing boat, hunting for whale sharks - one species among many that scientists are studying to measure how the spill has affected people and the environment. gulf coast research laboratory, is among the fortunate scholars who have snagged funding. he has had more luck landing money than whale sharks, at least on this outing, when none turned up. \"there's multiple sources of funding out there. you just have to know how to tap into it,\" hoffmayer said. two major types of research are taking place, and they often get confused by the public. one involves basic inquiries into questions such as where the oil has gone and what it means for the ecosystem, food web and public health. that is where bp has pledged to spend a half-billion dollars, with all findings to be made publicly available. the other type of research supports the federal government's natural resource damage assessment, or nrda, a part of the legal battle that eventually will determine how much money bp will pay for restoration. in the nrda process, both sides have hired experts and pledged them to secrecy. \"it is standard practice to ask such a litigation expert to maintain the confidentiality of communications with legal counsel,\" bp spokesman <mark>tom mueller</mark> wrote in an e-mail. likewise, the government may keep some data in this process secret, said national oceanic and atmospheric administration. noaa has 17 damage assessment teams working the spill, he said. under the 1990 oil spill law written after the exxon valdez disaster, both sides hire scientists, economists and attorneys and collect data in a legal process designed to \"make the public whole\" for loss of natural resources. billions of dollars are at stake with court fights likely to go on for years. but that's only a fraction of the research that's going on, scientists said. it's the general research money - including bp's half-billion - that most are seeking. the only stipulation from bp is \"the data is shared publicly when the results are in,\" <mark>mueller</mark> said. researchers and deans at several universities confirmed this. \"at one point i was sorely tempted to give the money back because frankly i didn't want the sea lab associated with bp money,\" said george crozier. but when he saw there were no strings, he accepted the money. national institutes of health, which then divided it among dozens of researchers. in florida, 233 proposals competed for $10 million in grants with only 27 getting funded. the gulf of mexico alliance, a consortium of state officials, is setting up a more permanent process for distributing the remaining $460 million from bp. \"i don't think $50 million a year is enough to study the problem as we know the scope of it,\" noaa's murawski said. environmental groups are getting into the act. greenpeace dispatched its 164-foot research ship arctic sunrise for a three-month tour of the gulf, where it is hosting university scientists for a variety of spill-related studies and collecting water samples. the funding scramble has created a geographical rift. scientists in the gulf region contend they should get most of the money because they know the area better and have been shortchanged in the past. those from elsewhere say grants should be awarded on the basis of researchers' credentials and the worthiness of their study proposals. gulf coast lab. many scientists in gulf states believe \"this is our time, this is our spill,\" he added. there's a sense of urgency behind the push for funding. ideally, scientists would have taken measurements before, during and after the spill to see how the ecosystem changed. their efforts were hampered for months by a shortage of vessels and poor access to the spill area as the government and bp focused on plugging the leak. now, the oil is becoming harder to find with each passing day. notify me with an email when other people comment on this article. worldshares lets you earn donations for your favorite nonprofit. earn up to 20 points now.", "articleID": "2010093014_00099154_W", "names": {"Ian Macdonald": ["Q16244231", "Q20877160", "Q21455018", "Q43093838", "Q56253516", "Q56945677", "Q59347362", "Q5982106", "Q5982109", "Q5982110", "Q5982140", "Q5982142"], "Tom Mueller": ["Q16957590", "Q47112851"]}}, {"date": "2010-09-30", "url": "http://ibtimes.com/articles/67401/20100930/w-house-keeps-pressure-on-china-over-yuan.htm", "content": "mattel recalls nearly 11 mln fisher-price toys to prevent choking, laceration hazards on thursday over the valuation of its currency but gave no clear sign whether president supports a house bill that threatens to penalize chinese goods. subscribe to the economic monitor to get the day's most relevant news, data and anlaysis. house of representatives passed a measure on wednesday that would treat china's yuan exchange rate, widely seen in the united states as kept artificially low, as an unfair subsidy, opening the door to punitive u.s. tariffs on chinese products entering the united states. asked whether obama would sign such a bill if it made it to his desk, spokesman <mark>robert gibbs</mark> told reporters: \"i don't have any clarity on that .\" the obama administration has stepped up criticism of beijing over its currency, mindful of the need to show that the president and fellow democrats are serious about anything that jeopardizes u.s. jobs in an election season when high unemployment and an anemic economy are voters' top concerns. <mark>gibbs</mark> said he did not know to what extent the house bill had been evaluated by the administration. \"obviously, it has at least another step, at least one more step to go in the senate,\" he said. \"lawmakers on capitol hill share the same serious concern that the president and (treasury) secretary (timothy) geithner have,\" he said. \"we have said for quite some time that the currency is undervalued and that reforms need to be undertaken .\" obama and chinese premier wen jiabao discussed china's currency and huge trade surplus with the united states during a meeting on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly last week, aides said. china on thursday warned that the house bill could seriously affect bilateral ties. relations have already been strained by a series of economic and foreign policy disputes. amazing stat -
