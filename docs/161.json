"http://vcstar.com/news/2011/dec/12/voters-first-take-on-browns-tax-plan-is-poll/?partner=RSS", "content": "california voters, convinced that state budget cuts implemented in the past few years have affected government services \"a lot\" and concerned that the state should do more to ensure equal opportunity, are inclined to support gov. <mark>jerry brown</mark>'s proposal for a five-year increase in sales taxes and income taxes paid by those making more than $250,000 a year. those are among the findings of a survey released monday by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california, which interviewed 1,316 registered voters by telephone from nov. 29 to dec. 5. <mark>brown</mark> seeks to place the proposal, which would generate an estimated $7 billion a year in revenue, before voters in a ballot initiative next fall. his temporary measure calls for increasing income taxes on all individuals with incomes exceeding $250,000 by up to 2 percent and imposing a half-cent increase in the sales tax through 2017. initial public reaction is favorable, the poll found, with 60 percent of likely voters in support and 36 percent opposed. opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines, with 78 percent of democrats in support and 54 percent of republicans opposed. \"voters are starting off with a favorable response to this tax proposal,\" said pollster mark baldassare. \"voters feel that things are at a point where we need to be doing more. there's some sense of real concern about where we go next .\" he cautioned that the poll also revealed sentiment that will create a challenging environment for passage of a tax increase: \"low approval ratings of state elected officials and high levels of distrust in government .\" the poll suggests that voters are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of recent budget cuts on government services. nearly two-thirds (65 percent) believe that cuts enacted in recent years have \"affected a lot\" the ability of local governments and school districts to deliver services. another round of cuts is expected later this week, when the state department of finance releases its assessment of state revenues so far this budget year. it is widely expected that revenues will fall $1 billion or more below projections, a situation that will trigger contingency plans that will automatically reduce funding for higher education and various social services. if those revenues are more than $2 billion below projections, a significant cut to k-12 education also will be triggered. the poll suggests voters have little stomach for further spending cuts. when asked how best to deal with the budget shortfall, 45 percent of likely voters said it should be done through a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, 11 percent said it should be done mostly through tax increases, and 33 percent said it should be done mostly through spending cuts. additionally, the poll revealed a dramatic change in how the public perceives the availability of opportunity in california. a majority (54 percent) believes that \"state government should do more to make sure californians have an equal opportunity to get ahead,\" while 37 percent believe people already have equal opportunity. when the same question was asked in 2002, the sentiment was reversed: 52 percent said equal opportunity existed, while only 43 percent believed the state needed to do more to promote equal opportunity. trust in state government remains very low, the survey found. three-quarters of likely voters said they believe the state is \"pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves\" as opposed to the general public interest. and nearly two-thirds (63 percent) believe the state government wastes \"a lot\" of money. <mark>brown</mark>'s approval rating among likely voters remained steady at 46 percent, essentially unchanged from the 47 percent he received in january, even as unemployment has remained high and state services have been pared during his first year in office. the poll also showed strong support for public pension reforms proposed by <mark>brown</mark> this fall. among all adults, 70 percent approve of the notion that employees should pay an equal share of annual contributions to their pension funds and 68 percent favored changing retirement benefits for new employees to a 401 (k) - type savings plan instead of a defined pension. <mark>brown</mark>'s proposal calls for a hybrid of the two types of plans. even among the public employees surveyed, support for those two ideas topped 60 percent. on the national level, the poll found approval of president barack obama is about evenly divided among likely voters (48 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove), while approval of the job congress is doing dropped to an all-time low of just 9 percent, with 88 percent disapproving. among likely republican voters, former house speaker newt gingrich leads the contenders for the gop presidential nomination with 33 percent, ahead of former massachusetts gov. mitt romney at 25 percent and texas congressman ron paul at 9 percent. death penalty's cost to

in paris on monday. ramallah: the obama administration is cutting off funding for the un cultural agency because it approved a palestinian bid for full membership. state department spokeswoman victoria nuland says yesterday's vote triggers a long-standing congressional restriction on funding to un bodies that recognise palestine as a state before an israeli-palestinian peace deal is reached. nuland says unesco's decision was \"regrettable, premature and undermines our shared goal to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace\" between israelis and palestinians. she says the us would refrain from making a $60 million payment it planned to make in november. article continues below but nuland said the us would maintain membership in the body. 22pc of funding the united states provides about 22 per cent of unesco's funding. earlier in the day, the united states, canada and germany voted against palestinian membership. brazil, russia, china, india, south africa and france voted in favour. britain abstained. unesco is the first un agency the palestinians have sought to join as a full member since president <mark>mahmoud abbas</mark> applied for full membership of the united nations on september 23. the palestinians want full membership in the un, but israel opposes the bid. the us says it would veto a vote in the security council. palestinians have been under immense pressure to give up their bid for statehood at the un security council as well as unesco. \"this vote will help erase a tiny part of the injustice done to the palestinian people,\" foreign minister riyad al maliki told the assembly. huge cheers went up in the unesco meeting after delegates approved the membership 107-14, with 52 abstentions. eighty-one votes were needed for approval in a hall with 173 unesco member delegations present. \"long live palestine!\" shouted one delegate, in french, at the unusually tense and dramatic meeting of unesco's general conference. us cuts unesco

not hard to notice that i am one of the older guys in the office - the grey hair tends to give it away. what's the best way to keep current and relevant in this fast changing world? all my career i was the youngest guy in the room. then, overnight, i looked around and was shocked to discover i was the oldest guy in the room. what had i done to survive, to stay one step ahead? what has happened to all the other guys? with pr's storytelling experience and advertising's ability to define brands, the two disciplines are best placed to work together says the hallway's louise pogmore. the lines between the marketing disciplines used to be very clearly defined: if you paid to insert the brand's message, it was advertising. if the message was spread via influencers, it was pr. increasingly the lines are blurring beyond recognition. we know the media landscape has shifted and is increasingly fragmented. as communication specialists, it's our job to ensure we seamlessly connect brands with consumers in the most efficient and effective way possible for our clients. last night's announcement on the departure of dan johns from ikon was up there. one of the architects of one of australia's all-too-rare local media agency success stories, his exit after a decade with the agency is a shock. while johns wasn't there quite from the beginning, he was close to the agency's original dna. last week saw the commscon conference spotlight the public relations industry at its best. but the profession still has an image problem in the wider marketing mix. nic christensen reports. a self-confessed \"reformed pr', andy lark, chief marketing officer of the commonwealth bank, revels in throwing a cat among the pigeons. with almost a hint of glee, lark did precisely this last week, during the commscon conference, when he told a room full of public relations executives they were\" the ugly red-headed child \"of the marketing world. i'm late to this fight. i find myself a little uncomfortable standing in the same corner as the over-the-top daily telegraph response to <mark>stephen conroy</mark>'s proposals for media regulation. but in truth, i'm a fellow traveller. <mark>conroy</mark>'s proposal to effectively end press self regulation is a bad thing. the risk posed to freedom of the press is relatively small, but it opens the door a crack. and in the last few days, i've found myself thinking about the miserable year i spent editing a magazine in a country that censored the press. it's a disgrace that media agency bosses are all men and their assistants are all women, argues zo boss ian perrin. marissa mayer, the issue of women in leadership has recently received a great deal of global coverage. closer to home, the debate is just as pertinent, with only seven female executives filling the role of ceo in asx 200 companies. when it comes to our industry, unfortunately, things are even worse. bad chemistry in media battle yesterday saw a string of media

awards haul. the importance of awards to the communications industry is evident by the placement of trophies in the offices of agencies across the country. at the headquarters of one sydney organisation, even the wallpaper has pictures of cannes lions on it and you'd be hard pressed to find a desk or shelf that isn't sporting a one show gold pencil - or 10. ralph van dijk, founder of creative sound agency eardrum and winner of multiple awards including sirens, lions and award awards, says: \"awards are important for business and personal reasons. we get work from advertisers, and their agencies, and advertisers are motivated by effectiveness - they know that creative, original thinking in their ads gives them more cut through. our award success gives them confidence in that, but then you've got the agencies and they need awards to improve their profile and get on pitch lists .\" that's clearly the business reason and as for the personal, van dijk says: \"truly creative people aren't usually motivated by money. we prefer acknowledgment and appreciation for the things that we make. if we were motivated by money you'd ask the ecd to scrap the awards budget and just pay us all a christmas bonus but i've never heard a creative team say that .\" <mark>michael ritchie</mark> of production house revolver, whose awards haul includes cannes lions, trophies from the uk's d & ad awards, a clio or two, one show pencils and award awards, agrees that award shows are important for the industry. he says: \"they've become more important than ever because they're an aggregator of the work that we all do. there's so much scope to the different kinds of things that we're doing in the marketing and commercial communications area that award shows have become really useful in actually pulling all that stuff together in one sphere. they really are more useful than they've ever been .\" elsewhere in the business, a film and television industry figure who was involved in this year's australian academy of cinema and television arts awards says: \"in an age where there's so much noise, a respected organisation holding up prime examples of the best of their industry is fantastic .\" perhaps the only people that will tell you awards are not important are those that don't have them. so how can you change that and get some metal on the mantle? be in it to win it obviously, in order to win awards, you need to actually enter your work in the first place. \"the first step is bloody apply for it because in several categories this year, some outstanding contenders didn't even put in a nomination, which makes it very hard for them to win,\" says the aacta awards insider. the next step to maximise your chances of winning involves doing your homework to ensure you're entering the correct category. \"at the aactas this year shaun micallef's mad as hell was nominated in the comedy category while shows like gruen and the chaser's hamster wheel were nominated for light entertainment and that was purely because they decided to enter in those categories. so you end up comparing apples and oranges and in fact you have oranges sitting in two categories that are not allowed to be compared to each other,\" says the industry insider. presentation isn't everything the next step in entering award shows is to select the work you plan to submit, a task made all the more difficult for categories related to television series when entrants are asked to submit just a couple of episodes from the show to people that may or may not have seen the series. \"people trip over themselves to follow the rules on these committees so they won't judge a show based on something they've seen outside of the nominated episodes. choose your best ones but also try to choose episodes that will let someone that hasn't seen your series access it which is a tough thing to bring together. episode one, then your best episode, probably isn't the worst idea in the world,\" says the aacta insider. with your best work selected, it's time to put together your application. while many media and ad agencies have dedicated personnel to take care of such admin, this is less likely in other sectors of the business. isabel wartho, marketing and communications manager for publishers australia, whose annual awards recognise excellence in custom magazine publishing, business to business titles and consumer magazines, says: \"read the rubric of the awards criteria and answer the questions .\" wartho also encourages entrants to put their best foot forward but cautions against going over the top. she says some of the entries they received for their awards in late 2012 were \"over engineered\". \"we did have to give our judges fairly strict instructions before the whole process began. some people tried to submit shareholders reports or fancy presentations that they have done,\" says wartho. her colleague annie wylie adds: \"bells and whistles don't count for a lot. our judges found when people complied 20-page glossy applications, it really didn't affect the way they looked at it .\" a recent bone of contention in the advertising awards process is case study videos. leo burnett melbourne's creative director andrew woodhead recently suggested in an opinion piece for encore that creatives were spending more time and money compiling case study videos than the work itself. eardum's van dijk, who heads to cannes in june to head up the radio jury, says case study videos are also starting to pop up in the radio category. \"it becomes a slightly uneven playing field. you can make a very compelling tv ad promoting a radio ad and suddenly that's been elevated. you go,\" wait a minute we're judging the piece here', \"he says. inside the jury room so you have submitted your entry and the judging process has begun. in order to maximise your chances, it pays to know what juries are looking for. matt buchanan, managing director of pr agency one green bean, was a judge at the cannes lions international festival of creativity in 2012. his criteria for judging was simple. he says:\" insight is one of the big things. a campaign grounded in innovative or interesting insight. the main thing we all talked about at cannes was effectiveness. did the work deliver on the business ambition, the commercial objectives of the client? those are the big things and it goes without saying creativity is at the heart of everything. \"revolver's <mark>ritchie</mark>, who has most recently judged the craft category at the award awards and spikes asia, says commercial objectives are less important for his judging process .\" you've got to look at what the work has done, if it's done something differently, how it has made an idea work more strongly than that idea might have otherwise worked, \"he says. when van dijk briefs his international jury in june to choose the best radio work from around the world, he will be giving them simple guidelines .\" the two-word criteria for me is relevant cleverness. it's something that's surprising, original, but relevant. relevant for the brand, the product, but also the medium. there's lots of original thinking going on, and i judge a lot of awards and hear a lot of original thinking, but unless it's relevant, it's great art but not great advertising, \"he says. that's the intellectualised version of what judges are looking for but there's another element involved entirely? feeling. van dijk says:\" creative people can tell. it's a visceral response. you feel something. you don't just look at the work and go, \"oh yeah, that's pretty good'. it makes you feel something in the back of your neck .\" and bearing in mind that the judging process often has multiple steps? for judges of most categories at the cannes lions there is a round of prejudging where in some cases thousands of pieces of work need to be viewed before arriving in the south of france? the winning work will be seen numerous times by the jury and an effective measure of whether it's a winner is often if it can still elicit that response. criteria aside, <mark>ritchie</mark> says: \"usually the best stuff floats to the surface .\" while there is little an award entrant can do about it, there is also the make up and politics of the jury room to contend with. \"you've got people who are all members of the industry and you end up with a\" horse designed by committee' scenario, \"says our aacta awards insider who believes often the work that wins is the least objectionable to all parties in the room. in the case of international award shows like the cannes lions, there has been talk in previous years of\" block voting' where jurors are pressured to select certain pieces of work in an attempt to elevate a particular agency or agency network. and at the most basic level, there is the challenge of conveying cultural nuances such as humour and local personalities to judges from other countries. perhaps the best way to improve your chances of success is to get yourself inside a jury room. eardrum's van dijk says: \"it takes an awful lot of time and i judge a lot of awards each year but it just informs everything - standards of craft, casting, ideas, what works, what doesn't. what the jury room reacts to and why. it's extremely useful .\" so you've entered your work and it's made its way through the judging process to be shortlisted for an award. you bust out your best suit or pop on a frock and head to the awards. as anyone that has been to an awards show knows, your luck could fall either way. you'll either be heading home empty handed before the ceremony even finishes or celebrating your success into the small hours. but should you be lucky enough to score a win, one green

Marquez's first MLS goal vaulted the Philadelphia Union into first place in the Eastern Conference. To add three points to their lead, the Union will have to snap Orlando City's lengthy home unbeaten streak Wednesday night. Marquez's stoppage-time score lifted Philadelphia to a 1-0 win against visiting D.C. United on Friday and pushed the Union one point ahead of New York City FC. It also extended their unbeaten streak to five matches (2-0-3). \"There's a belief in the group, I think it is clear, even when it is not our best night we can win a one-nothing game roll up our sleeves and fight,\" coach Jim Curtin told the team's official website. \"We can win in a lot of ways. We can win pretty, we can win when we are a little off and we can win on a restart. I think it's a testament to the group .\" Philadelphia, 5-3-3 overall, is 1-3-1 away from home and earned that lone win March 12 against Columbus. The Union are 2-0-1 all-time against Orlando City (3-3-5) after a 2-1 victory April 8. Tranquillo Barnetta provided the go-ahead goal in the 90th minute. Orlando heads into this matchup 6-0-6 at home since the beginning of August and 2-0-4 there this season. The club ended a six-game winless streak with a 2-1 victory over visiting Montreal on Saturday. Cyle Larin netted both goals, giving him a team-best six this season, and tallied the winner in the 87th minute. \"Let's hope it's the turning point in the season,\" coach Adrian Heath said. \"We got a win tonight, and I think the confidence will set up nicely for Wednesday ....I have got great faith with this group of players. We will keep going and not give in .\" Larin (hamstring), midfielder Brek Shea (suspension) and defender Tommy Redding (concussion) sat out the loss in Philadelphia. Orlando won't have a pair of defenders in this match.

syrup, diapers and spaghetti sauce? most critical: 4 points for canned fruits, box helpers, juice and personal care items? important items: 2 points for muffin mix, pasta, canned or dried beans, tuna, macaroni and cheese, and soup? needed items: 1 point for everything else newark - forty teams of people raced through simulated market aisles saturday as part of the supermarket sweep event at indian mound mall. supermarket sweep is the kickoff event for operation feed, the annual fundraiser for the food pantry network of licking county. four teams from both boeing and tamarack farms dairy competed, a record number for the event. although the economy is beginning to stabilize, a great need for food for those in need exists, said <mark>chuck moore</mark>, executive director of the network. in 2010, the network served 168,000 individuals, more than 820,000 meals and 32,000 families - a total of 1.9 million pounds of food. that represents a 1.3 percent increase from the need in 2009, but that is a very small increase compared to the 20 percent and 25 percent the network had experienced in the previous few years. \"we have seen a leveling off (in requests for food),\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"we are very optimistic that if we can sustain what we raised last year, that will get us through this year .\" the food and money collected for operation feed in 2010 earned 2.4 million food points, so that will be the goal again for 2011. the 2011 chairman is bob knoesel, a longtime board member for the network. \"the operation feed campaign generates approximately 70 percent of the funding and food needed annually by the food pantry network,\" knoesel said. \"this is a huge undertaking and would not be possible without the very generous support of individuals and organizations throughout the county who give so willingly of their own food resources, time, talent and money .\" the rest, or 30 percent, is collected from local donations such as churches and organizations that raise money and food throughout the year. in 2010, 115 companies, churches and groups participated in the friendly competition of operation feed. at this point, 100 organizations have signed up for 2011, <mark>moore</mark> said. \"we are optimistic we will hit the 115 mark,\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"there is always a lot of competition between schools and organizations. last year, lmh was the overall winner, and it's usually state farm .\" cash donations receive the most food points. <mark>moore</mark> said the network is able to purchase food at remarkably low prices because of its collaboration with the mid-ohio food bank. a 16-ounce box of cereal at the supermarket might cost anywhere from $2.50 to $5, but it can be purchased for just 4 cents from the food bank. \"that is why money is the most valuable to us,\" <mark>moore</mark> said. \"it allows us to purchase the items we need when we need them .\" again this year, the operation feed campaign will be teamed up with the feinstein foundation. the network will get a share of $1 million equal to the proportion of the total amount raised by all participating organizations. delaware christian

for the first time in months. mr <mark>cameron</mark> told his activists they now had a real fight on their hands. he said: \"this election was always going to be close, this election was always going to be a real choice - labour or conservative, <mark>gordon brown</mark> or me and this election was always going to be a real fight for our party, a fight to make sure we serve the country we love and

volkswagen currently has about 600 dealers in the united states. it has set aggressive sales goals for the u.s. market, where by 2018 it wants to sell 1 million vehicles. of those, 800,000 would be branded volkswagen and 200,000 audi. by way of comparison, the company sold about 360,000 vehicles in the united states in 2010. as part of its u.s. push, volkswagen will officially open a new $1 billion manufacturing plant in chattanooga, tennessee, on tuesday. the plant makes the 2012 passat sedan, which debuts in the u.s. market later this year. passat production at the plant is scheduled to rise to 150,000 annually by 2012. volkswagen once had a production plant in pennsylvania, but by 1988 sales had slowed and the plant was closed. volkswagen has gained on global sales leaders toyota motor corp (gm.n) in the past several years, and last year it sold more than 7 million vehicles worldwide for the first time. while its sales are improving in the united states, it still is a relatively small player, with a market share near 3 percent, including its luxury brand audi. volkswagen's best-performing year in the united states was 1970, when it sold 569,696 vehicles and had a

needs $1 million to avert bankruptcy, city manager says published: thursday, nov. 20, 2008 | page 2b isleton's city manager said wednesday that if the debt-laden city can't borrow $1 million by the end of the year, he will urge the city council to seek bankruptcy protection. city manager bruce pope, hired in march 2007 to repair the city's failed efforts to properly manage spending and revenues, said in an interview that he has issued several warnings about the fiscal danger the city faces if it cannot borrow $1 million to repay $950,000 in accrued debt. vice mayor <mark>michael gomez</mark> said the bankruptcy question will be discussed at the dec. 10 council meeting. \"time isn't on our side, unfortunately,\" he said, adding, \"the loan seems to be our best option. if that comes through, fantastic. if not, we do need to have a backup plan .\" the city of about 850 has an operating budget of $1.4 million, only slightly more than the needed loan. \"on numerous occasions, i've told (council members) if we don't get the loan, my recommendation the next day would be to go into (bankruptcy),\" pope said. \"i don't see any other options .\" he expects to make that recommendation at the first council meeting in january if no loan comes through. the debt accumulated during years of inattention to budgeting, a problem that helped draw the attention in february of the sacramento county grand jury. among the debts were unpaid obligations to the city's waste management contractor, the contract city attorney, utilities providers and various other creditors. \"they basically took from the accounts and threw them into the general fund and then wrote checks,\" pope said, recalling his discoveries as he worked to repair the city's financial records. \"we have to pay that back .\" more than a year ago pope proposed that the city borrow $1 million to be repaid over 10 years. the city hired an underwriter, which helped create the isleton financing authority to carry out the plan. in the meantime, the city began working with the county to transfer accounting responsibilities to that jurisdiction. in the time it took to lay the groundwork, pope said, the credit market began to tighten. now he's working with three lenders, but he's not optimistic. \"the question is,\" he said, \"are they going to take a shot with isleton?\" in the past year, other cities have begun to show the strain of a tight economy. in may, vallejo sought chapter 9 federal bankruptcy protection. pope said he believes vallejo won't be the last. \"if you look at the massive debt that the state and federal governments have accrued, you see that the little cities in in california are not on anybody's radar,\" pope said. in february, the county grand jury criticized isleton for being \"in a state of perpetual crisis\" and warned that it needed to fix both governance and fiscal problems. it said pope's efforts were helping on the fiscal front but warned that if problems could not be resolved, the city would need to take steps to dissolve itself. pope said he does not favor disincorporation. that would take two to three more years and cost about $300,000, he said.

a resolution friday supporting equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. the resolution, introduced by south africa, is the first-ever u.n. resolution on the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered persons. it passed with 23 votes in favor, 19 opposed and three abstentions, amid strong criticism of south africa by some african nations. suzanne nossel, deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told cnn, \"it really is a key part in setting a new norm that gay rights are human rights and that that has to be accepted globally .\" \"it talks about the violence and discrimination that people of lgbt persuasion experience around the world,\" she said, \"and that those issues...need to be taken seriously. it calls for reporting on what's going on, where people are being discriminated against, the violence that is taking place, and it really puts the issue squarely on the u.n.'s agenda going forward .\" divided opinion continues among some countries about whether the time has come to take up gay rights in the u.n. forum, nossel said, \"so this resolution is really significant as far as gaining widespread support for doing just that .\" the state department lobbied intensively for the resolution, and nossel said the united states was pleased to see african leadership, from south africa in particular, as well as strong support from south america, colombia and brazil. the resolution also will commission the first-ever u.n. report on the challenges that lgbt people face around the globe. nossel said the obama administration hopes it will \"open a broader international discussion on how to best promote and protect the human rights of lgbt persons .\" in march the u.n. human rights council adopted a statement, supported by 85 countries, on gay rights called \"ending violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity .\" friday's vote \"marks a victory for defenders of human rights,\" said

clinton has made gay rights a key focus of the state department's human rights agenda, expressing her view that \"gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights .\" in june, at a gay pride event at the state department, clinton said, \"men and women are harassed, beaten, subjected to sexual violence, even killed, because of who they are and whom they love. some are driven from their homes or countries, and many who become refugees confront new threats in their countries of asylum. in some places, violence against the lgbt community is permitted by law and inflamed by public calls to violence; in others, it persists insidiously behind closed doors .\" nossel told cnn, \"it's not like discrimination or violence are going to end overnight\" because of the u.n. resolution, \"but now...when there are proposals in parliaments or legislatures around the world to illegalize gay activity or repress people because of their sexual orientation, opponents can point to this and say,\" hey, the u.n. has spoken out, there is a resolution that rejects this squarely .' \"that is the way these international norms are built,\" she said. \"it's not from scratch. on women's rights, on minority rights, it builds up over time. so this is really a critical beginning of a universal recognition of a new set of rights that forms part of the international system .\" local businesses

into the brewer's third quarter ended December, the company said Wednesday, 21 January 2015, in a trading update that showed its total beer volumes are on track to shrink in its 2015 financial year. SABMiller's lager volumes were 1% lower in its third quarter after a similar contraction in the first half of its financial year, ending in March. In China, volumes fell 9% in the third quarter, following a 10% fall in the previous three months when bad weather over the peak summer season dented sales. Wholesalers remained overstocked going into the third quarter and it weighed on orders during the three-month period, a company spokesman said. Kagiso Asset Management investment analyst Dirk van Vlaanderen said: \"While China contributes around 20% of SABMiller's group volumes, it only adds around 3% to group operating profit and so the unexpected Chinese volume decline in quarter three is unlikely to have a significant profit impact at a group level .\" SABMiller said its group net producer revenue, or sales less excise and similar taxes, grew 4% in the third quarter. Continuing a previous trend, lager volumes were down 1% while soft drink sales remained buoyant, with volumes up 4% in the quarter. SABMiller CE <mark>Alan Clark</mark> said the firm's Latin American and African businesses \"continued to grow both volumes and revenues, together with Europe, while more difficult trading conditions, particularly in China, held back the overall group performance\". In Colombia - SABMiller's single most profitable market where its share of beer is about 98% - net producer revenues grew 5% with overall beverage volumes up 1%, held back by a 1% decline in lager volumes. SABMiller is preparing to deal with a fresh wave of competition in Colombia, as soft drinks group Postob\u00f3n and Heineken - controlled brewer Compania Cervecerias Unidas eye a share of the market from a brewery they are developing. SABMiller said lager volumes in the country were \"impacted by a shift in consumer spending patterns, along with pressure on disposable income driven by increased levels of household debt and rising inflation\". SABMiller's lager volumes were up most in Africa, with growth at 3%. In SA, which was consolidated under SABMiller's Africa region from July last year, net producer revenues grew 6%, \"driven by positive pack and brand mix in lager\". Both lager and soft drinks volumes grew 2%. The fastest growing African countries for the brewer were Mozambique, where net producer revenue was up 26% on a 21% jump in lager volumes; and Nigeria, where net producer revenue grew by a third. Van Vlaanderen said SABMiller's third-quarter numbers \"were a bit of a mixed bag\" with Latin America and Africa offsetting weaker performances in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. \"The negative impact of a strong US dollar against SABMiller's key currencies meant reported sales actually fell by 5% in quarter three. We remain concerned that some of SABMiller's key emerging markets remain vulnerable to slower growth rates and further currency weakness given their dependence on oil and other global commodities .\" While some severe currency devaluations were already evident, \"we believe the inevitable consumer slowdown in these regions makes the growth outlook challenging in the quarters ahead\" , Van Vlaanderen said.
