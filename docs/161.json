italy dominated but needed a penalty shoot-out to overcome a humbled english side at the olympic stadium kiev on sunday after their euro 2012 quarter-final ended in a 0-0 draw. england's <mark>ashley young</mark> hit the crossbar and ashley cole had his effort saved by gianluigi buffon, as alessandro diamanti scored the final penalty to set the azzurri up for a classic semi-final with germany in warsaw on thursday. the other semi-final sees title holders spain take on portugal on wednesday. italy won the penalty shoot-out 4-2. it was a well-deserved win for italy, who squandered plenty of chances, most notably with daniele de rossi hitting the post in the third minute and mario balotelli missing at least three good opportunities during regular time. england rarely looked threatening and were lucky not to have conceded any goals, while andrea pirlo was the outstanding man for italy at midfield. \"we played a great game and had deserved to win before the penalties, then we kept our cool and were lucky,\" italy coach cesare prandelli said. \"they were a tough side to face, and that is why i say the boys did well to play with character and heart .\" germany are now the favourites, prandelli said, \"but for now let us enjoy this victory\". despite less than stellar performances, england coach roy hodgson did not make any changes to the team that defeated ukraine, with wayne rooney fielded behind danny welbeck. prandelli picked manchester city striker balotelli alongside antonio cassano up front and replaced defender giorgio chiellini and midfielder thiago motta, who are both injured, with leonardo bonucci and riccardo montolivo. the italians had not lost against england for 15 years, with their last encounter at a major tournament ending 2-1 for the azzurri at the 1990 world cup. england, on the other hand, had been growing in confidence after entering the tournament with low expectations. but those expecting a tactical match by two defensive-minded teams were soon disappointed, with both sides facing each other openly. late in the match and with the english players looking tired, italy continued to press ahead during extra time. an italy goal in the 114th by nocerino was ruled out for off-side, and the game went to penalties. balotelli, pirlo - with a classy chipped shot - and antonio nocerino were all on target for the italians, while montolivo sent the ball wide, before diamanti sealed the match. england had steven gerrard and wayne rooney on target, but had to give up following buffon's great save on cole. \"we can go out with our head held high but it does not help the heartbreak,\" gerrard said. \"i feel for the players as they have given absolutely everything today. please be sure to enter your name and email before submitting this

the night making up for lost time and helping the north erase a 10-0 deficit after the south held the ball for nearly 12 of the first 16 minutes. minnich rang up 155 yards of total offense and scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the third quarter as the north rallied for a 21-10 victory at lexington high school to keep coach todd fox perfect in this all-star series. the loss spoiled a terrific start by the south and put a damper on head coach <mark>aaron cook</mark>'s 32nd birthday. on the plus side, <mark>cook</mark> saw two of his players at marion pleasant - jasone montgomery and tyler ferguson - take home most valuable defensive player and offensive lineman honors, respectively. \"we were most worried about their two quarterbacks,\" <mark>cook</mark> said, referring to buckeye central's tyler erwin and ashland's zach bernhard. \"they are two prolific quarterbacks who can create problems. the south held the ball for the first 8:14, driving 83 yards on 17 plays to take a 7-0 lead on mount gilead quarterback justin carver's 17-yard run. the lead increased to 10-0 when ontario's harry stickleman drilled a 32-yard field goal on the south's second possession, capping an eight-play, 65-yard drive. but after mustering 148 yards on its first two series, the south was limited to 68 yards the rest of the game. minnich, named offensive mvp, put the north in front to stay when he found the left pylon from six yards out to make it 14-10 with 2:56 left in the third quarter. it was poetic justice since minnich's two big plays in the first half went for naught. his 28-yard gain on a pitchout was wasted when the north missed a 26-yard field goal on the last play of the first quarter. on the north's first series in the second period, minnich was wide open down the left sideline for a 43-yard reception, but the drive fizzled at the 20 when he got stuffed on fourth-and-one .\" i had no idea i would get as many carries as i did, \"minnich said .\" as the quarters go on, i like getting the ball more and more, and i'm glad i got the opportunity. \"minnich, a division iii runner-up in the 100 meter dash at the state track meet three weeks ago, appeared to be in mid-season form even though the all-stars practiced for only four days .\" it's just like i said during track season, \"minnich said .\" football is never over with me, and (that attitude) paid off tonight. \"the north sealed the victory by ripping a page from the south's first quarter playbook. the north played keep-away in the fourth quarter, running 20 plays to the south's three over the first 10:29 of the final period. the kill shot was the 10-yard insurance score by plymouth running back tyler hicks on a 13-play, 58-yard drive that took 5:37 off the clock and left the south down two scores with only 1:31 to play. all-star classic: mount gilead qb carver scores south's only td in loss lexington - all mason minnich could do was watch for the first 8:14 of saturday night's buckeye

throne with a no. 1 debut for pixar animation's \"brave .\" facts weekend box office 1. \"brave,\" $66.7 million ($13.5 million international). 2. \"madagascar 3: europe's most wanted,\" $20.2 million ($30.1 million international). 3. \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter,\" $16.5 million ($8.1 million international). 4. \"prometheus,\" $10 million ($12.7 million international). 5. \"snow white & the huntsman,\" $8.01 million. 6. \"rock of ages,\" $8 million. 7. \"that's my boy,\" $7.9 million. 8. \"the avengers,\" $7 million ($2.3 million international). 9. \"men in black 3,\" $5.6 million ($10.5 million international). 10. \"seeking a friend for the end of the world,\" $3.8 million. the latest from the makers of \"wall-e,\" \"finding nemo\" and the \"toy story\" movies opened with $66.7 million domestically, according to studio estimates sunday. \"brave\" added $13.5 million in 10 overseas markets for a worldwide start of $80.2 million. featuring a feisty scottish princess, \"brave\" was the first of disney's pixar animations with a female protagonist. and it left american hero abraham lincoln in the dust. the 20th century fox action tale \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter\" opened far back at no. 3 with $16.5 million, behind \"madagascar 3: europe's most wanted .\" dreamworks animation's animated \"madagascar\" sequel had been no. 1 for two weekends and added $20.2 million to raise its domestic total to $157.6 million. \"brave\" is the 13th-straight pixar release to open at no. 1 since \"toy story\" launched hollywood's age of computer animation in 1995. \"their track record is just unbelievable,\" said paul dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker hollywood.com. \"the pixar brand just carries so much weight with the audience, it doesn't matter almost what the story is about if it has the pixar name .\" the weekend's other new wide release, steve carell and keira knightley's apocalyptic romance \"seeking a friend for the end of the world,\" misfired with just $3.8 million, debuting at no. 10. the focus features film, playing in much narrower release than other top-10 movies, stars carell and knightley as heartbroken neighbors on a road trip as a killer asteroid hurtles toward earth. woody allen's italian romance \"to rome with love\" pulled in huge audiences in limited release, debuting with $379,371 in five theaters. that gave the sony pictures classics release a whopping average of $75,874 a theater, compared to $16,028 in 4,164 cinemas for \"brave .\" \"brave\" features a voice cast led by <mark>kelly macdonald</mark> and <mark>emma thompson</mark> in a mother-daughter story of a young scottish princess defying tradition that requires her to marry against her will. the film proved that audiences will turn up for a female hero, not just the male protagonists of past pixar flicks, such as woody and buzz of \"toy story,\" the robot of \"wall-e\" or the rat and his chef buddy of \"ratatouille .\" \"brave\" matched the $66.1 million debut of pixar's \"cars 2,\" with male automotive lead lightning mcqueen, over the same weekend a year ago. \"it is a phenomenal thing, these guys and their mastery of big storytelling and character development, delivering something that plays well to adults as well as kids, to girls as well as boys,\" dave hollis, disney's head of distribution, said of pixar. the audience for \"brave\" did lean toward females, who accounted for 57 percent of viewers. two-thirds of the film's business came from families, who also continued to flock to \"madagascar 3,\" making a rare weekend when two pg-rated movies led the box office. the r-rated \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter\" was a clever idea the 16th u.s. president waging his own civil war against the blood-suckers of the republic. but critics were unimpressed, and action fans had only a passing interest in the movie, which featured relative unknown <mark>benjamin walker</mark> as lincoln. still, it was made for $69 million, a modest budget for a summer action movie, and 20th century fox had hopes it would hold up well over the next week or so before \"the amazing spider-man\" and \"the dark knight rises\" swoop in to take over cinemas in july. \"it's actually a good start for this movie,\" said chris aronson, the studio's head of distribution. \"this is an interesting and untested genre that i think audiences are going to continue to seek out. mash-ups have been done, but the historical mash-up has not been done .\" estimated ticket sales for friday through sunday at u.s. and canadian theaters, according to hollywood.com. where available, latest international numbers are also included. final domestic figures will be released monday. 1. \"brave,\" $66.7 million ($13.5 million international). 2. \"madagascar 3: europe's most wanted,\" $20.2 million ($30.1 million international). 3. \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter,\" $16.5 million ($8.1 million international). 4. \"prometheus,\" $10 million ($12.7 million international). 5. \"snow white & the huntsman,\" $8.01 million. 6. \"rock of ages,\" $8 million. 7. \"that's my boy,\" $7.9 million. 8. \"the avengers,\" $7 million ($2.3

theresa breslin, who is part of the campaign group, has raised concerns about the impact the hub plans will have on the library's children's section and youngsters during the summer holidays. she intends to give away 100 free signed copies of her books to primary pupils outside the library at 1.30 pm today (wednesday) - the first day of the school holidays - to raise awareness of her concerns and encourage reading amongst youngsters. theresa said:\" it's a protest - the building should not be closed during the school holidays. \"traditionally children would rush off to the library on the first day of the school holidays to get books, but the library is closed .\" reading is one of the great pleasures of the summer holidays and i just want to make sure the kids get books to read. \"library services for children are currently operating from the barony chambers while work is carried out on the hub. <mark>mark grant</mark>, general manager of east dunbartonshire leisure and

important to contemporary small business owners because he founded the legal system that paved the way for modern entrepreneurship. ambitious and intelligent, henry's consolidation of the 12th century british isles under his rule created the need for order. while his reforms were more for his political expediency than to empower the people, they actually gave birth to the english common law, which replaced feudal practices such as trial by ordeal. six centuries after henry's death, the tide of freedoms and property rights that evolved from his reforms washed up on the other side of the atlantic. in the colonies, a group of malcontents - america's founders - created and fought for a new interpretation of henry's legacy, which is to say, sans kings. in \"the fortune of the republic,\" ralph waldo emerson wrote, \"we began with freedom. america was opened after the feudal mischief was spent. no inquisitions here, no kings...\"in\" origins of the bill of rights, \"leonard w. levy wrote,\" freedom was a product of new world conditions. \"those conditions, as <mark>thomas jefferson</mark> so artfully wrote in the declaration of independence, were,\" ? life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \"these were 18th century words for freedom and embryonic conditions for which the 56 signers of <mark>jefferson</mark>'s document put their lives and liberties at risk on july

shows a direct connection between entrepreneurship and economic growth. and the american experiment has demonstrated that a robust entrepreneurship fosters national economic well-being. thank you, founders. without their vision, courage and sacrifice entrepreneurship as we know it would not exist today. and if capitalism is the economic lever of democracy, entrepreneurship renews the strength and reliability of that lever for each generation. we began with freedom: freedom to dream and to try; to succeed and to fail; to own and to enjoy; to accumulate and to pass on to the next generation. we began with freedom and entrepreneurship was born. we began with freedom and capitalism was made to flourish. write this on a rock: america began with freedom. happy independence day.", "articleID":
