authorities on friday said a machine pistol used by a street hustler shot dead in a times square gunfight was purchased at a virginia gun shop whose business card was found in the aspiring rapper's pocket, and they were looking for the woman who bought the gun. <mark>raymond martinez</mark>, who wrote songs about staring down cops in times square and hawked cds to tourists, was carrying a pocketful of business cards from virginia gun dealers and a stolen mac-10 pistol when he was killed by a plainclothes officer near the marriott marquis hotel. the handgun, which held 30 rounds, jammed after <mark>martinez</mark> got off three shots. jordan kelsey-stewart, 25, bought the weapon from dale's guns in powhatan, va., chief nypd police spokesman <mark>paul browne</mark> said. officials with bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives are trying to find her and are investigating whether she had any connection with <mark>martinez</mark>; a telephone listing for her could not immediately be found on friday. view all 10 photos police said kelsey-stewart reported the gun stolen from her car oct. 28 in richmond, va. it was unclear how <mark>martinez</mark> obtained it, and there was some evidence he owned it for only a brief period of time - weeks at most and perhaps just days. investigators also were trying to determine whether <mark>martinez</mark> had other weapons. they said they found a .22 - caliber handgun during a police search of <mark>martinez</mark>'s home on friday. story: exclusive: times sqr. gunman's mom talks to ewn story: suspect killed in times square shooting more: see news? send it to eyewitness news! more: get email updates: pick your topics here \"we're actively investigating whether he was involved in purchasing firearms,\" <mark>browne</mark> said. dale blankenship, who owns dale's guns, said he provided the information about who bought the gun to the atf earlier friday. he said kelsey-stewart was from the richmond area, had all the proper identification and passed a background check when she purchased the weapon. blankenship said she bought the gun by herself. he didn't know what happened to the gun after he sold it. \"i have no idea,\" he told the associated press. \"i really don't know what happened. i don't know how the gun was stolen .\" <mark>martinez</mark>, 25, went by the rap name \"ready\" and regularly sold cds for his group, square free, in times square. he was part of a freelance collection of hawkers who sell self-produced wares on the street. police said <mark>martinez</mark> ran a scam in which he would autograph a cd or put a passerby's name on it, and then demand payment of $10. he had been arrested june 19 at 1515 broadway, the exact same location where thursday's confrontation started, for not having a tax stamp, which allows hawkers to sell their self-produced wares. vendors selling their own work are protected by the first amendment and fall outside the stricter regulation of vendors selling retail goods. the sheer number of vendors in times square and their aggressiveness lead to frequent confrontations with authorities trying to catch counterfeiters and protect tourists from scams. <mark>martinez</mark> and his brother are well known to regular times square denizens and videos of them rapping and getting hassled by police are posted on youtube. in one shaky video, <mark>martinez</mark> shouts, \"they ain't taking me nowhere!\" and \"i'm ready to lay some down!\" as officers, their hands in their pockets, escort him from the area. his lyrics talk of hawking cds and staring down cops. sgt. christopher newsom usually works in uniform on a task force that tracks aggressive peddling. he was in plainclothes when he stopped <mark>martinez</mark> on thursday and asked him for his tax stamp, setting off the chase and shootout. josiah deandrea, who was distributing fliers friday to a comedy act a block from the shooting scene, said he had seen <mark>martinez</mark> in the area in the past. \"nobody had any idea he had a gun,\" deandrea said. daniel o'phalen, 24, who passes out fliers in times square for the musical \"white christmas,\" said <mark>martinez</mark> was part of a regular crew of cd salesmen. sometimes, he said, the group would order him off a corner, saying he was on their territory. \"they're pushy. they're not nice guys,\" he said. still, it's rare that police encounters with peddlers escalate to gunfire. \"these are usually quality-of-life violations, and they typically do not escalate, they don't involve violators being armed,\" <mark>browne</mark> said. if <mark>martinez</mark> had recently gone looking for a gun, it wouldn't have been unusual for him to look out of state. because buying a firearm is so difficult in new york, people barred from owning pistols here often travel south to shop at gun shows where there are no required background checks for people buying secondhand weapons. <mark>martinez</mark> didn't have a license to own a firearm. there is also a steady supply of guns purchased at southern gun shops and smuggled north. mayor michael bloomberg has been a fierce critic of gun stores with a record of selling weapons that later wound up in the hands of criminals, suing several of them in recent years for reckless conduct and driving several out of business. there are \"too many guns on the streets,\" the mayor said friday. \"this is one of the great public health threats. and our police officers are clearly in danger .\" the machine pistol like the type used thursday are rare in the city: only 26 have been recovered so far this year, compared with 5,427 other guns. in 2008, there were 46 recovered, and 5,959 other guns .--associated press

(ap)--when <mark>carlos rivera</mark> returned from fighting in iraq and found work as an electrician, he felt co-workers who knew about his military experience were gawking at him. he went home angry each day. that's not a problem at his current job working alongside other combat veterans picking avocados, mixing organic fertilizers and gathering basil amid northern san diego county's undulating ochre hills. \"i'm outdoors, not stuck inside somewhere feeling suffocated,\" said <mark>rivera</mark>, 25, who returned from iraq in 2007 after four years as a marine. \"there's always someone to talk to, someone there to understand .\" <mark>rivera</mark> works at archi's acres, a 3-acre high-tech organic farm owned by colin archipley, who served three tours in iraq and is trying to help other combat vets shake the trauma of war by turning swords to plowshares. working the earth has long been recognized as good therapy for war veterans. about 20 u.s. department of veterans affairs centers have gardening programs, said anthony campinell, the va's national director for work therapy programs. he said archi's acres is the only fully commercial enterprise of which he was aware. veterans have grown fruits, vegetables and flowers on a 12-acre parcel at the va hospital in west los angeles since 1986. they sold their produce at farmers markets until april, when administrators had them take a break while they work out a deal for a nonprofit group to take over the commercial parts of that program. patients at the veteran affairs medical center near newark, n.j., meanwhile, work in a 2-year-old garden harvesting corn, rhubarb and collard greens, some of which are served at the hospital's cafe. \"how much better can one feel about themselves than if you can make a meal out of things that you grew?\" said ucla psychiatry professor c. scott saunders, who specializes in treating post-traumatic stress disorder among combat veterans. archipley, 28, whose unit took part in the initial invasion of iraq and the later decisive battles in fallujah and haditha, returned from battle in 2006 too agitated to pursue plans to sell houses. instead, he decided to try his hand at farming, despite having no background in agriculture. he and his wife karen started with the 200 avocado trees left on the property they bought while he was still a marine sergeant. realizing the trees were not enough to sustain a business, the archipleys added herbs and leafy greens grown using hydroponics, a method of cultivating plants without soil that requires less water and land than traditional farming. the balmy air in archipley's sunlit greenhouse is thick with the aroma of basil, bunches of which poke through holes in long plastic tubes arranged in vertical rows. thin streams of water enriched with a potent \"compost tea\" run silently along the bottoms of the tubes. wrinkled leaves of chard and deep-green lettuces sprout outside the greenhouse. archipley said he knew other vets would be solid employees and they would benefit from the distraction provided by steady, regimented labor, just as he had. \"when our hands stop working and our minds start running, that's when bad things start to happen. so we keep the work load heavy. we stay busy,\" he said. \"for me, if i slow down, if i stop doing what i'm focussed on, that's when i can get myself in trouble .\" archipley said he thinks his workers are soothed by the farm's rural atmosphere, since the noise and pace of city life might remind them of the urban battle zones where many fought. jeffery scanlon, who places veterans at archi's acres as manager of the va's work therapy programs in san diego, said working with plants appears to help war-rattled vets regain their self-confidence. \"the plants aren't talking back to them,\" he said. \"you feel more in touch with something that doesn't give you what we would consider negative feedback .\" archipley pays a fee to the va to cover salaries and placement program expenses. the va takes care of the workers' insurance, health care and other costs. archipley's staff has grown from two to eight since he began hiring the veterans, and he recently bought an adjacent three-acre parcel where he plans more greenhouses and outdoor growing facilities. the farm's growth is being sustained by demand for its products, which are sold at area whole foods outlets, other grocery stores and farmers' markets. scanlon said he has spoken with va administrators about replicating the collaboration with the farm in other parts of the country. the emphasis on greenhouse cultivation makes it a model for areas too cold for year-round field farming, he said. campinell said he's open to that idea, but his department would need to find other hydroponic farms that want to hire veterans, since the va doesn't set up new businesses. the veterans at archipley's operation, meanwhile, appear grateful for the opportunity to put down their own roots in civilian life. \"this type of work, gardening, getting your hands in the mix, it all helps,\" said anthony licon, whose 21 years in army and marines special operations forces took him to trouble spots in the middle east, central america and other locations. <mark>rivera</mark> said talking with customers at farmers markets has helped him the most. \"i'm dealing with people and looking them in the eye and learning how to be happy around people,\" he said. \"the other jobs i had, i used to just go home and be angry,\" he continued. \"now i actually look forward to work .\" ", "articleID":

both miss malaysia/world 2006 and miss malaysia/universe 2009 not only turned up on time, she came fully made-up and prepared. as she has taken part in several beauty pageants and worked as a model, she only knows too well that to be successful in any field, one has to have discipline. but cassandra has more than just that. meeting her for the first time, i was instantly struck by her beauty. you see, cassandra has a rich and varied her itage. her dad is part punjabi and dusun from sabah. her mum is scottish and kadazan while her late grandfather was part indonesian. hence her exotic looks. standing at 5' 10\" (minus the heels mind you!), cassandra said ever since she was a child, she had always wondered what it was like to be a beauty queen. \"watching the girls clad in beautiful gowns and looking so poised and all, i've always wanted to be in their shoes or their gowns! so i decided to enter some beauty contests just to see what it's like,\" said cassandra, whose grandmother, mother and aunts were all winners of local beauty pageants in their heyday. \"when i joined the 2006 miss malaysia/world, i was very naive. i was pretty bad in fashion and hated high heels. but then i read magazines and learnt how to do make-up and hair from industry experts. i was also lucky to have people like marina suwendy (a successful local model now based in new york) teaching me everything i needed to know about this industry .\" suwendy was so graceful that when she walked, everyone will watch. i was the total opposite! \"still, when she represented the country at miss tourism queen international in <mark>zheng zhou</mark>, china, last august, cassandra made it to the top 20 in a field of 98 contestants .\" my chaperon told me, \"this is a competition, so you better absorb it like a sponge\". she also said the judges were not looking at our body alone but what's inside. i'm also grateful to my trainer, simone teh (a former model), who taught me to walk right. \"the experience was amazing. we went for tours and learnt some basic chinese martial arts like kung fu and tai chi. but what i like most about china is that the people are very proud of their country. we should emulate that spirit .\" cassandra, born in the united states but raised in sabah, started modelling at the age of 15. her parents made sure that both their daughters received the best education. \"i modelled for several years during my teens but had to stop because of my studies. my dad holds two masters, so naturally, he wanted us to follow in his footsteps. model and former beauty queen cassandra plans to release her single next year. when my sister earned a government scholarship to pursue her studies, my mum was so fired up that she pushed me to do the same .\" after finishing school, i went to br itain to do my a-levels and came back to do my stpm. i don't come from a rich family, so i studied in a government school for my stpm because it was cheaper. after i had completed my stpm, i enrolled in kdu to read law. \"due to financial problems, she defer red her studies but plans to complete them once she is able to do so. in the meantime, the lass wants to give singing a shot .\" i come from a musically-inclined family. my dad plays the guitar and keyboard and has a band of his own. he also sings and he does remind me of ole' blue eyes, frank sinatra, when he wakes us up in the morning with his singing! \"my mum also sings. when i was a kid, my dad always put me out there at family gatherings to entertain the crowd. i gladly obliged and would give my best rendition of leann rhymes' how do i live. it's the song i sang at school auditions to get into the choir,\" she remembers with a laugh. by the way, she did get into the school choir. by next year, we should be able to sample what exotic cassandra has to offer as she is working on her first single. what is it going to sound like? \"for now, all i can tell you is that the song is going to be a pop number,\" said cassandra. although she stands at a commanding height, it is hard to believe that the industry hasn't really noticed this down-to-earth personality. cassandra, who speaks malay, english, kadazan, dusun and a smattering of hindi (\"my late grandpa used to make me watch all the bollywood movies while my mum loved any p. ramlee flick\" ), is also adept at hosting. \"local designer syeba yip was the one who pushed me into doing it. thanks to her, i hosted mifa (malaysia international fashion week) two years in a row now. i am now not as jittery as before. it's good to know that i have built some self-confidence .\" cassandra is afraid she would have nothing to fall back on should she not make it in show business. but then again, this typical leo, who describes herself as \"tough but loving\" , is intent on marching forward with her plans. \"life is full of challenges and i thrive on that. life can also be simple, so why make it difficult, right?\" i couldn't agree with you more! singing * sports car or suv? sports car, especially the luxurious aston martin. i love speed! * manchester united, liverpool, chelsea or arsenal? used to be an mu fan but

who were up to no good, tried to make trouble in his neighborhood. after one little fight his mom got scared and informed him that he was\" movin' with your auntie and uncle in bel-air! \"<mark>smith</mark> begged and pleaded with her day after day, but she packed his suit case and sent him on his way. she gave him a kiss and then she gave him his ticket, he then put his walkman on and decided that he\" might as well kick it \". after deciding that first class was\" bad', and drinking some orange juice out of a champagne glass. this left <mark>smith</mark> wondering if this is what the people of bel-air live like, proceeding to ponder that it might be \"aiiight'. however, <mark>smith</mark> had heard they're prissy, with wine and all that, and wondered if bel-air is the type of place to send a cool cat. he didn't think so, but decided to see when he got there and hoped they were prepared for the prince of bel-air. <mark>smith</mark> has stated that the plane landed and when he came out, there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with his name out. he wasn't tryin' to get arrested as he had just got there, so he sprang with the quickness of lightning and disappeared. he whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. although <mark>smith</mark> thought this cab was rare, he forgot and directed the\" homes' to bel-air. he arrived at the house about 7 or 8 and hollered at the cabbie that he would \"smell him later\". he then looked at his kindom, as he was finally there, to sit on his throne as the prince of bel air. early career yes...he is a legend. hip-hop <mark>smith</mark> began his media career as one third of the hip-hop trio dj jazzy jeff & the fresh prince, along with fellow artists and black men jeffery townes and clarence holmes. the group was fairly successful, and won the first ever grammy by a rap act. <mark>smith</mark>, however, decided to leave the group in the late 1980s in order to move onto bigger and better things. the fresh prince of bel-air after moderate success in music, <mark>smith</mark> moved on to the next logical stage of his career: comedy sitcoms on network television. fortunately for <mark>smith</mark>, nbc was looking for exactly what <mark>smith</mark> offered-a black man with little-to-no acting or comedic experience. history was made. what resulted was the fresh prince of bel-air, arguably the sixth-greatest african-american sitcom of all time. the program aired from 1990 until 1996, and though it is now largely forgotten aside from its theme song, the real importance of fresh prince was its introduction of <mark>will smith</mark> and his acting greatness to the rest of the world. film career 1995-1997: early years <mark>will smith</mark>, seen here in box office hit men in black, with gun. after moderate success in television, <mark>will smith</mark> moved on to the next logical step in his career: playing the lead in hollywood blockbuster action movies. <mark>smith</mark>'s hollywood career began in 1995 when he was approached by sub-par director, clich\u00e9 enthusiast and noted add sufferer michael bay to play the lead in director's [sic] new film [sic], bad boys. though the movie's gross was only in the low hundreds of millions of dollars, <mark>smith</mark>'s riveting portrayal of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a gun made waves around hollywood: it wouldn't be long before other shitty directors took notice. the following year, <mark>smith</mark> was approached by another industry giant with an affinity for explosions: roland emmerich. emmerich was incredibly impressed with <mark>smith</mark>'s performance in bad boys, and promptly cast the actor in the role of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a fighter jet alongside jeff goldblum and the dad from casper in his own retarded blockbuster: independence day. independence day would prove to be a mega-hit, breaking several box office records, as well as earning the distinction of being the third most-played movie on basic cable, behind only top gun and rocky ii. <mark>smith</mark>'s acting earned similar distinction, being praised as being \"totally derived from earlier works\" by many critics. in 1997, <mark>smith</mark> was cast as disgruntled low-level authority figure with a laser gun (shortened to \"agent j\" during shooting) in men in black. with yet another success under his belt, men in black would prove to be the first high water mark in <mark>smith</mark>'s film career. 1998-2001: the slump <mark>will smith</mark>, seen here in box office flop <mark>ali</mark>, without gun. <mark>will smith</mark> had quickly become one of hollywood's most successful-and most bankable - actors. in 1998, he accepted the role of disgruntled conspiracy theorist with a gun in enemy of the state. the film proved to be a radical departure from <mark>smith</mark>'s prior work, and box office revenues reflected it. <mark>smith</mark> followed this disappointment with arguably his worst career move: the actor opted out of the role of neo in the matrix in favor of doing wild wild west. when later asked about this utterly terrible decision, <mark>will smith</mark> simply replied that the part of neo \"wasn't disgruntled enough .\" after the utter failure of west, <mark>smith</mark> would have a quiet 2000, before almost killing his career for good the following year. in 2001, film auteur <mark>michael mann</mark> approached <mark>smith</mark> with his project <mark>ali</mark>, an ambitious bio-epic about legendary boxer <mark>mohammad ali</mark>. at first, <mark>smith</mark> was reticent about accepting the role, as <mark>ali</mark> was not comically but dramatically disgruntled, and lacked a firearm. however, the actor finally accepted. though the film earned him a surprise oscar nomination for best actor, the film - like almost all good movies - achieved merely an adequate box office performance. <mark>smith</mark>'s agent quickly dropped him, and the actor's career looked like it was finished. <mark>smith</mark> would have to go back to his roots to find success, which, in the realm of hollywood blockbusters, meant doing a sequel. 2002-present: back in form <mark>will smith</mark>, seen here in box office hit i am legend, with gun. following the <mark>ali</mark> debacle, <mark>will smith</mark> did back-to-back sequels to revive his slumping career. in 2002, he reprised his role of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a laser gun in men in black ii, and the following year went back to where it all began with bad boys 2 and another classic portrayal of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a gun. now with two back-to-back hits and $35 million from said hits under his belt, <mark>smith</mark> was free to explore the limits his typecast would allow him to go. in 2004, <mark>smith</mark> played disgruntled low-level authority figure with a gun and a prejudice against robots in i, robot, which proved to be yet another success. <mark>smith</mark> followed up the success of i, robot with his acclaimed portrayal of disgruntled scientist with a gun in i am legend and disgruntled homeless man with super powers in hancock, both being sizeable financial successes. future plans much speculation exists as to what new career <mark>will smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> use his hollywood success to parlay himself into. some believe that <mark>smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> use his notable-though-moderate acting success to inexplicably parlay himself into politics, a la ronald reagan. most hollywood demographers, however, are of the opinion that <mark>will smith</mark>'s charisma and appeal to men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 <mark>will</mark> eventually lead him into running a religious cult. in any event, one thing is certain: <mark>will smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> achieve levels of success and recognition far higher than what his actual level of talent would preclude. see also hollywood angelina jolie keanu reeves michael bay money retrieved from \"\"category: actors", "articleID": "2009122011_00018818_W", "names": {"Michael Mann": ["Q1425193", "Q1827335", "Q1928511", "Q270097", "Q30276452", "Q633081", "Q6832490"], "Mohammad Ali": ["Q17107656", "Q21459588", "Q21471133", "Q25471258", "Q48732199", "Q54268652", "Q56487592", "Q57945156", "Q5990591", "Q9322458"], "Will Smith": ["Q16981006", "Q20727796", "Q24678701", "Q3568301", "Q3568303", "Q40096", "Q51226643", "Q56528891", "Q8003105", "Q8003106", "Q8003108"]}}, {"date": "2009-12-21", "url": "http://aviation.ca/content/view/8297/117/", "content": "please log in to view the metar/taf reports aviation.ca -
