Why focus on Wright, American architecture's equivalent of Abraham Lincoln, the giant who casts a shadow over his field big enough to blot out smaller and underrepresented figures? [...] Because the architect's brilliant if forbidding Southern California houses, the most important of which were designed in a burst of creative energy during the first few months of 1923, remain mysterious, their meaning and inspiration as opaque as their heavy, richly patterned concrete-block facades .--latimes.com Christopher Hawthorne's documentary, \"That Far Corner: <mark>Frank Lloyd</mark> Wright in Los Angeles\" , focuses on aspects of the infamous architect's work which remain enigmatic. Filming inside eight Wright buildings, the project interviews around 20 people to present new insights around these mysterious works. Hawthorne explains, \"My overarching goal was to bring some new, sustained attention to a group of houses that have lingered too long, given their importance to the American architectural canon, in the relative shadows .\" The title \"That Far Corner\" originates from a phrase Wright used to describe Southern California in his autobiography. As part of a new ARTBOUND season, the documentary airs next Tuesday March 6, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on KCET-TV. The episode will also stream online at KCET, as well as on Amazon, YouTube, Roku, and Apple TV following its broadcast. Tune in and decide what you make of Hawthorne's theory. As a bonus, several of the interviews occur inside residential designs by Rudolph Schindler, <mark>Charles Moore</mark> and <mark>William Turnbull</mark>, and Richard Neutra.

It shows that worrying about the future of cricket, and English cricket in particular, is nothing new. However, whereas Sutcliffe was concerned by ice skating and greyhound racing taking people away from cricket, the worry now is about how one type of cricket--Twenty20 (T20) franchise leagues--could spell the end of another in five-day Tests. The recent decisions of England internationals Adil Rashid and Alex Hales to sign \"white-ball\" only county contracts--a red ball is used in traditional first-class matches--this season, thereby opting out of Test contention, heightened these concerns. Rashid and Hales have not played a Test since 2016, but the worry for some is that, without a major alteration to cricket's congested schedule and a change in spectator habits--Tests outside of England and Australia often draw paltry crowds--their example might be followed by that of more high-profile cricketers. Jonny Bairstow, a Yorkshire and England teammate of Rashid, is alive to the danger, although the wicketkeeper remains committed to continuing his Test career. \"If we're not careful, there are going to be more and more people [giving up red-ball cricket],\" said Bairstow, who is on tour with England in New Zealand. \"You've got lucrative tournaments...[to] go off for five weeks and earn a heck of a lot of money...[with] the strain and stress on the body of bowling [only] four overs compared to 24 in a day in Test cricket,\" he said. Bairstow's thoughts were echoed by Test colleague <mark>James Anderson</mark>, with England's all-time leading Test bowler adding: \"I just hope and pray there is enough love for Test cricket out there, not just the players that are playing at the moment, but players coming through still having the ambition and drive to play Test cricket in the future .\" Bairstow and <mark>Anderson</mark> grew up in an environment where the most reliable way for cricketers to maximize their income was to become an established Test player, as this would lead to a larger wage packet and enhanced opportunities for sponsorship deals. To gain Test selection, players would have to take part in domestic first-class competitions such as England's County Championship or Australia's Sheffield Shield. However, the advent of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other T20 franchise events has created an environment where it is now possible to make major money, in cricket terms, without playing Tests. For example, England all-rounder Ben Stokes was bought for \uffe1 1.37 million (US $1.89 million) by the Rajasthan Royals during January's IPL auction. By offering specialist \"white-ball,\" as well as Test, central contracts in a bid to improve England's woeful record at major global limited-overs tournaments, the England and Wales Cricket Board might have inadvertently made it easier for players to turn their backs on the first-class game. \"You always want your best players playing as much high-quality cricket as you can,\" England selector <mark>Angus Fraser</mark> said on Friday.", "articleID": "2018030316_00247880_W", "names": {"Angus Fraser": ["Q19325047", "Q4764116", "Q4764119"], "James Anderson": ["Q1398542", "Q1679949", "Q21516191", "Q2419972", "Q27887229", "Q27887279", "Q30066238", "Q43395084", "Q43912040", "Q5652449", "Q58385467", "Q6128699", "Q6128708", "Q6128711", "Q654375"]}}, {"date": "2018-03-03", "url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/pti-feed/story/bjd-ridicules-shah-for-statement-on-winning-odisha-1181353-2018-03-03", "content": "READ LATER BJD ridicules <mark>Shah</mark> for statement on winning Odisha March 3, 2018 UPDATED 21:25 IST March 3, 2018 UPDATED 21:25 IST READ LATER Bhubaneswar, Mar 3 (PTI) BJD leaders today ridiculed BJP president <mark>Amit</mark> Shahs statement and claimed that the saffron partys \"dream\" of forming the government Odisha will never be fulfilled even though it has won in Tripura and other north eastern states.

Follow Melissa Nova, Victoria If the Queen's getting a \u00a3 369m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, it seems only fair that the neighbourhood surrounding it should get a polish, too. \u00a3 4bn should just about cover it, and that's how much has been invested in the area by developer Land Securities over the last five years. Around \u00a3 700m of that has gone on revamping the train station, a major terminus that's also set to be a hub for Crossrail 2, if current proposals go ahead. Traditionally, the areas around big rail stations haven't made desirable places to live and Victoria was no exception. Tall, grey, faceless office blocks characterised much of its property stock for decades and the retail offering was pretty poor, making it one of the cheapest spots in central London. Now, new homes make up two thirds of all sales in the area, with \u00a3 262m changing hands in the resi market in 2017, more than twice the amount on the year before, according to figures compiled by David Fell, research analyst at Hamptons International. He nods to Nova, where penthouses go for \u00a3 8m, and \"facadism\" , described as \"schemes that keep the front of the building while knocking down everything behind. We have seen a big influx of prime tenants ranging from CEOs to Middle Eastern royalty Developers are increasing using 19th century grandeur to conceal living space designed for the 21st century .\" Good transport links--it's on the Victoria and Circle lines in Zone One, as well as a being a gateway to the south of England and Gatwick Aiport--are only going to get better with the refurbishment of Victoria coach station, too. This makes it the perfect place for a London bolthole, says <mark>Tom</mark> Bond from UK Sotheby's International Realty, who is seeing \"a significant number of buyers from the commuter hotspots including Surrey and Berkshire, who are seeing a convenient second home in the capital .\" Hamilton at the Victoria Palace Theatre The influx of new homes and better transport has also made it a popular place for premium lets, according to Jo Eccles from SPPG. \"We have seen a big influx of prime tenants ranging from CEOs to Middle Eastern royalty. They or their relocation agents are specifically targeting Victoria as a location and the most popular buildings are 44 Victoria Street and Nova, with steady demand for rental properties in the \u00a3 1,000 to \u00a3 3,500 a week range .\" With new businesses moving in--Deutsche Bank, <mark>Tom Ford</mark>, Google and the UK's new National Cyber Security Centre--as well as new residents, top names in retail and hospitality have been lured to the area, from Molten Brown to Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton's latest restaurant Hai Cenato. \"People no longer walk through Victoria to get to their destination, but choose to stay to enjoy the exciting array of new restaurants and shops, which is drawing a young crowd,\" says Martin Bikhit from Kay & Co.. But traditionalists will still find secluded enclaves of 18th century terraced housing tucked behind Victoria Street, and according to Kirsty Sugden of Dexters Westminster, \"surrounding Westminster Cathedral are a host of red-brick mansion blocks dating from the Victorian and Edwardian period .\" Mostly, Victoria is known for its diverse housing stock and bright future. \"You may find a one bedroom flat for \u00a3 550,000 around the corner from a \u00a3 20m townhouse,\" Sugden adds. Boisdale Belgravia Area highlights One of London's most highly-anticipated musicals, Hamilton, took up residence in the refurbished Victoria Palace Theatre last year and it's the hottest ticket in town. A view of Westminster Cathedral, the mother Catholic Church for England and Wales with stripped back Byzantine-style architecture, is often a perk of buying property in Victoria. A Royal Park, St James's, is right on your doorstep for picturesque jogs and the changing of the guard. For robust Scottish fare and a fine cigar, Boisdale of Belgravia is only a few paces away from Victoria Station and has an impressive selection of whisky on offer, too. Cardinal Place is one of many new shopping havens on Victoria Street, but has a particularly good food offering, with a food market every Thursday lunchtime. Full to the brim, waddle over to the Curzon Victoria on the same street to take in a film in one of its comfy sofa seats. Then check out the new restaurant quarter around the Nova building.
