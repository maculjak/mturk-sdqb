When the Buccaneers selected <mark>Evans</mark> in 2014, he was among the youngest players in the league. Last season, the former Texas A & M receiver was still younger than many 2016 rookies. But <mark>Evans</mark> is feeling like a veteran, and it isn't simply his three years of leading the Bucss in receiving yards and touchdowns (he's 1,440 yards and seven touchdowns from the team record in both categories). It's his status within the team. With the departure of <mark>Vincent Jackson</mark> this offseason, <mark>Evans</mark> has become a relative veteran compared to rookie and third year receivers Chris Godwin and Adam Humphries or the similarly young tight end group. While DeSean Jackson adds experience from his nine seasons combined in Philadelphia and Washington, <mark>Evans</mark> said he's always felt like a leader .\" I was a leader since I've been here, \"<mark>Evans</mark> said .\" First along with [<mark>Vincent Jackson</mark>], and then when he went down this year I was able to lead the guys and that's carried over without him. They're older than me, but I've got a lot of experience. We've got a lot of capable guys and it's been fun. \"That leadership starts with the fact that he's even at One Buc Place during voluntary OTAs. Every team hopes for full attendance, but a star player approaching the end of their rookie contract might just be the type to wait it out. Yet there was <mark>Evans</mark>, making a trademark high-point catch from a Jameis Winston catch for a touchdown Thursday and throwing down a powerful dunk over the goal posts to celebrate. <mark>Evans</mark> said he values the importance of organized team activities (OTAs) at his position too much to miss .\" Receivers and quarterbacks can get a lot more out of OTAs than other positions, \"<mark>Evans</mark> said .\" They can't use their pads, but we can run routes and get the timing right, which is really important. \"It wasn't simply other receivers watching <mark>Evans</mark> Thursday in practice. Orlando-born boxer Erickson Lubin--formerly the world's No. 1-ranked junior middleweight before turning professional last year--was in attendance, too. <mark>Evans</mark>, a boxing fan and a fan of Lubin in particular, said he specifically wanted to meet the 21-year-old fighter, while Lubin said he was a fan of <mark>Evans</mark> both on and off the field .\" I love his personality, \"Lubin said .\" He has a great personality. He's a welcoming person. And he's a fighter, just like I am. He goes out and gives his all every game. He told me that he's a big fan of me, and I'm a big fan of him. \"Within a season's reach of the franchise's key receiving records and with a major contract likely on the way, perhaps <mark>Evans</mark> could be forgiven for focusing on his own stats. But with Jameis Winston possessing a greater array of weapons in 2017 than ever before, <mark>Evans</mark>' goals for the year are team-focused .\" If I catch zero passes but we win the Super Bowl, I wouldn't have a problem. \"", "articleID": "2017060922_00548935_W", "names": {"Mike Evans": ["Q14951064", "Q1621683", "Q25189874", "Q6846717", "Q6846719"], "Richard Sherman": ["Q16205086", "Q2947411"], "Vincent Jackson": ["Q204172", "Q4013045"]}}, {"date": "2017-06-10", "url": "http://journal.com.ph/sports/kings-play-texters", "content": "FOR finishing off their quarterfinal rival right away, Barangay Ginebra and coach Tim Cone also got time to prepare and some luxury to scout their potential semifinal opponent. Obviously Cone did watch the three episodes of the TNT-Meralco quarterfinal series and got something to focus on in the semifinals of the PBA Commissioner's Cup. \"The TnT/Meralco series was an epic battle, but it presents a very interesting matchup for us,\" said Cone, whose Gin Kings will play the Tropang Texters in the best-of-5 semifinal series starting today at the Mall of Asia Arena. Cone is visibly impressed with the way the Texters executed what he called their \"in and out game' and import <mark>Joshua Smith</mark>'s flexibility on both ends of the court. <mark>Smith</mark> actually averaged 22.2 points and 24 rebounds as he stood at the forefront of the Tropang Texters who beat Meralco in three games in the quarterfinals. Needless to say, the Gin Kings need to put more premium on defending what Cone describes as a\" massive' TNT import. \"We're going to have to find ways to battle their in and out game with their massive import,\" said Cone, who is looking to bring the Gin Kings to their third straight finals appearance under his watch. \"It will be tough for us to defend. We have problems dealing with huge import, and we have to figure that out,\" added Cone. On the other hand, the Texters will have to find ways to keep pace with the Gin Kings' quickness and Cone himself is saying that. \"They, of course, will have to find ways to stop our quickness and like I said, (the series is) very interesting indeed,\" said Cone, who is counting on import Justin Brownlee, Japeth Aguilar and Joe Devance, <mark>Scottie Thompson</mark> who all run faster. One interesting matchup that's expected to highlight the 6:30 p.m. opener of their brief series is between L.A. Tenorio of Ginebra and TNT's Jayson Castro. The Gin Kings asserted their might as the playoff top seed and crushed Globalport, 96-85, to advance to the semis Tuesday in a game marred by the ejection of Batang Pier's top gunner Terrence Romeo. The other half of the Final Four is between San Miguel Beer and Star Hotshots who started their separate series last night.

Catwoman and Batman's love affair has filled decades of comic book pages with both romance and butt-kicking. No matter what DC timeline the two have tangled in, they always end up teaming - up in cowl and claws to overcome the enemies of Gotham City. The two haven't always seen eye to eye over the years, but Catwoman has consistently been one of the most important and reliable members of the Bat-Family. Despite the majority of their time together spent hiding behind masks as they flirt and fight across Gotham's rooftops, Selina Kyle is one of the few people who truly understands Bruce Wayn e and vice versa. RELATED: 15 CRAZIEST Things From Batman: Knightfall After Catwoman first clawed her way into Batman's life in 1940's Batman #1, their relationship has been a vehicle in which to discover new and surprising elements of both Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's character. On the surface, the crusading vigilante and the thrill-seeking burglar couldn't be more different. But as their feelings grew through countless adventures, the Bat and the Cat learned how perfect for one another they actually were. Writer <mark>Tom King</mark> has been exploring still newer facets of their complex relationship throughout Batman \"Rebirth .\" In honor of Batman finally popping \"the question\" to Catwoman in Batman #24, CBR has collected some of the very best Catwoman/Batman team-ups! 15. REBIRTH Catwoman has been a major player in <mark>Tom King</mark>'s \"Rebirth\" Batman title since 2016. In \"I Am Suicide,\" Batman assembles a crack suicide squad of his own, including Catwoman, to break into Santa Prisca prison and steal the Psycho Pirate from Bane in order to help heal Gotham Girl's damaged psyche. Catwoman, who is on death row for killing 237 people, pretends to betray Batman for Bane, but that ploy turns out to be a double blind and the Cat breaks Bane's back just as Bane is about to crush Batman. When Bane returns to Gotham for revenge in \"I Am Bane,\" Catwoman once again proves herself to be Batman's most unpredictable ally, as she pretends to be kidnapped by Bane only to escape and free Bane's other Bat-Family hostages. 14. ROOFTOPS In Batman #14's \"Rooftops\" arc, Batman reveals to Catwoman as they smooch it out along Gotham's harbor that due to Bruce's deal with Amanda Waller, Catwoman will only receive a lifetime sentence without parole instead of the death penalty. How romantic! Batman needs to take Catwoman, in but instead, Selina convinces him to let them have one more night together. The two lovers take down a sling of minor villains like Clock <mark>King</mark> and Kite Man before passionately making love and fondly reminiscing of the first time they met one another. In a quaint and emotional callback to their storied history, Bruce references Batman #1 while Selina recalls their encounter in Frank Miller's \"Year One .\" Catwoman being Catwoman, she tells Bruce to chase her one last time and escapes in the early morning hours. She later saves Batman's life and the ensuing events help clear Catwoman's name as she actually took the fall for her friend and fellow orphan, Holly. 13. HUSH 2002's \"Hush\" written by Jeph Loeb saw a mysterious enemy from Bruce Wayne's past return to haunt the Dark Knight while also featuring an onslaught of classic Batman villains. Batman and Catwoman get hot and heavy pretty quickly after Bruce frees Selina from Poison Ivy's control. Bruce finally decides he should fully trust Selina and even reveals his secret identity to Catwoman in Batman #615! The two would team-up to fight not only Ivy, but also Harley Quinn, the Joker, and Superman as well throughout \"Hush .\" After defeating a faux Jason Todd reveals the arc's true mastermind, Bruce's childhood friend, Hush (a.k.a. Thomas Eliot) Batman's trust in himself is shaken. Was their love just a form of Ivy's control? Scarecrow's fear toxin? Can Bruce keep Selina safe? The Bat and the Cat end things. For now. 12. THE LONG HALLOWEEN Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's iconic noir masterpiece \"The Long Halloween\" tells the story of Harvey Dent's fall as Batman, <mark>Gordon</mark>, and Dent attempt to take down the Falcone crime family early in Batman's career. Catwoman has her own reasons for wanting to bring down Falcone and her information leads to the destruction of the mob's secret stash of dough worth tens of millions of dollars. Throughout the story, Batman attempts to not only end Falcone, but also to understand Catwoman's seemingly personal connection to the crime family. Two-Face, a.k.a. Harvey Dent, finally murders Falcone at his estate flanked by the \"freaks\" and villains of Gotham, including Catwoman. The Cat attempts to fend off his daughter Sofia, but the enraged mob heiress is horribly injured after she plummets out the window. \"The Long Halloween\" and its sequels also imply that Selina is Carmine's illegitimate child. 11. FOREVER EVIL The 2013 DC crossover event \"Forever Evil\" saw the heroes and villains of Earth Prime attacked and brought low by the machinations of the Crime Syndicate and their allies. After the Justice League gets thoroughly owned by the Syndicate and imprisoned by Deathstorm within the Firestorm Matrix, Batman takes Catwoman to the Batcave as they prepare a counterattack in Forever Evil #4. Catwoman and Batman soon find themselves in for the fight of their lives after running into Lex Luthor's own team of villains as well as Power Ring's gang of baddies. Luthor teams-up with the Cat and the Bat and this new \"Injustice League\" confronts the Syndicate and the \"Mazahs\" - shouting Alexander Luthor at the Watchtower in a bloody final battle, defeating the Crime Syndicate for the time being. 10. HEART OF HUSH Written by <mark>Paul Dini</mark> and illustrated by Dustin Nguyen, Hush makes a horrific return in \"Heart of Hush\" by kidnapping Catwoman and surgically removing her heart. Selina Kyle is kept alive on a series of machines while Batman pursues Hush to defeat his childhood friend and secure Catwoman's heart. Their battle spills over to the Batcave and, in a shocking twist, Elliot reveals that he's performed plastic surgery on his face in order to resemble Bruce Wayne. Fortunately, Batman, Robin, and Nightwing overcome Hush and are able to save Selina's life. In Detective Comics #850, Bruce visits Selina in the hospital and tells her that he'll always love her. Catwoman takes her revenge on Hush by stealing his entire fortune and enjoys a well-deserved vacation on Thomas Elliot's dime. 9. BATMAN: PREY \"Prey,\" which consisted of Legends of the Dark Knight #11 through #15, explored more of the characters' early history. At the story's start, Batman is still a very controversial figure in Gotham and is distrusted by the police force and the public. Dr. Hugo Strange becomes a G.C.P.D. consultant and begins to unravel the mystery behind Batman's identity. However, while chatting with a female mannequin, Strange quickly reveals that he's actually a highly intelligent, but extremely weird, wacko who is obsessed with Batman. Meanwhile, Catwoman is accused by the media of being Batman's partner in crime, so the two do not meet on the best of terms. Catwoman bashes Batman with a pipe after being attacked by Strange's hypnotized, faux-Batman replacement. That's what qualifies as a fun date on the streets of Gotham. 8. BATMAN: TERROR A sequel to \"Prey,\" Legends of the Dark Knight #137 begins the \"Terror\" arc which sees Hugo Strange return from the dead to torment Batman with the help of Scarecrow. It also tries really, really hard to make every single part of the story burst with sex appeal. Strange becomes the chief psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum and breaks Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. the Scarecrow, out while Batman is thoroughly schooled by Catwoman after attempting to bring her in for robbery. When Bruce returns home, he finds Alfred taken hostage by Strange and that the good doctor believes Bruce Wayne is Batman! Unfortunately, the reinvigorated Scarecrow has other plans and blackmails Selina into luring Bruce back to the place it all began: the Monarch Theater. Catwoman decides she'd rather bet on Batman to take Scarecrow down and her carefully placed homing device leads the Dark Knight to the fear-mongering psychopath. 7. ONLY TAKES A NIGHT Writer Ed Brubaker's Catwoman #32 opens with Selina Kyle's return to Gotham City. Almost immediately upon her arrival Batman shows up to once again confess his feelings for her. Selina convinces Bruce to take a \"night off\" and they share dinner and a movie like a normal couple for once. Bruce is so happy to find Selina alive after all this time that he actually almost breaks down in tears. #32 focuses on exploring a time when Bruce and Selina are able to have a healthy and happy relationship. It shows how their feelings for one another help to mitigate the pain from the challenges from the war against crime in Gotham City. Selina has, for a moment at least, balance and fulfillment in her life and relationship with Bruce, both in and out of the mask. 6. A TOWN ON THE NIGHT After the conclusion of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths,\" Batman #392 opens with Catwoman and Batman teaming-up to stop some run-of-the-mill baddies as Selina is still convincing the G.C.P.D. that she's reformed since her jewel-snatching days. To celebrate, Batman takes Catwoman for a bite at his favorite late-night spot: the back alley of an Italian restaurant. But since it's Gotham City and no one can get through a meal without a crime being committed, Catwoman and Batman apprehend an assassin who whacks someone at the restaurant. A pattern begins to form after this, as everywhere they go there's crime to be stopped! Finally, they show up at <mark>Jim Gordon</mark>'s office and present the apprehended criminals--and a mountain of pizza--as a gift to the police commissioner. 5. THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD \"The Autobiography of Bruce Wayne!\" tells the tale of when Bruce first fell in love with Selina Kyle back in The Brave and the Bold #197. In Bruce's memoirs, he even refers to Selina as \"his wife!\" Plagued by the haunting memories of all the loves lost in his crusade as Batman and unable to contact any of his crime-fighting allies in a pinch, Bruce seeks out the help of Catwoman in order to apprehend Scarecrow. Batman and Catwoman prove themselves a spectacular crime-fighting duo as they overcome a series of challenges set forth by Scarecrow all the while realizing how powerful their connection really is, and how they can escape their pain and loneliness together. After suffering a blast of fear toxin that causes Batman to be afraid of cats and Catwoman of bats, Selina breaks the poison's grip by revealing her face, which prompts Bruce to do the same. 4. SECRET ORIGINS DC Superstars #17 threw some new secret origins at readers including the Huntress, daughter of Earth-2's Batman and Catwoman! In this universe, Catwoman had willingly surrendered to the G.C.P.D. and served out a prison sentence as punishment for her crimes. When she was finally freed and totally not scarred by prison, Bruce Wayne was waiting with open arms. Bruce's marriage to Selina was a happy and fulfilling one and his crusade as the Batman even took a backseat once their daughter, Helena, was born. The fairy tale ends when a criminal from Selina's past blackmails her after revealing evidence that she murdered someone as Catwoman. Knowing that Bruce would never forgive her, she agrees to take on one last job. Selina's accidental death during Bruce's fight with the criminal inspires Helena to become the Huntress. 3. HEAT A cat-costumed serial killer with Wolverine-like claws stalks the streets of Gotham during a heat wave in Legends of the Dark Knight #46, so Batman reluctantly teams up with Catwoman to stop him. Selina springs into action once she hears that the media is suggesting a connection to her own alter-ego, and soon the cat-killer begins targeting young women. If that isn't enough, <mark>Jim Gordon</mark> punches the racist mayor in the face and race riots start to rage across the city because of the serial killer. Selina, wearing revealing civilian clothes, lures the killer to attack her in the park where she and Batman send him scampering to the Gotham City Zoo and finally take him down at the Miss Gotham Beauty Pageant. Afterwards, Batman makes a big to-do about their partnership officially being over forever, but everyone knows how serious he was about that! 2. BATMAN INC.. After Batman and Catwoman steal a weapon called Project X from a Leviathan compound they travel to Japan (Selina under a pseudonym) to train Mr. Unknown as a Japanese Batman. But after finding Mr. Unknown murdered, Bruce takes on Unknown's protege to stop Lord Death Man from killing his way through Japan's superhero population. Catwoman is instrumental in Lord Death Man's defeat...by running him over in a truck. Thanks to their teamwork, Bruce's mission to spread his vision of Batman Inc. to Japan in issues #1 and #2 is a success. Selina's side mission in Japan--stealing the Crown Jewels of Poseidon--is foiled when Bruce reveals that the jewels have liquefied, as they cannot survive above a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres. Sure. Makes sense, Brucie. 1. DETECTIVE COMICS In Detective Comics #569 Catwoman is still trying to convince Batman that she's reformed, even turning in the members of her former gang when they continue to commit crimes. The Joker lures Batman, Catwoman, and Jason Todd, a.k.a. Robin, into a trap before capturing and torturing Selina Kyle. She's no damsel in distress, however. \"Recalibrated\" and suffering from amnesia due to the Joker's torture device, Catwoman attacks Batman. This \"new\" Selina turns on the Joker too and seems to have completely forgotten her feelings for the Dark Knight. Joker gets a few nasty cracks to the jaw from Batman for that, as the infuriated Bruce laments about how the likes of the Joker have cost him every woman he's ever loved. Doubtful, Dark Knight, because although Selina returns to her criminal ways, she won't be out of your love-life for long! Let us know in the comments which Batman and Catwoman pairing is your favorite!

Much to the dismay of left-wing Democrats and their allies in the legacy press, Sessions shot down the notion that he somehow colluded with Russians during the 2016 election. He swatted away theories that he recused himself from the collusion investigation because he may have done something wrong. He displayed just the right amount of righteous indignation in defending his honor to come across as a trustworthy figure. As former CIA counterterrorism official Philip Mudd, who has viciously criticized President Donald Trump and his administration, conceded on CNN, Sessions \"wins this round .\" \"He didn't lay facts on the ground that could be disputed,\" Mudd said. \"I didn't see anything today that suggested that Sessions did anything illegal. I think he wins this round .\" CNN's <mark>John King</mark> said that \"unless facts surface to the contrary,\" Sessions \"helped himself quite a bit and rebutted the notion that he was involved in some type of collusion .\" Wolf Blitzer said Sessions made a \"strong case why he should recuse himself .\" CNN's Jeffrey Toobin said because Sessions did not answer questions about his conversations with Trump without citing executive privilege, the White House \"had its cake and ate it too .\" CNN's Gloria Borger agreed. CNN's David Chalian said when Sessions spoke about his \"meeting\" with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Sessions was \"quite adamant\" and \"dispatched\" with \"that whole Mayflower meeting .\" He also gave Sessions high marks on his testimony regarding his recusal from the collusion investigation. And even on left-wing MSNBC, Ari Melber conceded that Sessions \"did well\" in his \"legal performance\" and played a bad hand very well. Sessions: Russia Collusion Charge \"Appalling and Detestable Lie' In his introductory remarks, Sessions emphatically denied that he colluded with Russian officials in any way during the 2016 election, saying that charge was\" an appalling and detestable lie. \"He also disputed reports that he met with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC in 2016 .\" Let me state this clearly, colleagues. I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States, \"Sessions said .\" Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. \"Sessions: It's an\" appalling and detestable lie \"that he would collude with a foreign power https: //t.co/pDkbqXXKN7 #SessionsHearing pic.twitter.com/0qU3XGtfe0--Bloomberg (@ business) June 13, 2017 Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) boosted Sessions' case when, after asking Sessions if he enjoys spy novels, Cotton asked,\" Have you ever...in any of these fantastical situations heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage? \"Sessions replied that it\" is just like through the looking glass. I mean, what is this? I explained how in good faith I said I had not met with Russians, because they were suggesting I as a surrogate had been meeting continuously with Russians. \"\"I said I didn't meet with them and now, the next thing you know I'm accused of some reception plotting some sort of influence campaign for the American election,\" he added. \"It's just beyond my capability to understand .\" Addressing reports that he may have met privately with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel, Sessions insisted, \"I did not have any private meetings, nor do I recall any conversations, with any Russian officials at the Mayflower hotel .\" Sessions said he did not \"attend any meetings separately prior to\" Trump's speech that day. \"I attended a reception with my staff, that included at least two dozen people and President Trump, though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, and I do not have recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian ambassador or any other Russian officials,\" he said. \"If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian ambassador in that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media. There was an area for that in a different room and then I left the hotel. Whether I attended a reception where the Russian ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign .\" Sessions Says He Recused Himself to Follow Law Sessions made it clear that he did not recuse himself from the FBI's Russia investigation because he was under investigation or did something wrong. He adamantly made the case that he was simply following the law. \"Many have suggested that my recusal is because I felt I was a subject of the investigation myself, I may have done something wrong,\" he said. \"This is the reason I recused myself: I felt I was required to under the rules of the Department of Justice and as a leader of the Department of Justice, I should comply with the rules obviously .\" AG #Sessions on why he recused himself from #Russia investigation: \"I felt I was required to under the rules of the Department of Justice .\" pic.twitter.com/gheQdM8q6m--CSPAN (@ cspan) June 13, 2017 Sessions added that he recused himself \"not because of any asserted wrongdoing\" on his part during the campaign but \"because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it .\" \"That regulation states, in effect, that [Justice Department] employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign adviser,\" he said. Addressing the criticism that he may have improperly recommended that Comey be fired after his recusal, Sessions said that it is \"absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render the attorney general unable to manage the leadership of the various department of justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations .\" He said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein believed that when Comey \"declined the Clinton prosecution, that was really a usurpation of the authority of the federal prosecutors in the Department of Justice. It was a stunning development .\" Sessions said he ultimately determined that \"a fresh start at FBI was the appropriate thing to do .\" He added that \"there were other things that had happened that indicated to me a lack of discipline and it caused controversy on both sides of the aisle and I had come to the conclusion that a fresh start was appropriate and did not mind putting that in writing .\" Sessions Challenges Comey's Testimony Comey testified that he did not receive \"any kind of memorandum issued from the attorney general or the Department of Justice to the FBI outlining the parameters of\" Sessions' recusal, but Sessions countered on Tuesday by saying that his chief of staff sent an email to Comey about his recusal. \"On the date of my formal recusal, my chief of staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not,\" Sessions said. Sessions also challenged Comey's account in which Comey said Sessions did not respond when Comey said he was uncomfortable being alone with Trump. In fact, Sessions said Comey never told him why he was uncomfortable in the first place. \"Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the president,\" Sessions said. \"I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House .\" Sessions added that Comey \"could have complained to the deputy or to me at any time that he felt pressure,\" but did not do so. AG Sessions gives testimony about conversation where former FBI Director Comey expressed concern about communications with the White House. pic.twitter.com/4BExYbOQyU--ABC News (@ ABC) June 13, 2017 Citing \"Longstanding Position of Department of Justice,' Sessions Doesn't Disclose Confidential Communications with Trump Democrat after Democrat asked Sessions about his conversations with Trump, and Sessions never budged, citing\" longstanding policy \"at the Department of Justice. Establishment media reporters and Democrats sensed that this line of questioning was where Sessions--or someone else associated with Trump--could be put in legal limbo, but Sessions did not give them anything. He declined to answer Sen. Dianne Feinstein's (D-CA) questions about his potential meetings with Trump. He told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) that,\" I am not stonewalling. I am following the historic policies of the Department of Justice. \"\"You don't walk into hearing or committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with the President of the United States who is entitled to receive conventional communications in your best judgment about a host of issues and have to be accused of stonewalling them,\" he said. When Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) accused Sessions of impeding and obstructing the investigation, Sessions said, \"I am telling the truth in answering your question and saying it's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice to make sure that the president has full opportunity to decide these issues .\" When Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) interrogated him to try to enhance her national profile, Sessions said, \"I have some appreciation for as far as having spent 15 years in the Department of Justice, 12 as United States attorney, and that principle is that the Constitution provides the head of the executive branch certain privileges and...one of them is confidentiality of communications, and it is improper for agents of any of...any departments in the executive branch to waive that privilege without a clear approval of the president .\" AG Sessions declines to answer whether he discussed Comey's handling of Russia probe with Pres. Trump https: //t.co/rYsOYVGAu6 pic.twitter.com/DthE32wUtq--ABC News Politics (@ ABCPolitics) June 13, 2017 Sessions Defends Honor with Righteous Indignation, Comes Across as Trustworthy Perhaps most importantly, Sessions came across as credible while addressing his former colleagues. It is worth noting that many mainstream media reporters pointed out that even senators who disagreed with Sessions on issues like immigration did not question his trustworthiness during his tenure in the Senate. \"I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, at least some of you. And the suggestion that I participated in any collusion that I was aware of, any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process is an appalling and detestable lie,\" Sessions said. When Wyden, echoing Comey, kept insisting that Sessions may be hiding the real--and nefarious--reason for his recusal, Sessions again showed his righteous indignation, thunderously saying that, \"this is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me, and I don't appreciate it. I try to give my best and truthful answers to any committee I've appeared before, and...people are suggesting through innuendo that I have been not honest about matters, and I've tried to be honest .\" Earlier, Sessions had said that, \"I recused myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations .\" At the end of the day, even CNN's <mark>King</mark> had to give Sessions high marks on \"personal integrity\" and \"trustworthiness .\" VIDEO: AG Sessions bristles at questions about why he recused himself from Trump-Russia probe. https: //t.co/yrCNCoH02A pic.twitter.com/3CGJeOJJRT--AP Politics (@ AP_Politics) June 13, 2017", "articleID": "2017061403_00401834_W", "names": {"John King": ["Q11169832", "Q11728008", "Q12320190", "Q1232745", "Q15460643", "Q16018812", "Q16237828", "Q17859802", "Q18043577", "Q18626490", "Q19665420", "Q21461592", "Q22095928", "Q27958442", "Q30597402", "Q57312040", "Q6234532", "Q6239042", "Q6243110", "Q6243113", "Q6243117", "Q6243127", "Q6243129", "Q6243132", "Q6243134", "Q6243136", "Q6252241", "Q671520"]}}, {"date": "2017-06-14", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/environment/2017/06/14/bringing-balloons-down-earth-bill-would-end-mass-release/375533001/", "content": "Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Environmentalists push for N.J. balloon ban.

(Photo: File photo) Buy Photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Intentionally releasing helium-filled balloons as part of celebrations, remembrances or any organized event could soon be illegal in New Jersey. A bill introduced last month and making its way through the legislature bans the release of balloons because they are a significant source of litter when they fall to the ground, can be a danger around power lines and threaten sea turtles and other wildlife that mistake balloons for food. But a ban won't come without a fight. Representatives for the balloon lobby plan to meet with the bill's sponsor--Sen. <mark>Jim Whelan</mark>, D-Atlantic--to persuade him to drop the measure. The Trenton-based Balloon Council beat back a similar attempt in New Jersey three decades ago and has spent more than $1 million in the past five years lobbying legislators against regulations, state records show. The group, a coalition of balloon manufacturers and retailers, has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past few years defeating proposed bans across the nation. The bans \"are a threat to a lot of mom and pop businesses in the balloon industry,\" said Dale Florio of Princeton Public Affairs, the powerful Trenton lobbying group that represents the Balloon Council. \"It creates a negative narrative about balloons, which is unfounded .\" But the idea has taken hold again in New Jersey. Recently, bans have been enacted in a handful of municipalities along the Shore, including Atlantic City. <mark>Whelan</mark>'s bill is similar to those bans. Advocacy groups, including the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions and Hackensack Riverkeeper, have begun lobbying towns in North Jersey to enact similar measures. \"Having it town by town is spotty,\" <mark>Whelan</mark> said. \"If another town allows balloon releases, it really doesn't take care of the problem. A statewide ban does .\" Buy Photo Balloon releases are done at a myriad of events. Here a girl releases a balloon in 2013 at the Feast of Saint Joseph at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Lodi. (Photo: File photo) <mark>Whelan</mark>, who introduced the bill on May 15, said he has already been contacted by lobbyists for the council and said he will entertain a meeting with them to discuss the bill. Violators could be fined up to $500 under the bill. Although balloon releases have long been common at celebrations and public memorials, there has been a push nationwide to stop the practice. States like Connecticut and Florida have banned the release of 10 or more balloons at one time. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service says balloons are a real threat to animals. The agency has urged people not to release balloons and has even posted grisly photos of dead birds and a turtle on a webpage. In recent months, Atlantic City, Margate, Ventnor and Longport have passed bans at the urging of environmental groups concerned about the coastal impact. Buy Photo Friends and family release 42 balloons in 2013 at a vigil in North Bergen near the site of a hit-and-run accident. (Photo: File photo) And with graduation season underway, PSE & G recently reminded its customers not to release foil balloons because they can drift into electric lines and cause power outages. The metal foil can cause a short circuit. The Balloon Council has argued that the threat to wildlife has been blown out of proportion. Although latex balloons can be found tangled in trees or littering beaches, they have not risen to the level of common litter like bottles and cans, the council says. This is not the first time a statewide ban was proposed. In 1989, the state Assembly unanimously passed a bill that prohibited all but scientists from releasing more than 10 helium balloons a day. But the Balloon Council lobbied against the measure, which died in the Senate. \"Policymakers have been very appreciative of the efforts put forward by the industry,\" Florio said.
