roamed deep caverns and wedged himself into frighteningly small places to see what was in there, i was all bated breath and nerves, rather quickly followed by wonderment at what nature can do. but of course, as we've seen in haiti, nature and all its wonders can turn on us planet dwellers. gaia might be saying\" get off my land \"when she oversees the shifting of tectonic plates or issues forth blistering heat from subterranean fissures. however, events in haiti made this programme infinitely more topical than it might otherwise have been, which may well have attracted more viewers, and that

fissures and other holes in the earth. in mexico, he bravely went into what is arguably the world's most inhospitable and least welcoming cave system. he had to wear a cooling suit and carry an oxygen tank, for despite the beauty to be found in those caves, he would've died in minutes without that kit. much reference was made to the minoans of crete and their early influence on what geology has become. we also saw that in their spare time, they liked nothing more than a spot of bull-vaulting. as you do. there was one rather amusing moment for me when <mark>iain</mark> asked,\" how do you

an issue now that i've seen him clambering into the caves mentioned above and into abandoned mines and some seriously scary potholes. but his reward is in the flora that resides often miles beneath or

majors the wichita eagle this is not the age of pianos. this is the age of the economic meltdown, recession, shrinking retirement savings, catastrophic budget cuts and government bailouts, followed by public outrage at bailouts. pianos? no. but at the music department at wichita state university on thursday, the piano fleet arrived. ten new yamaha p22s. music students and teachers stared at them happily. sterling gray, a guitarist and a teacher, caressed the keys. \"this is so great,\" he said. at a time when education budgets are being gutted, a time when pianos look like quaint luxuries, a group of small-gift donors banded together in the past three years. they bought or pledged to buy 21 new yamaha pianos to replace 26 exhausted, half-century-old pianos in the music department at wsu that have been played morning, noon and night since the 1950s. they hope to replace the other five played-out pianos soon. how they did it and why is a story that ought to have a soundtrack put to it. about three years ago, wsu music alums including denny senseney - a tuba player who had to play those old pianos in duerksen fine arts center to get his music degree back in the 1960s - found out that the 26 pianos were wearing out; it was embarrassing how sour they sounded. there are 350 music students there now; semester after semester every student had to play to pass. even if they played tuba, they had to take piano classes to get their music degrees. they played beethoven and gershwin to pass, played beatles for pleasure; they played all day and night, hundreds of students every semester going into soundproof rooms and stroking keys. one keyboard was missing six keys. the pianos all sounded tinny; most of them couldn't be tuned anymore. senseney and other friends of wsu got their heads together. kelly callen, a co-owner of edmiston oil co., wasn't a music major. \"i was more fine arts; but i had volunteered at the zoo where we'd done some good by asking donors to adopt an animal,\" she said. \"so i said why not try to get people to adopt a piano, and see whether we could get 26 pianos .\" they've almost done it; <mark>john paul</mark> johnson, the director of the music department, put 10 new yamahas on display in the hallway at duerksen fine arts center on thursday. they already had received a shipment of five; pledges will bring the total of new pianos to 21. \"i almost can't believe this is happening,\" he said, as gray played a few quiet notes beside him. senseney, who is retired from senseney music, said callen's idea worked well. most of the donors, he said, are patrons of the arts in wichita, some of them graduates of wsu's school of music. one pair of names on one of the adopted pianos on display thursday: wsu president don beggs and his wife, shirley, a voice major in her college days. other donors include a family who donated to honor their mother and another family who donated to honor a family member and wsu music major killed in vietnam. senseney, callen, johnson and others arranged a price for the pianos that they hoped would help attract donors; yamaha, the manufacturer, and senseney music agreed to sell the pianos for half of their usual $10,000 price. what this means, johnson said, is that the music department that has given the world thousands of music teachers and musicians and music lovers is going to continue to do so, while sounding a lot sweeter in those soundproof rooms. receptionist mid america orthopedics us-ks-wichita therapy aide kansas orthopaedic ctr us-ks-wichita accountant the mccall pattern company

(ap) - a company that manufacturers sustainable building products for the construction industry is moving to the gallup area, which state officials claimed as proof they're making good on their word to bring more jobs to new mexico's rural areas. gov. <mark>bill richardson</mark> gathered economic development officials at the state capitol on thursday to announce that c/d2 enterprises is setting up shop north of gallup. the company plans to start manufacturing this spring and will hire about 40 workers over the next three years. \"these are exactly the kinds of jobs that we're working to attract to new mexico, especially in the more rural parts of the state,\" the governor said. \"our doors are open. new mexico is open for business .\" <mark>richardson</mark> used the opportunity to send a message to legislators meeting for a 30-day session to continue supporting tax credits and other incentives that attract companies and jobs. \"these are working, they're bringing jobs,\" <mark>richardson</mark> said of the incentives. \"let's not mess with these .\" despite the economic downturn and the state's budget woes, the governor said the state has announced 200 jobs for rural new mexico in recent weeks and plans to announce an additional 100 soon for southeastern new mexico. he declined tooffer additional details. <mark>richardson</mark>'s administration contends the incentives are responsible in part for creating jobs and keeping the state's unemployment rate below the national level. new mexico's unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in november, unchanged from the previous month but up from 4.6 percent a year ago. the national rate is around 10 percent. statistics from new mexico's labor department show, however, that job growth in new mexico has declined by 3 percent over the past year, representing a loss of more than 25,000 jobs. new mexico is not alone. all states have reported declines in job growth over the past year, the department said. state lawmakers are being cautious as they consider how to deal with a $600 million budget shortfall while being pressured by the administration and industry groups to continue providing tax credits and other incentives. sen. eric griego, d-albuquerque, said the state must ensure it is getting a return on its investment. \"the problem isn't whether or not these incentives work. the problem is...there is no way of quantifying how much the incentives are costing per job created and retained,\" he said. griego said the incentives are beneficial when companies pay a living wage, offer benefits and have a long-term commitment to staying in the community. when companies pay low wages and have no commitment, griego said: \"frankly, they're just using the taxpayer .\" the owners of c/d2 enterprises said their jobs will pay as much as $23 per hour and they are committed to the gallup community. the location near interstate 40 allows quick transport of their products to military bases and other customers in the southwest. state officials said the company is benefiting from more than $367,000 in job training funds, capital outlay money and high-wage tax credits.", "articleID":

need,\" said first sargent rob farnsworth, part of a u.s. army airborne unit handing out food packs at a squalid camp where survivors lived in the open air. up to 1.5 million haitians lost their homes in the jan. 12 earthquake that rocked the small caribbean country, devastated its capital port-au-prince and killed up to 200,000. relief agencies estimated one-third of haiti's nine million people would need emergency food, water and shelter for an extended period. haitians struggled to find food, water and medical care. even those whose homes withstood the magnitude 7 quake were too traumatized by aftershocks to sleep under a roof. there were signs of daily life resuming. taptaps, haiti's small, colorfully decorated private buses, circulated in port-au-prince, sharing streets with the earth-movers and digging machines clearing debris. banks were scheduled to reopen on saturday and money transfer agencies did brisk business after opening on friday. \"i want to get some cash sent by my family from canada. it's $500 but it's difficult. there are so many people,\" said businessman aslyn denis, 31, waiting in a line with hundreds of people, some of them jostling each other, outside a unitransfer office. the dead body of a young man lay in a street, his head swollen and bloody. residents said he tried to steal money and was stoned by a crowd. he wore socks but his shoes were gone and his pockets had been pulled out. edmond mulet, acting head of the u.n. peacekeeping mission in haiti, said coordination in delivering aid was getting better every day. the world food program distributed 1.2 million food rations to hospitals and orphanages on thursday and hoped to give out 10 million in the next week. \"we may be able to scale up even quicker,\" said josette sheeran, executive director of the u.n. world food program. \"we finally have supplies and food coming in from all over the world .\" the seaport in port-au-prince was repaired enough to partially reopen for cargo ships, while airstrips outside the capital and in the dominican republic received relief flights. but nearly 1,000 hungry people swarmed a u.s. military truck as an 82nd airborne company known as \"the beast\" handed out food and water at an encampment on a soccer field. overwhelmed, the troops pulled out after distributing 600 packaged meals, leaving 250 food packs still on the truck. a large supermarket, big star market, reopened in the petionville suburb on friday, selling everything from slabs of ham and goat meat to valentine's day chocolates. but the store manager said they had only a week or two of stocks left and had received no deliveries. haitians are realizing it could take months or years to regain some sense of normalcy. \"we want it to be over, but it's not finished yet, things are bad,\" said jeanette, a 53-year-old architect shopping at the market. \"i've lost my office. i've lost a whole year of work. we have no stability, no direction, we've been left to fend for ourselves. we can't plan for the future, we're just living day-to-day .\" the united nations counted nearly 450 encampments in port-au-prince alone where the homeless huddle, cook and sleep amid mounds of garbage. more than $1.2-billion has been pledged to help rebuild roads, government buildings and homes, but the world bank said much more would be needed to get haiti on its feet. \"my anticipation is that $1.2-billion is just the floor,\" the bank's director for the caribbean, yvonne tsikata, told france 24 television. the international monetary fund urged donors gathering in montreal next week to adopt a marshall plan for haiti, similar to the u.s. effort that helped rebuild europe after the second world war. \"it is not unrealistic to imagine that the country can be rebuilt as a prosperous nation. but it needs help over a prolonged period,\" imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn wrote on the huffington post. u.s. navy helicopters ferried in boxes of water to distribute to haitians lined up at a sprawling camp that covered a golf course. actor sean penn stopped by to deliver antibiotics, painkillers and water filters. \"the whole city has collapsed,\" he said. u.s. troops were giving away 50,000 solar - and crank-powered radios to help displaced haitians receive announcements telling them where aid was available. more than 13,000 u.s. military personnel are in haiti and on ships offshore, flying in supplies, evacuating the seriously wounded and protecting aid distribution points. the united nations is adding 2,000 troops and 1,500 police to its 9,000-member peacekeeping mission. but for many, life remained precarious. at another camp in port-au-prince, a woman tried not to moan in pain as a student doctor bandaged her badly-injured leg. in the dirty tent where he worked, cooking pots bubbled and a dog slept inches from the open wound. \"of course there is the risk of infection,\" said alexi guyto, 26. \"for the most part, we have lost the people who came with major traumas after the earthquake but we still have lots of head and other injuries .\" supplies from b.c. residents reaches haiti orphanage an american soldier
