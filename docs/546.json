On Friday (August 2), Kim Farry joined hosts <mark>Ben Shephard</mark> and Rochelle Humes in the studio to talk about her profitable life as a shoplifter. She claims to have stolen goods worth \u00a3 2million (Credit: ITV) Read more: Harry Judd's wife Izzy admits to guilt over finding motherhood hard after fertility issues and miscarriage And it wasn't the first time she had appeared on the show. Kim, who now says she has turned over a new leaf, claims her illegal lifestyle allowed her to wear designer clothes, drive expensive cars and go on endless holidays. Her 45-year shoplifting habit once saw her \"earn' up to \u00a3 20,000 pounds a month - two million pounds in total! She told <mark>Ben</mark> and Rochelle:\" In the end, because I was so good at it, it was just a business. Like you've got a job, I've got a job. \"Kim now wants to help others escape crime (Credit: ITV) Read more: Mum of brain-damaged Tafida Raqeeb pleads with doctors to let her live She also admitted she became so successful at stealing that she began to employ other people to go back to stores with de-tagged stolen goods and get money back for them. However, after serving five prison sentences, Kim has now decided to leave it all behind for the sake of her daughter Paris who\" wanted a normal life \". What's with this interview? Feels like it's glamorising shoplifting? Completely inappropriate! She has now written a book about her crimes, with part of the fee going to charity she says, which she discussed with the This Morning hosts. But fans weren't happy about her appearance on the show at all, and accused them of\" glamorising \"criminality. What's with this interview? Feels like its glamourising shoplifting? Getting a step by step on how to do it too. Completely inappropriate. #ThisMorning--Sian Humphreys (@ Sian_humphreys) August 2, 2019 Why put this woman on again. Giving a vile thief airtime.

(Photo: Donna Burton/CBP/cc) In a letter Thursday to Acting Homeland Security Secretary <mark>Kevin McAleenan</mark>, 33 House Democrats demanded that U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost resign over her participation in a secret Facebook group in which members of the federal agency shared racist, sexist, and violent comments about migrants and members of Congress. Early last month, ProPublica reported on a Facebook group called \"I'm 10-15,\" which references the Border Patrol code for \"aliens in custody .\" Created in August of 2016, the group had nearly 10,000 members who were currently or formerly employed by the Department of Homeland Security. Just days after the initial report, The Intercept's Ryan Devereaux revealed that Provost was a member of the group. The nearly three dozen lawmakers, including Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Susan Wild (Penn.), charged in their letter (pdf) to <mark>McAleenan</mark> that Provost \"has lost the public's confidence that she can faithfully execute the responsibilities of her position without bias or prejudice .\" They wrote in part: Ms. Provost was a willing participant in a secret Facebook group used by employees of her agency to share [contemptible] and atrocious commentary that stokes racist and xenophobic tropes that have no place in private, much less in public service. The Facebook group, originally known as \"I'm 10-15,\" generated content that joked about migrant deaths and throwing burritos at Members of Congress, and even went so far as to make sexually violent and threatening statements about female members of Congress who came to the border to inspect the conditions at detention centers. We worry this content impugns the character of the U.S. Border Patrol as a whole. While Provost initially publicly expressed surprise about the group, promised that employees who participated would be held accountable, and said the DHS Inspector General's Office would be investigating the matter, the letter pointed out that \"conspicuously absent from her statement was an admission that she had been a member of the Facebook group for months .\" \"It is Ms. Provost's responsibility to discipline employees who fall under her agency's auspices, not participate in conduct unbecoming of her office,\" the lawmakers declared, calling on <mark>McAleenan</mark> \"to follow Ms. Provost's own promise of accountability, by immediately seeking her resignation .\" In a tweet announcing the letter, Pressley called Provost's participation in the group \"deeply disturbing and absolutely unacceptable .\" She wrote that if <mark>McAleenan</mark> \"has one ounce of dignity left, he'll demand her resignation immediately .\" The @ CBP Chief's participation in a group filled with racist & misogynistic attacks on Members of Congress & migrant families in her care is deeply disturbing & absolutely unacceptable. If @ DHSMcAleenan has one ounce of dignity left, he'll demand her resignation immediately. pic.twitter.com/PHrYythp4p--Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (@ RepPressley) August 1, 2019 The lawmakers, in the letter, also highlighted the humanitarian crisis at the U.S. Southern border--from the forcible separation of children from their parents to the inhumane conditions in which migrants have been detained. According to the letter Thursday, \"the callousness displayed in the Facebook group is matched only by the callous treatment of children detainees under Ms. Provost's watch .\" SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Get our best delivered to your inbox. \"The conditions at these detention centers--which include limited access to basic hygienic needs like showers, toothpaste, and clean clothes--are not just failures of sufficient funding, they are failures of leadership,\" the letter continued. \"These Facebook posts suggest that the culprit is not just lack of resources but a level of malice that has no place in the policing of our borders .\" In addition to Pressley and Wild, the letter was also signed by Democratic Reps. <mark>Karen Bass</mark> (Calif.), <mark>Steve Cohen</mark> (Tenn.), Madeleine Dean (Penn.), Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), Nanette Diaz Barragan (Calif.), Madeleine Dean (Penn.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), <mark>Dwight Evans</mark> (Penn.), <mark>Ruben Gallego</mark> (Ariz.), Sylvia Garcia (Texas), Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), Deb Haaland (N.M.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Barbara Lee (Calif.), Andy Levin (Mich.), Alan Lowenthal (Calif.), Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.), Tom Malinowski (N.J.), <mark>Jim McGovern</mark> (Mass.), Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), Frank Pallone (N.J.), <mark>Donald Payne</mark> Jr. (N.J.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), <mark>Bobby Rush</mark> (Ill.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), Darren Soto (Fla.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), <mark>Juan Vargas</mark> (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Texas), Nydia Velazquez (N.Y.), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J.). Read the full letter below: Dear Acting Secretary <mark>McAleenan</mark>: We, the undersigned Members of Congress, request that you immediately request the resignation of Carla Provost, Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, who has lost the public's confidence that she can faithfully execute the responsibilities of her position without bias or prejudice. Ms. Provost was a willing participant in a secret Facebook group used by employees of her agency to share contemptable and atrocious commentary that stokes racist and xenophobic tropes that have no place in private, much less in public service. The Facebook group, originally known as \"I'm 10-15,\" generated content that joked about migrant deaths and throwing burritos at Members of Congress, and even went so far as to make sexually violent and threatening statements about female members of Congress who came to the border to inspect the conditions at detention centers. We worry this content impugns the character of the U.S. Border Patrol as a whole. Earlier this month, Ms. Provost expressed surprise about the Facebook group at issue and publicly stated, \"[t] hese posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see--and expect--from our agents day in and day out .\" She also promised that \"[a] ny employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable .\" At that same time, she stated that she had alerted the DHS Inspector General's Office and an investigation would be launched. Conspicuously absent from her statement was an admission that she had been a member of the Facebook group for months--as evidenced by her comments on a particular post questioning her ascent to Chief--or an explanation as to why she hadn't already alerted DHS of the Facebook group. As Chief of U.S. Border Patrol it is Ms. Provost's responsibility to discipline employees who fall under her agency's auspices, not participate in conduct unbecoming of her office. It appears that to date CBP employees have only received cease and desist letters or been placed on administrative duties pending investigation--and only after the Facebook group came to light through news reports. For the avoidance of any doubt, the callousness displayed in the Facebook group is matched only by the callous treatment of children detainees under Ms. Provost's watch. The conditions at these detention centers--which include limited access to basic hygienic needs like showers, toothpaste, and clean clothes--are not just failures of sufficient funding, they are failures of leadership. These Facebook posts suggest that the culprit is not just lack of resources but a level of malice that has no place in the policing of our borders. As Members of Congress, we are committed to ensuring that those who occupy top positions in federal government are held to the highest standards. This is especially true of the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol, at a time when conditions at our southern border have reached a crisis point. As such, we urge you to follow Ms. Provost's own promise of accountability, by immediately seeking her resignation. Our work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.
