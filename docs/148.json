comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. by george georgiopoulos and lefteris papadimas athens (reuters) - greece successfully closed its bond swap offer to private creditors on thursday, opening the way to securing the funding it needs to avert a messy default on its debt, according to several senior officials. one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said take-up of bonds regulated by greek law, the most significant part of the overall debt, was around 95 percent. the official said the figure referred to the voluntary take-up of the offer, however another official said it assumed the activation of collective action clauses (cac) that would impose the deal on all creditors holding greek law bonds. the biggest sovereign debt restructuring in history will see bond holders accept losses of some 74 percent on the value of their investments in a deal that will cut more than 100 billion euros from greece's crippling public debt. preliminary results from the offer are expected to be announced officially at 0600 gmt on friday and will hold a news conference before a call with euro zone finance ministers in the afternoon. after initial fears that the deal could fail altogether, pitching greece and the euro zone into fresh crisis, the result provides a rare piece of good news for the government of. athens had said it would enforce the deal on all its bondholders, activating collective action clauses on the 177 billion euros worth of bonds regulated under greek law. that would potentially trigger payouts on the credit default swaps (cds) that some investors held on the bonds, an event which would have unknown consequences for the market. the so-called private sector involvement (psi) deal is a key element in a broader international bailout aimed at averting a chaotic default by greece and a potentially disastrous banking crisis across the euro zone. have made a successful bond swap a pre-condition for final approval of the 130 billion euros ($170 billion) bailout agreed last month. optimism despite the apparent success, the deal will not solve greece's deep-seated problems and at best it may buy time for a country facing its biggest economic crisis since world war two and crushed under debt equal to 160 percent of its gross domestic product. however financial markets rose strongly in the run-up to the deadline as the threat of an immediate and uncontrolled default receded. \"this does not mean the debt situation in greece is resolved, and this is not the last time we will be hearing about this. but it is a relief that it didn't go the other way. it could have been a lot worse,\" said tim ghriskey, chief investment officer at solaris group in new york. bank stocks rose sharply and the risk premium on italian and spanish government bonds fell as investors hoped a greek deal would curb the likelihood of any contagion spreading to other weaker euro zone economies. euro zone ministers could decide whether to clear the overall bailout package in their conference call on friday afternoon, although they may leave the final decision until a face-to-face meeting on monday. athens must have the funds in place by march 20 when some 14.5 billion euros of bonds are due, which it cannot hope to repay alone. greece has staggered from deadline to deadline since the crisis broke two years ago and several of its international partners have expressed open doubts about whether its second major bailout in two years will be the last. underlining the severe problems facing greece after five years of deep recession, data on thursday showed unemployment running at a record 21 percent in december, twice the euro zone average, with 51 percent of young people without a job. there has been growing resentment over the austerity medicine ordered by international creditors which has compounded the pain from a slump which has seen the economy shrink by a fifth since 2008. but greece, totally reliant on international support to stave off bankruptcy, has also infuriated both the european union and the international monetary fund with its repeated failure to push through promised reforms. \"we have shown a lot of solidarity with greece,\" german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said late on wednesday. \"everyone knows that the real problems of greek society are in greece and not abroad .\" ($1 = 0.7625 euros) <mark>min

writer updated 11:09 am friday, march 9, 2012 layoffs of 330 employees at appleton papers' west carrollton plant will begin in may, the company confirmed friday. appleton is implementing its recently announced paper supply agreement with domtar and is no longer referring to that agreement as \"tentative,\" bill van den brandt, a spokesman for the appleton, wisc.-based company, said. \"that adjective is being removed,\" van den brandt said. he could not give a more precise timeframe for when layoffs will start, but he said that will be the subject of talks set to start monday between appleton and the united steelworkers. on feb. 23, appleton first announced that it will lay off 330 workers at its 1030 w. alex bell road mill as it agrees to take base paper from domtar, a canadian producer that has supplied appleton for decades. about 100 workers will remain at the plant, pending an agreement with local 266 of the steelworkers, which represents local appleton workers, the company has said. the local plant would become a thermal paper coating facility. while there have been discussions so far between appleton and the union, talks on the \"effects\" of the company's decision will begin in earnest on monday, the company said. those talks will turn to worker severance packages, timeframes and more. \"it's really all about respecting the people involved,\" van den brandt said. <mark>jimmy allen</mark>, president of steelworkers local 266, agreed that company-union talks will now turn to how workers will be impacted. \"we're set to begin our effects bargaining this coming monday,\" he said. \"you can probably imagine,\" <mark>allen</mark> added when asked about the mood of workers at the plant. this week in a conference call with industry analysts, <mark>mark richards</mark>, appleton chairman, president and chief executive, said the steelworkers will not have \"veto power\" over the company's supply agreement with domtar or its decision to cut 330 jobs from the west carrollton plant. \"we intend to help all affected west carrollton mill employees make a smooth transition and we look forward to completing the effects bargaining process in a

against china's restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals that are critical to production of advanced technology and clean energy goods expected to provide the jobs of the future. \"we want our companies building those products right here in america. but to do that, american manufacturers need to have access to rare earth materials which china supplies,\" president barack obama said at the white house. \"now, if china would simply let the market work on its own, we'd have no objections. but their policies currently are preventing that from happening and they go against the very rules that china agreed to follow,\" obama said. he cast the decision to take action with the european union and japan at the world trade organization as part of stepped-up u.s. effort to make sure countries play by global trade rules. \"our competitors should be on notice. they will not get away with skirting the rules,\" obama said. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

^ ^ ^ ^ obama, a democrat, has been toughening his stance on chinese trade practices amid criticism from his republican rivals that his administration has not been strict enough with beijing, as he girds for his re-election fight for the white house this november. he also on tuesday signed a bipartisan bill that restores the u.s. ability to impose countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties on goods from china and other \"non-market economies\" after a court ruling struck the practice down. three against one the rare earths dispute is one of several between beijing and the other three economic powers, as chinese industry remolds the world economic order. the dispute is the first to be jointly filed by the european union, the united states and japan. though dependent on the outside world for vast qualities of industrial inputs such as iron and coal, china accounts for about 97 percent of world output of the 17 rare earth metals. they are crucial for the defense, electronics and renewable-energy industries and are used in a range of products such as mobile phones, disk drives, wind turbines and electric cars. \"china continues to make its export restraints more restrictive, resulting in massive distortions and harmful disruptions in supply chains for these materials throughout the global marketplace,\" u.s. trade representative ron kirk said. the action over china's export curbs involving rare earths, as well as tungsten and molybdenum, begins a 60-day process for the two sides to try to resolve the dispute. if unsuccessful, the next step would be for the united states, the european union and japan to ask the wto to establish a dispute-settlement panel to decide the case, which with appeals could take as long as two years. \"china's restrictions on rare earths and other products violate international trade rules and must be removed,\" european union trade commissioner karel de gucht said in a statement. \"these measures hurt our producers and consumers in the eu and across the world, including manufacturers of pioneering hi-tech and\" green' business applications. \"environmental defense beijing said the export curbs are necessary to control environmental problems caused by rare earth mining and to preserve supplies of an exhaustible natural resource .\" we regret their decision to complain to the wto, \"china's minister of industry and information technology <mark>miao wei</mark> said, according to the official xinhua news agency .\" in the meantime, we are actively preparing to defend ourselves. \"china's export quotas were not trade protectionism and did not target any specific country, he added. the eu, the united states and mexico won a similar case against china in january concerning other raw materials. but a european official close to the case said despite this ruling, china had not removed wider export restrictions. in particular, the eu said in a statement,\" the latest rare earth quota announcements are further tightening the restrictions and are a clear signal in the wrong direction. \"beijing has until the end of march to tell the united states, the eu and mexico how it intends to comply with the january ruling, providing an opportunity for china to address both that case and the rare earth restrictions at the same time, a senior u.s. administration official said. foreign companies pay up to twice as much as chinese firms for rare earth metals, the eu says .\" these restrictions...benefit chinese industry, \"the official said .\" therefore they are against wto rules. \"the eu directly imports 350 million euros worth of rare earths from china each year, and also brings in products of far greater value containing rare earths from japan and elsewhere. the damage done to european manufacturing runs into billions of euros, the official said because it was nearly impossible to diversify from chinese supply. china said its export policies stemmed from environmental concerns, but failed to prove its curbs helped conserve resources, cut pollution or improve public health in that case, the eu said. trade spats trade friction between the eu and china has been growing. de gucht said on a recent visit to hong kong that china needed to be sensitive to perceptions that its economy is a threat in europe, even as eu-china trade has boomed to almost 400 billion euros in 2010. eu complaints against chinese dumping range from shoes to kitchenware, and de gucht has previously complained that china subsidizes\" nearly everything \". meanwhile china, along with the united states and russia, recently complained about an eu plan to levy a carbon emissions charge on all airlines using eu airports. china has said it would not buy aircraft from european maker airbus because of the emissions scheme. japanese worries over supplies of rare earths heightened in 2010 when china held back shipments after a territorial dispute. in the united states, obama recently created a new inter-agency trade enforcement center, is expected to start work in the coming months with a focus on chinese honoring of wto rules. the obama administration is also considering a wto complaint against anti-dumping and retaliatory duties on u.s. auto exports that china imposed late last year.
