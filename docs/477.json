Mickey Welsh TUSCALOOSA--Given the tireless preparation Alabama's coaches go through in the buildup to games, it's not often that the top-ranked Crimson Tide defense gets surprised on Saturdays. But Arkansas found away to do just that last Saturday, utilizing a simple tight end screen to burn Alabama's usually stingy defense for a pair of first-half touchdown passes to junior Cheyenne O\u2019Grady in the closer-than-it-should've - been 65-31 loss. \"It was just how they ran it (that) surprised us,\" Tide sophomore nose guard Quinnen Williams admitted Tuesday. \"It looked just like a type of pass protection that we go over all the time. The quarterback held the ball almost like 3-4 seconds and then the tight ends just slipped out of the back .\" You see something new every game, something new every day, so it's (about) correcting it and getting it better so if we see it again, it won't happen again. \"Of course, with Missouri's potent offense coming to Tuscaloosa for Saturday's Homecoming game (6 p.m. CT, ESPN), including 6-foot-5 and 255-pound junior tight end Albert Okwuegbunam, who led all FBS tight ends last season with 11 receiving touchdowns. Missouri Tigers tight end Albert Okwuegbunam (81) celebrates after scoring a touchdown in the second quarter against the Arkansas Razorbacks at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium. Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports The Razorbacks took advantage of this particular tight end screen multiple times on its first touchdown drive, as O\u2019Grady began the play as a blocker against a blitzing outside linebacker before releasing and immediately turning around near the line of scrimmage to face quarterback Ty Storey for a quick pass over the middle. At that point, O\u2019Grady simply followed the blocks laid by Razorback offensive linemen already 5 yards downfield for an 11-yard completion across midfield. Storey and O\u2019Grady connected three times on that drive for 35 yards, including an 8-yard touchdown pass to the left corner of the end zone to pull within 21-7 of Alabama with 24 seconds left in the first quarter. O\u2019Grady led the Razorbacks with seven catches for 48 yards and the two touchdowns .\" A couple of those plays last week, I think three of them, are where the guy blocked, blocked, blocked, and we kind of released them in coverage, whoever had them, and then a lineman gets in between you and the tight end and they throw them a little screen, \"Tide head coach Nick Saban said Monday .\" We hadn't seen that play prior to last week's game. It didn't kill us in the game, but it is certainly something we need to defend better in the future. It is a difficult play and you have to be disciplined in coverage. \"Arkansas head coach Chad Morris and Alabama head coach Nick Saban chat at mid field before the Alabama vs. Arkansas game in Fayetteville, Ark., on Saturday October 6, 2018. Mickey Welsh In developing the game plan against Alabama last week, Arkansas head coach Chad Morris noticed how aggressive the Tide defensive front seven is, especially in the pass rush, and figured a delayed screen for the tight end could be just what can help even the odds .\" We felt like they were just aggressive up front, they give a lot of pressure, and did a really good job of retracing on any screen releases you had, so we tried to use that against them, \"Razorbacks head coach Chad Morris said Wednesday on the SEC teleconference .\" They're very sound and very well coached, so when you go against teams of that caliber, you try to do some things that maybe make a few of their keys lie to them. \"More: Tide defense seeks return to\" Alabama standard' against Mizzou More: Imperfect Alabama defense knows the buck stops with them For defensive linemen like Williams, the tight end's initial attempt at blocking at the line of scrimmage sent sure signals for a natural run or run-pass option play, but instead utilized those predetermined notions to catch Alabama off guard, even if it was only good for a series or two in the first half. \"We're all thinking,\" pass rush, pass rush, \"' Williams said .\" So when the tight end slipped out of the back, it was like, \"Woah .' I've never seen it before like that .' It was just a great game plan on Arkansas' behalf .\" Added sophomore middle linebacker Dylan Moses: \"That was something that I really didn't see on film. I'm pretty sure they looked at that as something that could hurt us and it did. We went in at halftime, game planned against it and fixed it .\" Of course, with Missouri (3-2, 0-2 SEC) and preseason Heisman Trophy contender Drew Lock bringing the Tigers' own innovative offense to town this Saturday, and senior receivers Nate Brown and Emanuel Hall still out with injuries, it's a safe bet first-year Tigers offensive coordinator <mark>Derek Dooley</mark> will try and find different ways to move the ball against No. 1 Alabama (6-0, 3-0 SEC), including taking advantage of a potential mismatch with the 6-5 Okwuegbunam at tight end. \"They have a prolific offense, (and) Drew Lock is hands down one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, if not the best,\" junior safety Deionte Thompson said Monday. \"The way that he can get the ball out of his hands is very fast. The way they move, they average a play every six seconds after the ball is snapped. They average the most plays in college football. It's going to be a fast-paced game. We have to get lined down, get the call, communicate and be ready to play .\" Missouri Tigers tight end Albert Okwuegbunam attempts to make a catch in the end zone as South Carolina Gamecocks defensive back Jaycee Horn defends in the second half at Williams-Brice Stadium.
