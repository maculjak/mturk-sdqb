His Jackson Northwest High School bowling coach, Gerry Lobdell, responded by saying, \"About time .\" The well-timed joke drew a dry smirk from Lewis, who had a spare the frame prior--and 15 straight strikes before that. Lewis, a senior, rolled the first 12 strikes of the first game of a match against Jackson at Airport Lanes for a 300 game. He added three more strikes to start the second game before a solid 9-pin ended his bid at a second perfect game. But his first game had the place jumping and everybody buzzing when it was over. \"The 10th frame, it was pretty scary but a great feeling,\" said Lewis, who led his team to a 26-4 victory over Jackson. \"The first one was pretty good, the second one was pretty good and the last one got a little inside, but it held in there and got the job done .\" Lewis is the seventh high school boys bowler to roll a 300 game this season, as reported to the Michigan High School Bowling Association website. Lewis also joins a list of recent Northwest bowlers to record 300 games in high school matches, joining Sierra Lasky in 2014, Corey Daniels in 2012 and <mark>Nick Taylor</mark> in 2011. Teammate Trevor Simons had a 300 game in November during the Greater Jackson USBC youth city tournament at Brooklyn Lanes, bowling with Lewis and fellow seniors Chris Salkowski and Tyler Ockert. Lewis remembered the moment Simons got his perfect game. \"It was awesome to watch,\" Lewis said. \"I felt kind of proud, it was cool. I was like,' I want to go get one of those .'\" Bowling with a Roto Grip Hyper Cell he also used to shoot his previous high game of 289 during a Youth Masters tournament, Lewis packed the pocket 12 straight times in the first game. He showed no nervousness, even as the crowd went silent in the late-going. \"The 10th frame was when they really got bad,\" he said of the nerves. \"When I was going up for the last one, I thought I was having a seizure. I wasn't sure, but that's what it felt like. Up until then, it wasn't too bad .\" In the crowd for his feat were his parents, Terry and Nancy Lewis, his girlfriend, and a large gathering of Northwest supporters. He said picking up his first perfect game with his team was the way he would have drawn it up. \"It's awesome getting to celebrate with the guys,\" Lewis said. \"It's nice having their support .\" Lewis finished the second game with a 213 for a 513 two-game series for Northwest (3-1). Simons, incidentally, had a solid day on the lanes himself, firing scores of 258 and 243 for a 501 series. Rob Dunham added games of 205 and 243 for the victors. Jackson (4-3) was led by Drake Csage with games of 257 and 235 for a 492 series, Joseph Bleiler with 213 and 223 (436) and Jacob Oberst with 236 and 188 (422)."}, {"articleID": "2017050719_00872854_W", "names": {"Ramon Diaz": ["Q348557", "Q6099558"]}, "date": "2017-05-07", "url": "http://www.gulf-times.com/story/547180/Rayyan-face-make-or-break-clash-with-Saudi-s-Al-Hi", "content": "Rayyan face make-or-break clash with Saudi's Al Hilal May 07 2017 10:13 PM Al Rayyan coach Michael Laudrup. Text Size: A By Sports Reporter/Doha Al Rayyan face a tightrope situation when they take on already qualified Saudi giants Al Hilal in their Last Group D clash in the Asian Champions League in Doha today. A win will help Michael Laudrup's team top the group, while a loss, combined with a victory for Iran's Persepolis over the UAE's Al Wahda, will see them miss out on a spot in the last 16 of the lucrative continental championship. A draw will be helpful only if Persepolis go down to Al Wahda. With seven points from five matches, Al Rayyan are in second spot behind Al Hilal who have nine. Third placed Persepolis have six from five and Al Wahda have four. It's a peculiar situation that means even bottom-placed Al Wahda have a slim hope of making the knockouts. \"We have to ensure we win against Al Hilal and qualify on our own rather than depend on the other result,\" Al Rayyan coach Laudrup said yesterday. \"We are quite confident that we can overcome the challenge from Al Hilal,\" the Dane added. Al Rayyan last week booked their semi-final slot in the Emir Cup, but are still smarting from the 5-1 thrashing they suffered at the hands of Al Wahda that revived the UAE side's chances of a last 16 spot. Al Rayyan also lost to Al Hilal earlier in the group stage when when they went down 2-1 in Riyadh, the winning goal coming from a penalty in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time. \"We were unlucky to concede a penalty then. Hope our luck changes this time,\" added Laudrup, who will be banking on their South American professionals to progress to the knockouts for the first time in history. Al Hilal, on the other hand, have better pedigree. The winners of several regional titles, they finished runners-up in the 2014 Asian Champions League but were champions in 1991 and 2000 when the tournament was called the Asian Club Championship. Unbeaten Al Hilal have posted two wins and three draws from their five games on the continent to book their place in the last 16 with a match to spare, but must gain at least a point against second-placed Al Rayyan to advance as table-toppers. They have several quality players in their line-up, including Yasser al-Shahrani, who is hoping that the memory of the 2014 defeat in the final to Western Sydney Wanderers can spur them on to greater heights this season. \"I can't describe exactly how I was feeling at the time,\" reflected defender Al Shahrani, who was just 22 when competing in his first and, to date, only AFC Champions League final. \"I was a very young player and even though I had the support of all the experienced players at Al Hilal, I felt the pressure because I wanted to compete well and put in a good performance .\" I think that the group did well to get to the final but I hope we can do that again this year because last time we didn't win it. \"The following year Al Hilal again performed admirably before ultimately being ousted in the semi-finals by the United Arab Emirates' Al Ahli, although last year's Round of 16 defeat to Lokomotiv failed to match expectations. <mark>Ramon Diaz</mark>'s side, though, are again likely to be among the strongest contenders from the West, having yet to taste defeat on their march to the knockout round and boasting a squad replete with Saudi internationals .\" Our players have good experience in the ACL as it's not the first time we have participated in it, \"added Al Shahrani, who has missed the previous two Group D games. Meanwhile, an exciting encounter is expected at Azadi Stadium in Tehran today as Persepolis host Al Wahda. Early pacesetters Persepolis have suffered a dip in form of late, picking up just two points from a possible nine, and must win to have any chance of progression. The Iranian champions welcome back captain Jalal Hosseini and Soroush Rafieitelgary from suspension for the crunch tie."}, {"articleID": "2019041122_00161251_W", "names": {"Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"]}, "date": "2019-04-11", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/games/11347/Rainbow", "content": "RAINBOW SIX: SIEGE REVIEW.

His business saw a savings of more than 13,000 kWh, which equates to an estimated savings of just over $1,200 per year--cutting the power bill nearly in half. <mark>Chen</mark>'s employees love the new lighting, too, since it makes for a more comfortable environment and allows them to work more safely. \"They thought I'd spent a lot of money to make everything so nice and bright,\" says <mark>Chen</mark>. \"They were so surprised to hear the new lights were actually saving us money, because the store has never looked better .\" He's so happy with Efficiency Nova Scotia that he's talking them up whenever he meets another small business owner. \"I went to a convenience store the other day and the owner and I got to talking about power bills,\" says <mark>Chen</mark>. \"He was paying what I used to pay, and his store is maybe 1,000 square feet and mine is 10,000 square feet.

The study, conducted by the Highway Loss Data Institute looked at three states: Colorado, Oregon and Washington. According to the study, the number of vehicle collisions reported to insurance companies in the three states is at least 3% higher than what would have been expected if marijuana had not been legalised. However, the study did not indicate whether the increase in collisions were directly caused by drivers who were under the influence of marijuana.

Don't miss: Holocaust survivor stops Orthodox Jews demanding women move seats on El Al flights The institute compared collision claims before and after legalisation, with collision claim rates of comparable states where marijuana is still illegal, to determine whether collision rates are higher than they would be if recreational use was still illegal.

SALT LAKE COMIC CON SAYS COURT-ORDERED PAYMENT OF $4 MILLION IN TRADEMARK WAR WILL\" DESTROY' THE EVENT: The producers of the Salt Lake City comic convention fear for the event's future, and Utah's economy, after they were given a court order to pay $4 million in a trademark infringement war with San Diego Comic-Con. The Salt Lake Tribune: \"Dan Farr Productions, the company behind the FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention, filed an emergency motion with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, asking for a temporary postponement on the payment pending appeal in court. If the $4 million judgment is enforced, the company will be\" destroyed,' the motion states, costing Utah's economy \"millions of dollars .' But the court\" likely wouldn't harm' the other party--San Diego Comic-Con, by granting a stay. The California-based convention sued the event formerly known as Salt Lake Comic Con in 2014 about the use of \"comic con' in the Utah company's name. San Diego Comic-Con's legal team argued that even without the hyphen, those words infringed on its own trademark and confused people into thinking the events were associated. A federal jury sided with San Diego Comic-Con at the end of last year but found there had been no willful infringement and awarded FanX a slight break on attorney fees. The jury awarded $20,000 in damages to San Diego Comic-Con, which had originally sought $12 million, and $3.9 million in attorney fees and costs rather than the $5 million its lawyers had initially asked for. Still, the Utah-based company said in its motion Wednesday that the\" nearly $4 million award is wildly excessive .' The producers of FanX are also protesting a judgment that FanX stop using the phrase \"formerly known as Salt Lake Comic Con' in advertising and social media and delete any posts before the court ruling that refer to their event as\" comic con .' \"https: //bit.ly/2OlTNAF * INDUSTRY NEWS * AccorHotels has completed its acquisition of a 50-percent stake in Sbe Entertainment Group.
