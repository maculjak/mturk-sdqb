post comments manila, philippines (ap) - a former philippine military chief who committed suicide after being linked to a corruption scandal was buried at a heroes' cemetery sunday as senators vowed to press on with an investigation into military graft. military pallbearers brought the flag-draped coffin of retired gen. <mark>angelo reyes</mark> to his tomb at the national heroes' cemetery as his widow and sons - all dressed in white - wept and dropped petals on his casket. the mourners were led by former president gloria macapagal arroyo, whom <mark>reyes</mark> served loyally through four failed military uprisings. <mark>reyes</mark>, who also served as defense chief and was among the country's most prominent generals, shot himself in the chest at his mother's grave tuesday after he and two other ex military chiefs of staff were accused of pocketing millions of dollars from funds intended for troop salaries, combat needs and a military hospital. <mark>reyes</mark> denied the accusation. \"we can proudly say that he died an honorable death, with dignity,\" <mark>reyes</mark>'s son, marc, told mourners after the burial. \"no one can take that away from us.\" in eulogies late saturday, fellow generals and former arroyo cabinet members expressed shock at his death, describing him as a patriotic general and doting father. <mark>reyes</mark> oversaw many counterinsurgency battles, including an offensive in 2000 that led to the fall of the main stronghold of the country's largest muslim rebel group. he was in charge of the departments of defense, environment, energy, interior and local government affairs and held other key posts under arroyo. corruption, long entrenched in philippine society, is an especially explosive issue in the inadequately equipped and poorly paid 120,000-strong military and has sparked several insurrections by disgruntled troops in the last two decades. leonor briones, a former philippine treasury head who has conducted extensive studies of corruption, said about 20 percent of the government budget is lost to graft. she said the problem could undermine president benigno aquino iii's administration if he fails to curb corruption as he promised in last year's campaign. \"you're sitting on a time bomb,\" briones said. \"the level of disaffection is mostly among the well-informed right now...but people may eventually realize that their poverty and hunger are directly caused by corruption.\" senate president juan ponce enrile said senators would press on with their investigation of military graft despite criticism that hostile questioning at a jan. 27 hearing may have prompted <mark>reyes</mark> to kill himself. \"it is unfortunate that somebody took his life because of any investigation done by us,\" enrile told dzbb radio. \"but if we're going to stop, it's the nation's interest that will be hurt.\" previous article death toll in iraq blast rises to 36"}, {"articleID":

first time since the pair teamed up in response to superstorm sandy. christie made an unannounced visit to the white house, where he met with obama to press for $83 billion in extra disaster aid for his state plus new york and connecticut. obama is expected to ask congress for about $50 billion in additional emergency aid for 11 states struck by the late october storm. christie made a similar pitch to a fellow republican, house speaker john boehner of ohio, later at the capitol. he also met with sen. mary landrieu, d-la., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, which oversees aid. new york gov. andrew cuomo and new york city mayor michael bloomberg have made similar trips to washington recently to press for federal money. christie wouldn't talk to reporters about his meeting with the president. the new jersey governor could seek the presidency himself in 2016. his warm praise of obama's handling of the storm just days before the election in november drew fire some fellow republicans. but the fast friendship christie and obama formed as they toured the devastation from sandy in the final days before the presidential election could pay dividends for a governor eager to rebuild his state and in need of federal dollars. christie dodged questions from the throng of reporters who trailed him through the corridors of the capitol. he ran into sen. <mark>scott brown</mark>, a massachusetts republican who lost in november, in a senate hallway. the pair embraced and christie promised to call <mark>brown</mark>. christie's white house visit even sparked speculation he might be carrying a private message from the president to boehner. obama and the speaker talked by telephone wednesday about averting the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in january. a boehner spokesman declined to say what the speaker and christie talked about.\" going home, guys, \"christie said after emerging from his boehner meeting, his final stop of the day on capitol hill.\" i'm not talking, guys. \"then he headed to a taping of comedy central's\" the daily show \"with <mark>jon stewart</mark> set to air thursday night. christie's pitch on federal aid was echoed by other officials at a senate panel hearing thursday. trains, tracks, tunnels, bridges, roads, rail stations and airports damaged from superstorm sandy will cost billions of dollars to repair, and even more to make them resilient enough to prevent similar devastation from future storms, lawmakers and transportation officials from new york and new jersey told the senate commerce, science and transportation committee's transportation subcommittee. transportation infrastructure in new york suffered $7.5 billion in damage, said sen. charles schumer, d-n.y. the new york metropolitan transportation authority, which operates the city's subway system, pegged its damages at $5 billion. james weinstein, executive director of nj transit, said $100 million is needed to repair or replace storm-damaged equipment, including rolling stock, for new jersey's transit system. he said it will take another $300 million to fix and replace track, wires, signaling, electrical substations and other equipment, and to cover the cost of supplemental bus and ferry service and lost revenue. amtrak got off relatively lightly, the train system's ceo, joseph boardman, told the senate commerce transportation subcommittee. including lost revenue, the storm's cost to amtrak is about $60 million, he said. improvements to tunnels and equipment made with money from obama's stimulus program mitigated some of the storm's damage, he said. christie pitches obama for more storm recovery aid new jersey republican gov. chris christie

Mexicans \"rapists\" during his campaign announcement last month. In many ways, this behavior should be expected of \"the <mark>Donald</mark>,\" who has been well-known for his overinflated ego and bombastic statements for years. However, what what less expected is that other, more serious Republican presidential contenders would defend him. From Mother Jones: During an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said, \"I salute <mark>Donald Trump</mark> for focusing on the need to address illegal immigration.\" ...Rick Santorum also came out on #teamtrump. The former senator told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday that he did not like <mark>Trump</mark>' s \"verbiage,\" but said that <mark>Trump</mark> \"focused on a very important issue for American workers, and particularly legal immigrants in this country.\" Referring to the storm that followed <mark>Trump</mark>' s remarks, Ben Carson contended that political correctness was overshadowing the debate about immigration reform. \"It' s the P.C. police out in force,\" Carson told the Daily Caller. \"They want to make very clear that this is a topic you' re not supposed to bring up.\" Naturally, these more seasoned politicians would make <mark>Trump</mark>'s statements more palpable by reverting to talking points about immigration, but that's not what he was talking about. He explicitly called Mexican immigrants rapists. It should come as no surprise that the so-called \"PC Police\" would be upset when painting an estimated 11.6 million people with such a broad and dark stroke with the only qualification that \"some, I assume, are good people.\" Sadly, <mark>Trump</mark>'s ignorant statements have not just been rewarded by his fellow presidential contenders but the voters as well. The <mark>Donald</mark> leading the latest Economist/YouGov poll at 15 percent, which seems to confirm a popular talking about the American right: conservatives lack empathy. Is this really how we talk about our fellow man in 2015? Calling strangers rapists for trying to make a better life for their family? Or what about calling a teenager a \"thug\" for attending a pool party? All policy aside, conservatives need to start acknowledging the humanity of their neighbors before rushing to judgement about their actions. As <mark>Jack Hunter</mark> put it at The Daily Beast last month, \"Putting people before an agenda or broad prejudices puts us all in a much better place.\" "}, {"articleID": "2014102810_00049366_W", "names": {"Tony Jones": ["Q1798305", "Q20710818", "Q22673586", "Q4160430", "Q53812649", "Q7822672", "Q7822675", "Q7822676", "Q7822677", "Q7822678", "Q7822679", "Q7822680"], "Chris Dean": ["Q16979886", "Q2964697"]}, "date": "2014-10-28", "url": "http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=266354&newlang=&topic=39&catid=67", "content": "2014 Martinsville II (Chase 7): NASCAR Sprint Cup - Sunday Notebook Dale Earnhardt Jr Wins At Martinsville As Calamity Strikes Chase Favorites 2014 Martinsville II (Chase 7): NASCAR Sprint Cup Race Results - Earnhardt Jr, Chevrolet Win! 2014 Malaysian GP (Sepang): MotoGP Race Results - Marquez Wins! Equals Doohan's Record Posted by: newsla on Oct 28, 2014 - 06:12 AM 2014 IHRA Hot Rod Champion <mark>Tony Jones</mark> Only this time, there was much, much more at stake. <mark>Jones</mark> secured his second ever victory in IHRA competition at the IHRA Summit Racing Equipment World Finals at Memphis International Raceway earlier this month, clinching the Hot Rod World Championship in the process when he bested Fowler for the second time in as many tries during the Summit Racing Equipment Tournament of Champions presented by AMSOIL. With a championship on the line, <mark>Jones</mark>, a newcomer to IHRA competition, bested Fowler with a .024 reaction time paired with a 10.911-second pass in the 10.90 index class at 140.39 mph while Fowler, who had been spot-on all afternoon, ran a tick too quick with a 10.898 at 142.81 mph. The win gave <mark>Jones</mark> a championship in his first season out with the IHRA after finishing third in Division 4, capping off what can only be described as a dream season for <mark>Jones</mark>. \"I have pinched myself a couple of times, but it still really hasn't sunk in just yet that I won it,\" <mark>Jones</mark> said. \"All afternoon I just took it a round at a time. After every round we kept thinking it is just three more rounds, just two more rounds and then just one more round. In the winner's circle, my buddy looked at me and simply said\" zero more rounds' and it sort of clicked that we had just won it. \"After a long afternoon that included wins over the best-of-the-best in IHRA's Hot Rod category, the irony did not escape <mark>Jones</mark> as he went up against Fowler for the second time this season in Memphis.\" I really didn't think I could beat him twice. The first time we went to Memphis and beat him, he treed me. This time he stuck me in the left lane and I ended up treeing him. It was a great race, there were a lot of nerves, but the good Lord took the anxiety away from me and we were able to get the win, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. <mark>Jones</mark>' afternoon included wins over two divisional champions and a divisional runner-up after he himself barely managed to hold on to a spot in the field. <mark>Jones</mark> entered the final race of the divisional season as the points leader in Division 4, but two poor showings plummeted him to third in the standings - the cutoff point to make the tournament. But in Memphis, <mark>Jones</mark> proved he belonged. Driving his bright yellow '67 Camaro, <mark>Jones</mark> bested Joe Tillman, Dakota Lowery and Ricky Roe to secure his place in the finals. All three rounds proved a challenge, with <mark>Jones</mark> using a .003 light to overcome Tillman's 10.915 in round one and a near-dead on 10.902 with a .009 light was needed in the semifinals to best Roe's 10.907 with a .009 tree, moving <mark>Jones</mark> into the championship bout. Championship runner-up Fowler had wins over <mark>Chris Dean</mark>, Tim Andersen and 2014 IHRA Sportsman Driver of the Year John Dustin, capping a great year for the Point Pleasant, West Virginia native who had one win and championship in Division 3 behind the wheel of the Friends of Coal sponsored 1980 Camaro.\" This whole thing has been like a dream come true. You pray for something like this, but people like me, we are just out here enjoying the sport. People like us just don't win these things, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. Ironically, <mark>Jones</mark>' championship season almost didn't happen. It took the urging of longtime friend Roger Massey, himself an accomplished Top Sportsman racer, to get <mark>Jones</mark> out to his first IHRA event. From there, things just clicked for the Gilmer, Texas native.\" A friend of mine convinced me to give IHRA a try this year and from the very start, every time I went to a race, I found myself going rounds, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said.\" It was so different, so relaxing to run IHRA. I found myself right at home and before long we found ourselves leading the division. We almost gave it away in our final race, but we were able to hang on and get to Memphis. \"With the win, <mark>Jones</mark> will earn the coveted No. 1 for his car as he plans to continue racing with the IHRA and defend his championship in 2015. 2014 NHRA: Circle K Renews Sponsorship Of Tradition-Rich NHRA Winternationals To Open 2015 NHRA Mello Yello Series Season 2014 NHRA: It's Deja Vu All Over Again For Past Pro Mod Champion Coughlin 2014 NHRA: Brittany Force To Race Special Rookie Of The Year Dragster Starting In Vegas 2014 NHRA: Shoe's Latest News And Notes From Don Schumacher Racing 2014 NHRA: Courtney Force, Erica Enders-Stevens Eye History, World Championships Heading To NHRA Toyota Nationals In Las Vegas 2014 NHRA: NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series: Erica Enders-Stevens, Courtney Force And John Force 2014 NHRA: NHRA Mello Yello Countdown To The Championship Returns To Southern California Where Series Crowns Will Be Decided 2014 NHRA: Aeromotive Inc Named Sponsor Of Season-Ending NHRA Pro Mod Drag Racing Series Las Vegas Event 2014 NHRA: John Force Accepts Crew Chief Jimmy Prock's Resignation Today 2014 NHRA: T.J.

The revision to the existing prescribing rules are intended to minimize opportunities for misuse, abuse, diversion, addiction and overdoses, by flipping the presumption that a patient needs opioids to manage pain, and by addressing appropriate quantities for initial prescriptions. \"These rules are a critical part of our efforts to create conditions where we can prevent opioid addiction from starting,\" said Health Commissioner <mark>Mark Levine</mark>, MD.. To bridge the varying prescribing practices and philosophies among Vermont's prescribers, the rules set new \"defaults' for prescribing for pain, and requires that doctors assess non-opioid and non-pharmacological treatments before opioids are prescribed. Providers will also continue to engage patients in their own treatment decisions, through education concerning the risks associated with taking opioids, safe storage and appropriate disposal of opioids. Dr. <mark>Levine</mark> said the new rules were approved by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules following an extensive process that included 19 meetings and a public hearing with patients, physicians, pharmacists, dentists, and other stakeholders.

Bernie Sanders took heat from some Democrats for holding a town hall on Fox News Channel but there's one result hard to argue with: it was the most-watched candidate event in the election campaign so far. An estimated 2.55 million people saw Sanders' town hall Monday in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the Nielsen company said. Not only did that beat the 1.35 million people who saw Sanders on CNN on Feb. 25, the Fox telecast aired before prime time when traditionally the largest audience gathers. Sen. Kamala Harris' CNN town hall in January was seen by 1.95 million viewers, the previous high for a 2020 presidential contender. The Vermont senator also apparently had one prominent viewer in Washington. President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday that it was \"so weird to watch Crazy Bernie\" on Fox News. He said Bret Baier, who co-anchored the event with Martha MacCallum, and the audience was \"so smiley and nice.\" Baier later tweeted his thanks to Trump for watching, and said he'd like to have the president on a town hall or for an interview on his nightly news show. \"We cover all sides,\" Baier said. While Trump is a frequent interview subject on Fox, he tends to avoid newsier personalities like Baier and <mark>Chris Wallace</mark>. During the town hall, Sanders noted the blowback he'd gotten from some Democrats for appearing on Fox and took a few shots at the network, at one point drawing a rebuke from Baier. \"We are very grateful that you're here,\" Baier said. \"We are giving you an hour of substance and talk on our airwaves so we can get over the Fox thing, if you're alright with that,\" he said. Fox says it is in talks with other Democrats to have town halls on the network, but hasn't said who. Democratic National Committee head Tom Perez said earlier Monday that the organization was not reconsidering its decision in February not to hold any of its upcoming debates on the network. He was responding to a question from Fox's Bill Hemmer about upcoming debates, which the DNC has scheduled on NBC News and another on CNN. Fox chose not to preempt its opinionated prime-time lineup of Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham to show Sanders on Monday. The prime-time hosts spent relatively little time on the Sanders appearance that had preceded their shows. \"You saw crazy Bernie on the air tonight,\" Hannity said during his monologue. \"That was hard to watch...Let's hear every communist idea we possibly can.\" Ingraham had Trump aide Larry Kudlow on her show, and asked him to respond to a passage in the town hall where Sanders said that the economy was improving well before Trump took office.
