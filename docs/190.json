i talked to all four banks, as well as analysts, and lawyers. let's start with the banks. none has yet made any provisions against the potential cost of libor-related lawsuits. this is the response i got from lloyds: \"we have not taken any provision as it's just not possible at the moment to predict the scope and outcome of the various regulatory investigations or private lawsuits that are out there. that's both in terms of timing or scale .\" rbs, barclays, and hsbc are taking a broadly similar stance. lloyds and hsbc may not be in it quite as deeply as rbs and barclays. how about the legal angle? rich eldridge, a finance partner at manches, was kind enough to help. here's what he had to say: \"to be successful borrowers will have to show the basis on which they were led to believe libor would be calculated was false and this was material. no one knows how likely the claims are to succeed, but judges will know successful claims could potentially bankrupt state-owned banks and hit pension funds .\" so when it comes to provisions: \"i doubt anyone knows the cost to the banks if the courts decide to award compensation for libor fixing. firstly, banks will need to repay customers who were overcharged. secondly, judges may cancel interest rate swap contracts based on libor and banks may be forced to compensate hedge funds who bought a bank's side of swap transactions. investors in bank shares will no doubt be wary with no published figure of the potential exposure. a concern for a lot of people is bank shares can form a sizeable proportion of investments by pension funds .\" in other words: this potential car crash could actually close off half the motorway. how does the market feel about this? <mark>ian gordon</mark> is one of the more independent minded and thoughtful analysts. he says almost no one has this issue \"front of mind\". \"two reasons for that. one, the market has increasingly convinced itself that the burden of proof is very high. so other than the potential for a\" grand settlement \"the potential for an individual bank suffering a multi-billion hit feels much lower now than it did perhaps in early july .\" and, two, my guess is that any such settlement won't hit until 2016/17 which removes any spectre of an unmanageable hit to capital. just a potential hit to a (hopefully) more healthy income statement. \"so not the end of the world. who's likely to get hit? the received wisdom is barclays and rbs, as a result of the attempts at manipulation by their traders (worth pointing out that it's yet to be proved how successful they were). but mr <mark>gordon</mark> has an interesting theory:\" i can't help thinking that it was allegedly the [libor] submissions of lloyds [through hbos] and rbs which were persistently low-balled over an extended period and by a material amount. \"so his theory is the potential\" tail risks may be longest for lloyds and rbs? just a theory \". of course, the role of the bank of england in the\" low ball \"submissions of lloyds and rbs is somewhat murky. the central bank was desperately worried about the impact of a collapse in confidence in these two banks. but even if it was proved to have subtly endorsed the tactic you can't sue a central bank. if you want to grade the worries, rbs probably comes top followed by barclays and lloyds. hsbc shareholders may be able to breathe easier. its sins were largely committed elsewhere. as for valuations, they are still discounting difficulties for the banks. even though barclays shares have doubled since the summer it trades on only 0.6 times the book value of its businesses and a shade over 8.6 times earnings. as for lloyds, it is on 0.8 times book, 12.7 times earnings, while rbs is on a remarkably similar valuation (0.8 times, 13.3 times). hsbc, by contrast, sits on 1.3 times book, and 11.5 times this year's earnings. bound, beaten and robbed: backpackers attacked by whip-brandishing peruvian villagers in\" savage' two day ordeal missing irish tycoon found barefoot and starving with insult carved on forehead text messages between chris huhne and son reveal family split behind the speeding points scandal <mark>richard</mark> iii - the final act: archaeologists release image of skull that might be that of a king the bedroom tax is just the latest assault on our poorest citizens \"offensive (and not funny)' after years of insults, bbc finally censures jeremy clarkson stuck for a romantic idea?

with guns and camping gear inside - was abandoned on a fire road in the big bear lake. his footprints led away from the truck and vanished on frozen soil. with no sign of him and few leads, police offered a $1 million reward to bring him to justice and end a \"reign of terror\" that had more than 50 families of targeted los angeles police officers under round-the-clock protection after he threatened to bring \"warfare\" to the lapd, officers and their kin. just a few hours after police announced tuesday that they had fielded more than 1,000 tips with no sign of dorner, word came that a man matching his description had tied up two people in a big bear lake cabin, stole their car and fled. authorities didn't immediately give more details on the two people. game wardens from the california department of fish and wildlife who were part of the search detail spotted the purple nissan that had been reported stolen going in the opposite direction and gave chase, department spokesman lt. patrick foy said. the driver looked like dorner. they lost the purple car after it passed a school bus and turned onto a side road, but two other fish and wildlife patrols turned up that road a short time later, and were searching for the car when a white pickup truck sped erratically toward the wardens. \"he took a close look at the driver and realized it was the suspect,\" foy said. dorner, who allegedly stole the pickup truck at gunpoint after crashing the first car, rolled down a window and opened fire on the wardens, striking a warden's truck more than a dozen times. one of the wardens shot at the suspect as he rounded a curve in the road. it's unclear if he hit him, but the stolen pickup careened off the road and crashed in a snow bank. dorner then ran on foot to the cabin where he barricaded himself and got in a shootout with san bernardino county sheriff's deputies and other officers who arrived. swat team surrounded the cabin and used an armored vehicle to break out the cabin windows, said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. the officers then pumped a gas into the cabin and blasted a message over a loudspeaker: \"surrender or come out .\" the armored vehicle then tore down each of the cabin's four walls. a single shot was heard inside before the cabin was engulfed in flames, the law enforcement official told the associated press. until tuesday, authorities weren't sure dorner was still in big bear lake, where his pickup truck was found within walking distance from the cabin where he hid. even door-to-door searches failed to turn up any trace of him in the quiet, bucolic neighborhood where children were playing in the snow tuesday night. with many searchers leaving town amid speculation he was long gone, the command center across the street was taken down monday. <mark>ron erickson</mark>, whose house is only about quarter mile away, said officers interrogated him to make sure he wasn't being held hostage. <mark>erickson</mark> himself had been keeping a nervous watch on his neighborhood, but he never saw the hulking dorner. \"i looked at all the cabins that backed the national forest and i just didn't think to look at the one across from the command post,\" he said. \"it didn't cross my mind. it just didn't .\" police say dorner began his run on feb. 6 after they connected the slayings of a former police captain's daughter and her fiance with his angry manifesto. dorner blamed lapd capt. randal quan for providing poor representation before the police disciplinary board that fired him for filing a false report. dorner, who is black, claimed in his online rant that he was the subject of racism by the department and was targeted for doing the right thing. chief charlie beck, who initially dismissed dorner's allegations, said he would reopen the investigation into his firing - not to appease the ex-officer, but to restore confidence in the black community, which had a long fractured relationship with police that has improved in recent years. dorner vowed to get even with those who had wronged him as part of his plan to reclaim his good name. \"you're going to see what a whistleblower can do when you take everything from him especially his name!!!\" the rant said. \"you have awoken a sleeping giant .\" within hours of being named as a suspect in the killings, the 6-foot, 270-pounder described as armed and \"extremely dangerous,\" tried unsuccessfully to steal a boat in san diego to flee to mexico. after leaving a trail of evidence, he headed north where he opened fire on two patrol cars in riverside county, shooting three officers and killing one. with a description of his car broadcast all over the southwest and mexico, he managed to get to the mountains 80 miles east of los angeles where his burning truck was found with a broken axle. only a short distance from the truck, he spent his final days with a front-row seat to the search mobilized right outside. fubar. you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0. you can skip to the end and leave a response. pinging is currently not allowed.", "articleID": "2013021312_00096687_W", "names": {"Ron Erickson": ["Q16106250", "Q7363743"]}}]
