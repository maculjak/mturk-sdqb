angeles (ap) - police arrested two young men in the shootings deaths of two graduate students from china last month near the university of southern california, an attack that stunned a school that has more international students than any other u.s. university. javier bolden, 19, and bryan barnes, 20, were arrested friday on suspicion of killing the two during an apparent robbery attempt, los angeles police chief charlie beck said. ming qu, of jilin, and <mark>ying wu</mark>, of hunan, were shot april 11 while sitting in a bmw about a mile away from the usc campus. both were 23 years old. their parents filed a lawsuit this week accusing usc of misrepresenting safety at the campus, where nearly one-fifth of the 38,000 students are from overseas, including 2,500 from china. the motive for their killings was still under investigation, beck said, but the \"evidence points to a street robbery,\" and investigators believe the killings were part of a larger string of crimes the two men committed in los angeles. \"forensic evidence recovered at the scene linked them to two other attempted homicides,\" beck said at a news conference. evidence directly linked both suspects to the victims, he added. beck said neither suspect had a long criminal history or is a documented gang member, though police suspect they may have a gang affiliation. mayor antonio villaraigosa congratulated the city's police force, which cooperated with the fbi and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives to investigate the killings and make the arrests friday. he praised officers for \"diligence in following every lead and investigating every detail .\" beck declined to provide details of how the suspects were pinpointed but said, \"this was a crime that shocked this city, and we absolutely left no stone unturned .\" barnes was arrested at a home about five miles from campus friday afternoon, and bolden was arrested a few hours later in palmdale, beck said. both were being held without bail and are set to be arraigned tuesday. the campus is located in an urban center a few miles south of downtown. it is across the street from county museums and not far from the staples center arena and a gentrifying area of victorian homes. yet it is also known as an area that had faced high crime and gang activity. in their lawsuit, the victims' parents alleged that the school made false claims about safety in the \"frequently asked questions\" section of its online application. the 15-page lawsuit accuses usc of hiding behind the word \"urban\" and not saying the school is in a high-crime residential area. it also notes that chinese students in particular would interpret urban to mean usc is in a safe area. \"the\" urban' representation misled chinese students, including ming qu, into believing the area is safe since in china, the more urban the area, the safer the area, \"the lawsuit states, claiming usc understood this is how chinese students would interpret the description. usc lawyer debra wong yang said the university was deeply saddened by the deaths but found the lawsuit to be baseless. <mark>zhou rong</mark>, a beijing-based education consultant who advises chinese students wishing to study overseas, said the word\" urban \"to people in china has no connotation of safety .\" i think it only means the location and has nothing to do with safety and crime, \"said <mark>zhou</mark>, who works for new oriental vision overseas consulting. the school and city police announced new security measures after the slayings and promised more video cameras, escorts and patrols. the additional security will include sending over 30 more officers to the department division that handles the usc area, and the university will pay for four additional officers to patrol the student residential neighborhoods, beck said. in a statement friday, usc president c.l. max nikias praised law enforcement and city officials .\" the arrest of the suspects in the tragic deaths of our graduate students, <mark>ying wu</mark> and ming qu, begins the process of healing and of closing a painful chapter in the life of our community, \"nikias said. _______ associated press researcher henry hou in beijing contributed to this report abc12 main station 810-233-3130", "articleID": "2012051909_00080791_W", "names": {"Zhou Rong": ["Q45428989",

scientist a prominent ugandan physician and health researcher says a recently formed consortium has launched a transformational framework for training doctors. <mark>nelson sewankambo</mark>, professor of medicine and principal at makerere university college of health sciences, said the group is emphasizing the sustainable health workforce development in uganda. professor of medicine <mark>nelson sewankambo</mark> at makerere university college of health sciences download \"the government's reaction has been superb, which is unprecedented. the government has expressed a lot of interest in collaborating to bring training institutions into a much closer working relationship with both the ministry of education and the ministry of health,\" said <mark>sewankambo</mark>. \"we are having fairly regular meetings between our institutions as a group? and what has also happened is that they had formed an inter-ministerial committee that brings together people from the two ministries again to discuss and plan for issues around health professional education .\" <mark>sewankambo</mark> outlined the goals of the consortium's initiative. \"it's creating an opportunity for the universities themselves and also government departments to think and pay great attention to [the] training of health workers? it is opening up more interest and more discussions about health workers in general,\" said <mark>sewankambo</mark>. \"the [expectation] is that government is going to pay great attention to building capacity in the country, how to retain these health workers in the country. [we expect] government is going to put more resources [or] funding into training of health workers .\" <mark>sewankambo</mark> said the administration seems to recognize the financial needs and the challenges of universities training health care workers. analysts have often expressed concern about retaining them. they cite instances where doctors, nurses and other health professionals emigrate due to poor pay back home. <mark>sewankambo</mark> said policy makers should make judicious use of the country's health care resources. \"it is true that we can increase the efficiency and the way we use available resources right now. through our discussions with the government departments we are going to identify where the hemorrhage is, the wastage of resources [and] where we can improve to utilize the existing resources. indeed there is a movement in that direction,\" he said. <mark>sewankambo</mark> said the consortium's initiative involves working closely with other health professional workers across africa. \"there used to be a very active association of medical schools in africa? we have argued for a revitalization of that association with the intent that it will provide opportunity for collaboration across africa? and indeed that association is being revamped .\" professor <mark>sewankambo</mark>'s comments followed his presentation called developing a

council discussed offering a citizen's academy program to the community and having their own planning and zoning commission for the city, as well as voting on an employment package for city manager larry riner, at their recent workshop. councilwoman <mark>julie smith</mark> explained that the citizen's academy program is an outstanding program to move forward in tifton. \"it's a great way to get citizens involved and to develop leadership,\" she said. \"i really would like to move forward with this sooner than later. i think this would be great for our citizens .\" <mark>smith</mark> stated that citizens would be educated about city government and how they interact with the county and various organizations. \"it helps build educated citizens,\" she said. she stated that city department heads and the chamber would serve as the instructors. she mentioned that douglas has this program and is doing well with it. <mark>smith</mark> said the program will run for approximately eight weeks and then citizens would graduate. she would like to start the citizen's academy program in september in order to go ahead and graduate the first class of citizens. she noted that they would need sponsors for the program to provide light meals, etc. and also to fund the program. tifton mayor jamie cater told <mark>smith</mark> to contact douglas to gather information about the funding of the program. councilman chris parrott stated that he liked the idea of a citizen's academy and feels that they should offer it to the community; riner agreed. cater commented that the program should be dedicated to the late charles \"charlie\" henry howell, who served as city manager from 1996 to 2005. he told the gazette that it was howell's idea to start a program like this in tifton back when he was city manager. he said it was already in the plan but was never executed. cater said riner and <mark>smith</mark> had mentioned the program to the council, but they never got around to it. he said it means a lot to dedicate the program to howell. in other business, city attorney rob wilmot informed the council that over the past two months, he has worked with bert crowe, director of environmental management, on the land development code for the city, and they felt that the city should have their own planning and zoning amendment. wilmot stated that the amendment is designed to establish a planning and zoning for the city. he noted that the proposal calls for five members to serve on the board. he said aside from the city having its own planning and zoning commission, there are no changes. councilwoman marianna keesee asked if the proposal addresses a quorum as to how business will be conducted with a certain number of members. wilmot said that it should; he hadn't noticed it in the proposal but would look over it again. he also noted that the filling of positions for the board will be made by the council. also, after returning from executive session, the council voted on an employment package for riner's position as city manager. cater said all council members agreed with the package, which includes an annual salary of $137,500; $600 in car allowance; annual dues and conference expenses for state organizations; benefits; annual performance appraisal; and 12 months' severance pay if terminated without cause or return to position as director of operations. this agreement is renewed every year. cater noted that while serving as city manager, riner will also be filling four vacant positions - director of operations, street superintendent, public works director and director of water and sewage. \"he plans to continue those jobs,\" he stated. cater said the city does not have a contract with riner; he serves at the pleasure of the council from meeting to meeting on a day-to-day basis. other items discussed at the workshop:? city clerk rona martin discussed the board report. there still remain some vacancies. also, juanita taylor withdrew her application from the greater tift county planning and zoning commission, leaving that spot vacant. <mark>smith</mark> mentioned that <mark>keri jones</mark> has withdrew her application as well and pointed out that jan wise, who is interested in serving on the planning and zoning board, was willing to come to the workshop and would answer any questions. martin noted that there is a vacancy on the tifton tree board. parrott stated, \"we need more people to serve .\" ? riner addressed the downtown development authority board's recommendation to the council to decide if they want to accept ownership of the tift theatre. due to a question involving a conflict of interest, the council decided to discuss the matter later after wilmot researches the issue and looks into it more .? ricky hobby gave a report on the bid for a knuckle boom truck and loader for the sanitation department in the daily collection of residential yard debris. he informed the council that this unit is a replacement for unit #803, which is in need of extensive repairs, and that due to the age of the vehicle and loader, it is not feasible to make these repairs. hobby stated that the current unit is nine years old. he said the new unit will be purchased using funds from the solid waste capital replacement account. he stated that the lowest proposal offered that met specs was from consolidated disposal systems from smyrna. the amount was $116,686 .? also discussed were resolutions providing for the extension of senior garbage rates, alcoholic beverage license for citgo food mart on west seventh street and alcoholic beverage license for sam's grocery & grill on highway 41 north. to contact reporter latasha everson, call 382-4321.", "articleID": "2012052903_00047083_W",

tuesday 29 may 2012 09:30 county upper school's basketball teams enjoyed a memorable season with no less than five of their sides reaching the last 16 of the national schools basketball tournament. the under-17 boys' team were the stand out performers of the school, reaching the national championship final, only missing out on claiming the title after a hard-fought 85-63 defeat to london representatives st aloysius. four other teams also enjoyed relative success, including the under-14 and under-16 girls' teams, who despite still developing, became suffolk champions back in february. this enabled them to go through to the last 16 of the national competition before both were knocked out by greenwards academy under-14s 84-29 and shenfields under-16s 60-39, respectively. despite the defeats, coach <mark>darren johnson</mark> was left delighted. \"our girls team were outstanding this year and thoroughly deserved to finish where they did,\" he said. \"i am really proud of how we came together, played great team basketball and i am looking forward to helping this group of girls develop as basketball players .\" the under-18 boys' team won their domestic pool stages after defeating both seevic from essex and notre dame high school from norfolk before going on to become east of england champions with a dominating performance against shenfield high school form brentwood, winning the game 94-36. however they could not recreate that form in the national tournament as they knocked out by northampton school with a 73-59 loss. like the under-18s, the under-19s eased through their pool group, only missing out on finishing leaders, due to having their match with milton keynes void. as one of the last 16 teams left in the national tournament, county faced a tough encounter against barking abbey basketball academy, one of the strongest basketball academies in the country. and despite a spirited performance from county they were eliminated following a 83-58 defeat. <mark>johnson</mark> went on to hail county's overall success and stated he is no doubt about the bright future of basketball in the region. appeal for witnesses after late night crash

he sometimes reports on, lansing meteorologist jake dunne uses his concise and easygoing storytelling ability to grab the reader in \"stand by,\" his new mystery-thriller. dunne's follow-up to his 2008 \"johnstone junction\" picks up on denver weatherman <mark>sam stone</mark>, a year and a half after the amateur detective was called on to solve a mystery. this time, <mark>stone</mark> is

as in the first book, weather plays a major role in the plot, and dunne said his writing career is a natural outgrowth of his day job. \"i tell many stories every day,\" he said. \"some are a minute. some are three minutes .\" he said he likens his writing to john grisham and calls his style \"simple yet sarcastic .\" since the weather in michigan is so notoriously unpredictable, many readers will understand how dunne has slipped so easily into writing fiction. the wlns-tv morning meteorologist has now logged nearly seven years in lansing after moving to michigan from casper, wyo. dunne is a geosciences graduate of the other msu - mississippi state university. he said growing up in wichita, kan., with its crazy weather patterns attracted him to reporting on the weather. much of his new
