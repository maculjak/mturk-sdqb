The URL has been copied to your clipboard No media source currently available 0:00 0:06:12 64 kbps | MP3 Pop-out player Burning coal for energy adds planet-warming carbon dioxide, or CO2, to Earth's atmosphere. As the planet heats up, experts warn that simply cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to avoid possibly disastrous levels of global warming. CO2 must also be removed from the atmosphere, they say. Existing experimental machines that pull CO2 directly from the air are too costly to be widely used. But a new report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says effective carbon-removal technology already exists. It is not costly, or even complex science. It is forests. The report explains that planting trees and overseeing forests are cost-effective ways to clean the air. They also work well across large areas. Forests used to cover large areas of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. In the state of West Virginia, a kind of mining known as strip mining left the land there bare, without trees. Now experts are working to bring back the forests that once covered much of the state. West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest is home to a rare group of trees. They are called virgin woods; they have never been touched by humans. <mark>Shane Jones</mark> is a biologist with the U.S. Forest Service. \"Living in the East, there's not many places you can go and be untouched by Man .\" <mark>Jones</mark> says the trees there were missed by mistake when the surrounding forest was cut down for wood many years ago. That mistake turned out to be a good thing; red spruce forests such as those in the Monongahela are great at taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and locking it into the soil. <mark>Jones</mark> explains as he runs his hand through the dark black earth beside a tree. \"See all that organic material? It's black because it's incredibly high in carbon .\" Over the years, coal mining and cutting forests took over 90 percent of the red spruce forests from the Appalachian Mountains. Now, as the planet warms, the need for forests to remove coal's CO2 is increasingly urgent. <mark>Chris Barton</mark> works for the University of Kentucky. As he walks along the Appalachian land, he says the needs of warm-weather rainforests get most of the world's attention. \"But here in the temperate region of the world, in Appalachia, four hours away from Washington, D.C., we have billions of trees that potentially we could be planting .\" So, <mark>Barton</mark> started a group called Green Forests Work. Its members aim to put trees back on the roughly 400,000 hectares of land that was cleared away by strip mining. However, <mark>Barton</mark> explains, the land has problems. \"If you went out and planted trees on these sites, they just didn't grow. The ground was way too compacted. Water didn't infiltrate. Roots can't penetrate. Oxygen can't circulate in those environments .\" The solution? Using heavy equipment, workers tear up the ground. The process lets the trees they plant put down roots. <mark>Barton</mark> says not everyone believes the solution is a good idea. \"We've had a lot of people kinda look at us twice. But the really interesting thing about it is, after we do it, there's no question that that was the right thing to do .\" And it has worked. Forests are coming back to the grounds. Scientists say that, in West Virginia alone, restoring red spruce forests to the area could send what is equal to 56 million barrels of oil into the ground. But it will take time. A long time. Around the world, experts say, nature offers powerful tools to fight climate change. But patience is needed, <mark>Jones</mark> says. \"It's really awesome to see a tree planted eight years ago that's now waist high. But at the end of the day, at the end of my day, we're barely getting started. Because our main goal with the restoration work that we do here is to basically take actions to then let nature take over .\" Nature works, but slowly, in its own time. I'm Anne Ball.

The Committee on Climate Change will also advise on whether the UK needs to review its 2050 target of cutting emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990 levels, to meet international commitments set out in the Paris Agreement. Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"On the global stage, the UK is driving forward action on climate change through our work at the UN and with our Commonwealth partners .\" To ensure that we continue to lead from the front, we are asking the experts to advise on targets for net zero emissions. \"Are we on the #RoadtoZero road transport emissions?

Limiting warming to 1.5 C is possible but will require fast and far-reaching changes to power generation, industry, transport, buildings and potential shifts in lifestyle such as eating less meat. It will also require action to take excess carbon emissions out of the atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. The letter to CCC chairman Lord Deben invites his committee to consider what emissions reductions would be needed to make an appropriate contribution to the Paris target of a\" well below 2C \"rise or the 1.5 C limit urged in the new report. Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said the CCC would give\" advice on a roadmap to a net zero economy, including how emissions might be reduced and the expected costs and benefits of doing so \". The move comes at the start of the Green GB Week initiative, and the Government claimed that jobs in green industries could reach two million by 2030, generating up to \u00a3 170 billion in exports. Ministers will also set out proposals for new laws for\" smart energy \"appliances like washing machines and electric heating, with the ambition of making all new buildings smart by 2030. Environmental campaigners welcomed the Government's net-zero move, but called for a commitment to the 1.5 C goal. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate at WWF said:\" Scientists from around the world said we had 12 years to tackle climate change. \"Governments can no longer shirk their responsibilities .\" It's time to act and, crucially, embrace the opportunities a green economy presents. \"Done right, this could be the biggest economic opportunity in history, driving innovation, job creation and better living standards .\" By limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 \u00b0 C, we could reduce air pollution and save the lives of 153M children, neighbours, and people around the world.

After polling at only a few single digits last year, he is now emerging as a top-tier candidate, pushing past former Vice President Joe Biden to claim a spot far closer to the top of the polls. One could attribute this rise to the insane amount of cash he has spent on his campaign--more than $200 million so far--out of his own bottomless pockets to blast commercials on every platform as he sells himself to the public. Now, liberal pundits are contemplating things like, \"It is time to earnestly consider the possibility that Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee for president .\" But are we honestly considering him a serious candidate? Bloomberg's main stint with politics was as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, during which time he pushed aggressively to criminalize and racially profile people of color under the guise of the \"stop and frisk\" policing model. The idea was simple: Preemptively arrest poor Black and Latino men, and crime rates would magically drop. Thousands of men were ruined in Bloomberg's dragnet, and the policy persisted until legal challenges forced the city to end the program with a judge declaring it unconstitutional. In launching his bid for the White House last year, Bloomberg stood in front of black congregants at a church and said, \"I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong .\" Perhaps the billionaire candidate simply expected that his money would wash the stench of racism away. But then, this week, the audio of a speech he gave just five years ago at the Aspen Institute defending \"stop-and-frisk\" became public. The recording, posted by independent journalist Benjamin Dixon, reveals Bloomberg saying: Ninety-five percent of your murders--murderers and murder victims--fit one M.O.. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is ....You want to spend the money, put a lot of cops in the streets. Put the cops where the crime is, which means minority neighborhoods. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them. Bloomberg likely knew soon after he said this that his comments were unconscionable--he asked the Aspen Institute not to distribute the video footage of his speech. The words are on par with the type of racism President <mark>Donald Trump</mark> has spewed and shows a shocking disdain for the Constitution on par with that of a radical right-wing extremist (after all, Bloomberg won his self-funded race for mayor of New York City as a Republican). As part of the damage control over the devastating audio clip, Bloomberg said in a statement, \"I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95%, but I should've done it faster and sooner .\" But Bloomberg left his mayoral office in 2013. Two years later, he was still defending his racist policy in public. The Intercept's Lee Fang delved into the actual numbers and found that, far from cutting back the program by 95%, Bloomberg actually increased arrests by seven times during his tenure. Bloomberg has been caught in a lie. Aren't we done electing liars? Perhaps Bloomberg hopes white liberals can set aside any misgivings about his racism simply because they are fantasizing about the unlimited access to his campaign cash to defeat <mark>Trump</mark>. Bloomberg is currently the ninth richest person on the entire planet. In a sincere sounding op-ed in the New York Times, he explained how \"the rewards of the economy are far too concentrated at the top,\" and that he is \"making the system fairer and more progressive, including by increasing taxes on wealthy people like me .\" But only three years ago, Bloomberg--in a conversation with the then-head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine La Garde--explained that he was in favor of regressive taxation because it helped socially engineer poor people's habits: Taxes are regressive, yes they are. That's the good thing about them because the problem is in people that don't have a lot of money and so higher taxes should have a bigger impact on their behavior and how they deal with themselves. So I listen to people saying, \"Oh we don't want to tax the poor .' Well, we want the poor to live longer so that they can get an education and enjoy life. And that's why you do want to do exactly what a lot of people say you don't want to do.... If you raise taxes on full sugary drinks, for example, they will drink less and there's no question that full sugared drinks are one of the major factors in obesity and obesity is one of the major factors to heart disease. While this clip has not received as much attention as Bloomberg's defense of\" stop-and-frisk, \"it is just as instructive about his attitude toward low-income people. A multibillionaire's opinion of those on the bottom rung of society is--unsurprisingly--utterly distorted by his obscene wealth. How exactly can a racist, classist billionaire be favored by Democrats? As Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to build momentum, the liberal establishment is in full panic mode. All of the superficial criticism they have cast at Sanders--that he's an old white man who has been a Democrat for barely a minute--apply just as equally to Bloomberg. But what is most critically important to Bloomberg's backers is that his politics are the polar opposite of Sanders. Just days after the disastrous Iowa caucuses, the Washington Post's <mark>Eugene Robinson</mark> bizarrely declared Bloomberg\" the biggest winner, \"even though he skipped the caucuses. <mark>Robinson</mark>'s reasoning was that\" the chaos in the Democratic Party and <mark>Trump</mark>'s White House are making Bloomberg's argument for him. \"The New York Times' Thomas Friedman this week opined that Bloomberg\" has the best chance to carry the day \"in a match-up against <mark>Trump</mark> and that he is\" a moderate progressive with a heart of gold but the toughness of a rattlesnake. \"The words\" moderate progressive \"are code for\" not a Democratic Socialist like Bernie Sanders. \"Defenders of the establishment are terrified that in a bid to sweep away <mark>Trump</mark> and his policies, too many Americans will want to strip wealthy liberals of their power and money as well. For all the fears that Democrats have about a Sanders' nomination, the worst that <mark>Trump</mark> could accuse Sanders of doing is sticking to a set of economic, racial and gender justice principles for 40 years. He could harp on Sanders' avowed socialism, but polls show Americans are actually quite receptive to socialism. He could lie and call Sanders a communist, but the Senator could retort, as he has already done,\" Obviously I am not a communist, \"even if <mark>Trump</mark>\" maybe doesn't know the difference. \"In demonizing Sanders and all he represents, <mark>Trump</mark> is siding with the likes of former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who is so terrified of Sanders he worried the senator would\" ruin the economy \"as president. By that comment, Blankfein of course means that Sanders plans to upend an economy that is working very well for him and terribly for the rest of us. <mark>Trump</mark>, Wall Street executives and wealthy elites like Blankfein and Bloomberg are all arrayed against threats to the corporate stranglehold on America. They are all part of the same team, and yet establishment Democrats claim there is a difference between <mark>Trump</mark> and Bloomberg. As Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren dip in the polls, Bloomberg's numbers are rising. In a head-to-head matchup with <mark>Trump</mark>, one poll showed him beating the president by the widest margin of all Democratic candidates. But Bloomberg has so far benefitted from scant media coverage and as journalists dig deeper, his many skeletons are tumbling out of the closet. He has also not yet faced his challengers on a debate stage. If he does cinch the nomination, picture <mark>Trump</mark> ripping him apart over his comments about crime in minority neighborhoods and his patronizing attitudes toward poor people. Sanders surrogate Nina Turner, in a recent interview on MSNBC, dared to call Bloomberg an\" oligarch \"and raised the ire of liberal pundits. But the word\" oligarch \"is defined as a member of a nation's economic elite unfairly using their status and money to wield power. Former Labor secretary and popular progressive author Robert Reich explained that, yes, at this stage, anyone is better than <mark>Trump</mark> and that\" [o] ligarchy is better than tyranny. \"But, he added,\" neither is as good as democracy. \"Bloomberg's immense wealth allows him to bypass the traditional reins of accountability that the public has over a candidate running for election. Bloomberg doesn't need the public to donate to his campaign, and therefore there is no guarantee that as president he would care about serving the public. Already with <mark>Trump</mark> in the White House, we are suffering the ill effects of an unaccountable wealthy person who cares more about his money than his country. How can anyone who wants to defeat <mark>Trump</mark> want to replace him with someone not unlike him? Sonali Kolhatkar Columnist Sonali Kolhatkar is a columnist for Truthdig.

actors. in 1998, he accepted the role of disgruntled conspiracy theorist with a gun in enemy of the state. the film proved to be a radical departure from <mark>smith</mark>'s prior work, and box office revenues reflected it. <mark>smith</mark> followed this disappointment with arguably his worst career move: the actor opted out of the role of neo in the matrix in favor of doing wild wild west. when later asked about this utterly terrible decision, <mark>will smith</mark> simply replied that the part of neo \"wasn't disgruntled enough .\" after the utter failure of west, <mark>smith</mark> would have a quiet 2000, before almost killing his career for good the following year. in 2001, film auteur <mark>michael mann</mark> approached <mark>smith</mark> with his project <mark>ali</mark>, an ambitious bio-epic about legendary boxer <mark>mohammad ali</mark>. at first, <mark>smith</mark> was reticent about accepting the role, as <mark>ali</mark> was not comically but dramatically disgruntled, and lacked a firearm. however, the actor finally accepted. though the film earned him a surprise oscar nomination for best actor, the film - like almost all good movies - achieved merely an adequate box office performance. <mark>smith</mark>'s agent quickly dropped him, and the actor's career looked like it was finished. <mark>smith</mark> would have to go back to his roots to find success, which, in the realm of hollywood blockbusters, meant doing a sequel. 2002-present: back in form <mark>will smith</mark>, seen here in box office hit i am legend, with gun. following the <mark>ali</mark> debacle, <mark>will smith</mark> did back-to-back sequels to revive his slumping career. in 2002, he reprised his role of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a laser gun in men in black ii, and the following year went back to where it all began with bad boys 2 and another classic portrayal of disgruntled low-level authority figure with a gun. now with two back-to-back hits and $35 million from said hits under his belt, <mark>smith</mark> was free to explore the limits his typecast would allow him to go. in 2004, <mark>smith</mark> played disgruntled low-level authority figure with a gun and a prejudice against robots in i, robot, which proved to be yet another success. <mark>smith</mark> followed up the success of i, robot with his acclaimed portrayal of disgruntled scientist with a gun in i am legend and disgruntled homeless man with super powers in hancock, both being sizeable financial successes. future plans much speculation exists as to what new career <mark>will smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> use his hollywood success to parlay himself into. some believe that <mark>smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> use his notable-though-moderate acting success to inexplicably parlay himself into politics, a la ronald reagan. most hollywood demographers, however, are of the opinion that <mark>will smith</mark>'s charisma and appeal to men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 <mark>will</mark> eventually lead him into running a religious cult. in any event, one thing is certain: <mark>will smith</mark> <mark>will</mark> achieve levels of success and recognition far higher than what his actual level of talent would preclude. see also hollywood angelina jolie keanu reeves michael bay money retrieved from \"\"category: actors"}, {"articleID": "2019032516_00456918_W", "names": {"Manmohan Singh": ["Q17019633", "Q41914", "Q47205876"]}, "date": "2019-03-25", "url": "https://ktvq.com/cnn-asia-pacific/2019/03/25/kashmir-fast-facts/", "content": "Kashmir Fast Facts Here's a look at Kashmir, a region in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges. India, Pakistan and China all claim partial or complete ownership of Kashmir. Facts: Kashmir is an 86,000-square mile region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The separatist violence has killed more than 47,000 people, which does not include people who have disappeared due to the conflict. Some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the death toll at twice that amount. India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir since both countries gained their independence in 1947. The Line of Control separating Indian - and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir is 435 miles (700 km) long. India-controlled: One state, called Jammu and Kashmir, makes up the southern and eastern portions of the region, totaling about 45% of Kashmir. Pakistan-controlled: Three areas called Azad Kashmir, Gilgit and Baltistan make up the northern and western portions of the region, totaling about 35% of Kashmir. China-controlled: One area called Aksai Chin in the northeastern part of the region, equaling 20% of Kashmir. India also alleges Pakistan has ceded 3,220 square miles in Kashmir to China. Srinagar is the summer capital city in Jammu and Kashmir state. Jammu is the winter capital. The capital of Azad Kashmir is Muzaffarabad. Kashmir: India and Pakistan's bitter dispute Timeline: August 15, 1947--India and Pakistan gain independence from Great Britain.

February 26, 2019--Pakistan has promised retaliation \"at the time and place of its choosing\" after India conducts airstrikes on an alleged terrorist training camp inside Pakistan territory, in a significant escalation of hostilities between the nuclear armed powers, in the first such incursion by Indian air force planes since the India-Pakistan war of 1971."}, {"articleID": "2008110907_00009835_W", "names": {"William Gibson": ["Q14945714", "Q18821929", "Q188987", "Q20807634", "Q980844"], "Michael Jackson": ["Q2831", "Q3308266", "Q3856193", "Q43131943", "Q522680", "Q54951747", "Q57260185", "Q5826003", "Q6831552", "Q6831553", "Q6831554", "Q6831555", "Q6831556", "Q6831557", "Q6831558", "Q6831563", "Q6831564", "Q6831566", "Q92948"]}, "date": "2008-11-09", "url": "http://thenodalpoint.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/hello-world/", "content": "that spooky post-geographic feeling. my two favorite sci fi writers have quit writing about the future. my second favorite's magnum opus is set 300 years ago. spook country, by <mark>william gibson</mark>, is set in the present. or last year, anyway. neal stephenson hasn't published a book set in the future since 1995. it's been since 1999 for <mark>gibson</mark>. the new one, spook country, is one of the most enjoyable new reads i've had in a couple of years. <mark>gibson</mark> only puts out a book once every three or four years, so i've learned to take my time with his stuff. i spent about a week reading it, then immediately listened to the audio book, read by this guy robertson dean, who seems to be the pinnacle of evolution of a breed of human born specifically to read spook country out loud. there's a guy named milgrim who's hooked on prescription tranquilizers and must translate text messages in faux cyrillic for his captor, who may or may not be a federal agent. there's a cuban-chinese keyboard player kid who's been trained in the soviet martial art of systema. there's an ex rock star turned journalist working for a magazine that doesn't exist yet. none of that matters, because it's not the point. it's the world <mark>gibson</mark>'s describing that matters, the world of google and of wikipedia and 9-11 and pop culture, and the way he presents it, in these thoughtful and evocative two or three page chapters that mates art with gps, marketing and electronic espionage, slow motion and the cliffhanger. what does it mean, though? sci fi writers writing about the present and past. does it signify anything to you? to me, it speaks of a certain vision of the future arriving and while being familiar, doesn't resemble the predictions you've been expecting. <mark>gibson</mark>, in the documentary no maps for these territories, talks about those futures that didn't come to be, the \"future with a capital f, that was being planned, that the future was gonna happen because grownups were making decisions .\" that's paraphrased, but you get the point. the other future, is the future of pat frank's alas babylon that of the atomic apocalypse, where the world has come to an end. it seems that the future has arrived and the grown ups in charge aren't making great decisions, and the world hasn't ended in a firestorm yet. indeed, <mark>gibson</mark> says that the future may be unknowable, and perhaps that is the reason he examines our present so well. spook country is about family, outsourced spies, life after fame, and the sprint of technology into niche after niche, and it is fucking masterful. the present has never looked quite so shiny, gritty and cool. so the apocalypse didn't happen and we ain't getting jetpacks or teleporters. the next revolutions are happening so fast it's only barely possible to keep up with them in fiction, much less start making predictions, is that what's going on? <mark>gibson</mark> talks about things that \"up the ante\" for a sci fi writer, like, a \"when it was confirmed that <mark>michael jackson</mark> was gonna marry elvis presley's daughter, that\" truth is stranger than fiction' factor keeps getting jacked up on us on a fairly regular, maybe even exponential basis. and that's something that's peculiar to our time, i don't think our parents had to deal with that. \"it's funny,\" the present \"of <mark>gibson</mark>'s virtual light was almost three years ago and remains relevant, stephenson's cryptonomicon is set in 1999, and still has much to teach us about the need for data havens (can anyone say\" the pirate bay \"?) and crytopgraphy (which you had to use just to read this .). that future and that present are now past, and it seems our present will outpace us and may outpace our children. how you deal with it and your awareness of whatever portion of modernity you're feel like grasping seems to be what matters. we're not going to get to the shiny, polished future we imagined, and i think we all pretty much agreed on that when our petroleum wars began. it'll come at us from the past, which is stephenson's point in much of his latest work, and it'll come at us from like three days ago with some short article or a five second clip they didn't have enough time for on the news because they're busy revising the official story of our recent past."}]
