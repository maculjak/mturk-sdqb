Travel Airfares are about to get more expensive by Lauren McMah 6th Jun 2018 3:26 PM BAD news, budget travellers: the price of flights is about to get more expensive, according to the bosses of several major airlines. At an annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Sydney this week, a hot topic for airline bosses and delegates has been the skyrocketing price of oil, which is at its highest since 2014 - and rising at a faster rate than ticket prices. With fuel making up around 25 per cent of an airline's costs, they will be forced to drive up the price of their fares to cope, American Airlines chief executive officer <mark>Doug Parker</mark> warned. He added that as carriers looked at ways to drive fuel efficiency, they may also consider reducing the capacity of their aircraft - which may mean there are fewer seats to pick from, Fortune reports. It's not the first time Mr <mark>Parker</mark>, who leads the world's largest airline, has warned about having to pass on the rising cost of fuel to passengers. \"Oil is our second-largest expense. So when it increases, the cost of air travel increases,\" he said in April. \"I would expect you would see higher fares to consumers over time.\" Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon echoed that warning in Sydney this week. \"At this point with rising fuel, you control costs, raise prices and you may have some fall off in demand and reduce capacity,\" Mr Luxon told Reuters. The boss of American Airlines has been warning for months that passengers may have to start wearing the skyrocketing cost of fuel. Picture: Lynne Sladky/Associated Press \"I think we are seeing pricing move up internationally and certainly yields come up as well.\" Brent crude is trading at around $99 a barrel, up nearly 50 percent from a year ago, Reuters reports. Some airline companies, such as China Eastern Airlines, have signalled plans to hedge oil while others, like Emirates and Delta, ruled it out. Aviation chiefs and economists at the IATA conference suggested hedging did not avoid the inevitable impact of rising fuel costs. \"Whilst most of us have hedging in place, that hedging eventually runs out or gets replaced by new positions you have got, and it is a question then of what do you do?\" Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd CEO John Borghetti told Reuters. \"If you look at history, typically some of that cost has to be passed on at some point because you just simply can't absorb it.\" Between mid-2014 and early 2015, lower oil prices ushered in an era of lower airfares and bigger growth for airlines. This year, the price of oil is expected to average more than $91.40 a barrel. The IATA had been expecting it to reach only $78.40. The association has now revised its estimated overall industry profits to $44.6 billion, which is 12 per cent lower than it originally forecast in December. \"We have seen a rise in the fuel cost now for almost 15 months,\" IATA chief executive officer Alexandre de Juniac said. \"Usually you see an impact on fares 10 to 12 months after, but for the moment I have to say the fuel increase has not been passed on in fares.\" Will it happen? Mr de Juniac said that was up to the airlines. \"It is also an individual decision by each airline to decide whether or not they want to increase the fares to reflect the increase in fuel costs,\" he said. The lower fuel prices of recent years also helped spur a higher-than-projected growth in passenger demand. That was also likely to change, said Peter Harbison, executive chairman of Sydney's CAPA Centre for Aviation. \"If they are forced to start raising prices, that traffic growth could very quickly disappear at the same time that profits disappear,\" he said. Airline bosses have also voiced concerns labour and infrastructure costs could also contribute to the end of a three-year run of unusually high returns for the airline industry. Still, the IATA expects passenger air travel to expand by 7 per cent in 2018. That rate is more sluggish than the 8.1 per cent growth recorded in 2017, but it's faster than the 20-year average of 5.5 per cent, for the sixth consecutive year. aeroplane Read More Login to follow

mental health unit\" won't hit homes bid' a multi-million pound day hospital for older mental patients will not affect future housing developments, claim planners. wrexham maelor hospital wants to build a two-storey older adult mental health unit off the northern side of croesnewydd road, close to hospital residential accommodation. it will have 28 in-patient beds and a 16-place day hospital and therapy spaces and will go before wrexham county borough council's planning committee on monday for approval. the proposal includes minor amendments to the site plan already approved for the adult mental health unit which adjoins the site. but concerns have been raised that the plans may compromise the application for housing nearby by morris homes. objectors claim the proposals are \"unclear\" and the scale, mass, bulk and character of the multi-storey could compromise the adjacent land the suspended ramp to the car park is described as unconventional and may raise health and safety concerns and could compromise problems of flooding on adjacent land. the car park should be set back to ensure no risk of flooding. but wrexham planners said: \"the building is of a high quality design and existing and proposed landscaping will ensure it is not overly dominant.\" they say it is also environmentally friendly. highway engineers are also satisfied it will not make traffic congestion worse. \"a previous permission allowed a two tiered decking system and this proposal seeks to provide an additional four levels,\" say planners. \"concern has been expressed from owners/developers of adjoining land at maesgwyn road that the car park may impact on future development which is subject of a current application. given the height of the development, proposed and existing screening and the distances to proposed development, over 60m, the car park will not have any significant impact on future residential amenity or in the wider landscape,\" say planners. meanwhile full details of a proposal for a residential care home for 72 elderly mentally infirm residents, on the former jacques garage site off mold road, will also go before the council for approval subject to conditions. the site, close to wrexham general station, was previously approved for apartments. but with little interest in regenerating the site for housing, planners believe the scheme would be an ideal opportunity to develop a key site near wrexham's town centre. the report to councillors said: \"the current application is one of two outline applications for extra care and emi residential care home on the former jacques site.\" a partnership between pennaf housing group and the council has submitted a formal bid to the welsh assembly government to provide \"social housing grant' for the new extra care scheme.\" this bid is currently under consideration and it is anticipated funding will be approved this year. \"a key part of this scheme is the close relationship of the new extra care scheme and the care home is that certain aspects of the accommodation will be closely linked and shared between the two developments.\" keep up to date with the news. sign up for news

The tree farm for the park was planted last summer. Conceptual plans have been in the works for some time, with a proposed park featuring the tree farm, gardens, storage sheds, benches, lighting, a stone wall, gazebo, pergola, a stone dust trail and an outdoor classroom. The borough purchased the land for the park in 2009 for $425,000 with a county Open Space grant. During a Borough Council work session on Aug. 3, the council discussed moving forward with the first two phases of the project. <mark>Thomas Miller</mark>, the consultant on the project, and Recreation Director Bobbi Conway presented bid options to the council. \"What we're looking at is a phase 2 application for Bergen County Open Space,\" Conway said, estimating that the subtotal for the entire project would be approximately $140,000. The grant from Bergen County for open space would be about $70,000, with the borough then responsible for the remaining $70,000, according to Conway. <mark>Miller</mark> said during the first phase, fencing right beside the school would be installed. The base items in the bid would include pole-mounted lighting, accessible parking spaces, irrigation systems and landscaping. Additional items for the park would include an entrance walkway overlay, pergola, low stone wall and a gazebo. <mark>Miller</mark> said although they considered including an outdoor classroom and storage shed in the original plan, the items were left out of the subtotal of the cost and considered additions to the project. These two items would cost an approximate additional $19,000. Councilman Edward Mignone said that officials could not guarantee that they would receive the $70,000 grant from the county and they should consider that when setting aside funding for the project. Mignone said that the approximate cost would turn out be higher, approximately $157,000 plus 10 percent contingency, permits and other fees. \"So we're probably looking at total costs of $200,000,\" he said. \"This is the issue: We're asking for $70,000 with a $70,000 match, but the allocations on the county level are down 40 percent this year. Last year the region got $464,000. This year our region is getting $290,000. So it's more likely we're going to get $25,000 instead of $70,000.\" What I'm concerned about, and we ran into this problem with another project, is we're going to be proposing a $200,000 project, \"he continued.\" We're going to get $20,000 and we're going to commit ourselves to spending the full $200,000 and that money is not available. I'm not prepared to go for a $70,000 grant and then go and spend $200,000 plus on this project. \"Mayor Sandy Moscaritolo said that the council would take a vote on going out for the grant application with the understanding that the details and specifics of the park could be changed, if necessary.\" We can certainly complete the project in a third phase if we need to, \"he said.\" The matching fund will most likely come from the local open space fund that we've already established and we can always lower our expectations. \"Conway said she discussed it with the Recreation Commission and they approved the project and the estimate.\" Actually this is the only project that we have open to go out for open space for the county, \"Conway said.\" This is the only project that we're working on right now. \"The resolution endorsing the council to go for the next round of the open space application was passed. Mignone was the only dissenting vote. Councilman Anthony Cappola was not present at the meeting. Mignone said he voted\" no \"because the governing body does not know the full scope of the project and would be earmarking $70,000. The council also voted to accept the lowest bid for the first phase of the project."}, {"articleID": "2014052913_00074808_W", "names": {"Clint Eastwood": ["Q2979323", "Q43203"]}, "date": "2014-05-29", "url": "http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/05/29/4014918.htm", "content": "Running from death's door as dialysis patient aims for a triathlon Jervis Bay's <mark>Clint Eastwood</mark> is training to become Australia's first triathlete on dialysis. (ABC: Justin Huntsdale) <mark>Clint Eastwood</mark> has heard all the jokes about his movie star namesake, but you probably haven't heard about how he hauled himself out of a darkness that was set to claim his life, and started training to be Australia's first triathlete on dialysis. \"At Christmas time, things were bad health-wise - I was living on pain killers, my conditions were flaring up and I couldn't walk so I was sleeping all the time and in a wheelchair.\" I decided after going through [over 30 years of] this horrible stuff, I'd finally had enough and it had just become too much. \"So he drove to Melbourne to tell his family that he was throwing in the towel after a long and difficult fight with kidney failure. Just one week away from his blood cleaning dialysis machine would've been enough to end his life.\" I got to Melbourne and no one wants to deal with stuff like that, I mean, how do you tell your own mother you don't want to be here anymore? \"On the cusp having that conversation, he says he had a\" light bulb moment' and realised that instead of quitting on life, he would seize what he calls his last throw of the dice. He chose to become a triathlete, inspired by reading the story of American dialysis patient Shad Ireland who did the same thing. \"Reading his story ignited a spark in me, then seeing stuff on Facebook of kids with no legs, blind athletes, and paralympians, I wondered what the hell am I whinging about?\" To be fair, he has a right to whinge. Diagnosed with kidney failure at age three, he's had three failed kidney transplants, was told a fourth would kill him, and was also told he wouldn't make 40 years of age. He has trouble finding employment because his dialysis treatment forces him to be connected to a machine that cleans his blood in a hospital, three days a week for five hours per session. \"I do it myself - it's like part time work but without the pay.\" But remarkably he still has a sense of humour about it all, and that's probably been enhanced with his fitness kick. He left Melbourne early and drove back to the Shoalhaven of southern New South Wales and signed up at a gym before he went home. \"I've lost 17.5 kilograms since January and people have noticed a physical and mental change in me,\" he says. \"You only live once and whether you have a long time or a short time, it's about making the most of the time you have.\" Stop wasting time and sitting there thinking woe is me and enjoy what you've got, particularly up here [in Wollongong]. \"He's at the gym several times a week (around his dialysis treatment), has started surfing and has received sponsorship from local businesses to help pay for his fitness equipment.\" All I'm trying to do is be proud of something I've done."}, {"articleID": "2011052309_00051349_W", "names": {"Volen Siderov": ["Q12960523", "Q351040"], "Orhan Pamuk": ["Q241248", "Q53091976"]}, "date": "2011-05-23", "url": "http://novinite.com/view_news.php?id=128527", "content": "the nationalists' rally at a sofia mosque last friday quickly escalated to a serious clash. photo by the ethnic turkish party, movement for rights and freedom, dps, is going to inform all european institutions about the actions of the far-right, nationalist ataka party. the announcement was made by the dps parliamentary group deputy chair, yunal lyutvi, who spoke for the bulgarian national radio, bnr, saying the information is to reach the council of europe, the human rights agency at the european commission and the european parliament. last friday ataka staged a rally in front of the sofia's banya bashi mosque, protesting the fact it has loudspeakers that sound muslim prayers in the entire area around. the rally escalated to a fight with injured and detained people. ataka leader, <mark>volen siderov</mark>, claims those at the mosque are islamic extremists and terrorists. \"<mark>siderov</mark> is detrimental for bulgaria,\" lyutvi declared, adding the bulgaria might ban nationalist party \"ataka' for stirring hatred bulgarian pm on xenophobic outburst: don't worry, that's just campaigning! how significant do you take to be the incident in which activists of the nationalist and far-right right party ataka assaulted praying muslims in the banya bashi mosque in downtown sofia? the incident is a very grave foreboding of the overall situation religious and ethnic violence that can occur in bulgaria unless it is taken seriously by the state and society. one should not read too much into this incident because the attack was staged by several dozen far-right activists who are not representative of the bulgarian society. nobel prize winner <mark>orhan pamuk</mark> with highest bulgarian award why is bulgarian nationalist <mark>siderov</mark> not shouting? a: i am watching bulgarian nationalist leader <mark>volen siderov</mark> on tv right now, but i cannot hear him violently ranting against turks. something must be wrong! all rights reserved? novinite ltd., 2001-2011."}, {"articleID": "2019101509_00053201_W", "names": {"Thomas Cook": ["Q16205324", "Q47452628", "Q53952787"], "Peter Fankhauser": ["Q18686096", "Q23656762"]}, "date": "2019-10-15", "url": "http://northwalespioneer.co.uk/news/national/17969004.ex-thomas-cook-boss-deeply-sorry-firms-failure/", "content": "Ex-Thomas <mark>Cook</mark> boss \"deeply sorry' over firm's failure By Press Association 2019 <mark>Peter Fankhauser</mark> 0 comment The former boss of <mark>Thomas Cook</mark> has said he is\" deeply sorry \"for the travel firm's collapse. Ex-chief executive <mark>Peter Fankhauser</mark> told MPs that senior figures at the company regretted being unable to save the\" iconic brand \". Employees, customers and suppliers are among those affected by the failure of the firm. Mr <mark>Fankhauser</mark> is one of five senior <mark>Thomas Cook</mark> figures giving evidence to the Commons' Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. In his opening remarks, he said:\" You heard me probably say it already, but I really want to repeat it in front of the members of the select committee, how deeply sorry we are that we couldn't save this iconic brand and this company who has a long, long standing history in this part of the UK industry.

Former <mark>Thomas Cook</mark> bosses at the hearing (House of Commons/PA) \"I'm especially sorry for all my colleagues who worked extremely hard and tirelessly to make <mark>Thomas Cook</mark> a better company.\" But MPs were quick to call into question some of the accounting policies including the decision to include a \u00a3 2.5 billion \"goodwill\" value on the business in 2018. They also asked the bosses why they based bonuses on profits that excluded one-off payments to pay for the restructuring. A total of \u00a3 1.8 billion was written as \"exceptional\" costs over eight years. Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: \"The proof of the pudding is somewhat in the eating and you failed to turn around this business. In the end you couldn't just hide these numbers (exceptionals) forever, they caught up with you.\" She also called the former <mark>Thomas Cook</mark> chairman Frank Meysman \"deluded\" over the collapse. Ms Reeves added: \"You can point to as many successes as you like but you have brought down a 178-year business with huge repercussions for customers, staff and taxpayers. You can point to the successes but I'll point to the failures and they hugely outweigh the successes you've spoken about. I think you're deluded Mr Meysman about the business you ran.\" 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2016092400_00183968_W", "names": {"Keith Edwards": ["Q18165711", "Q6384307", "Q6384308", "Q6384309", "Q6384310"]}, "date": "2016-09-23", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2016/09/23/two-indicted-on-attempted-murder-charges-following-augusta-wal-mart-parking-lot-shooting-incident/", "content": "AUGUSTA--Two men accused of shooting handguns at each other in the parking lot at Wal-Mart during an altercation that ended when armed bystanders intervened were indicted Friday on charges including attempted murder. Frankie Dejesus, 27, of Augusta, was indicted on charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and reckless conduct with a firearm. Reginald McBride, 45, of Harlem, New York, was indicted on charges of attempted murder, aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs, reckless conduct with a firearm, and four counts of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The indictments stem from a June 26 shooting and fight a judge described as \"like an old Western shoot-out in the Wal-Mart parking lot.\" Frankie Dejesus Samantha Tupper Diana Davis REginald McBride Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192 Also indicted Friday, in connection to the same incident, were Samantha E. Tupper, 24, of Augusta, on charges of unlawful furnishing of scheduled drugs and hindering apprehension or prosecution, and Diana M. Davis, 29, of Rochester, New York, on a charge of aggravated assault. An indictment is not a determination of guilt, but it indicates that there is enough evidence to proceed with formal charges and a trial. Police say McBride and Dejesus fired guns at each other during a dispute about money in the parking lot of the Augusta Wal-Mart, though no one was struck by a bullet during the altercation. An affidavit by Augusta Police Detective Brian Wastella says Tupper had been driving in a Ford Taurus to Wal-Mart when she picked up McBride on Mount Vernon Avenue. A car with three women passengers in it, and Dejesus driving, approached them. Two of the women got out and got into Tupper's vehicle, and both vehicles went to Wal-Mart, parking side by side. All the people got out of both vehicles. Wastella said McBride, Tupper, Dejesus and Davis argued. McBride said Tupper and he got back into the Taurus when \"he observed Dejesus point a handgun out the driver's side of his vehicle at him. McBride stated in fear of being shot, McBride drew his handgun and began firing at Dejesus,\" Wastella wrote. Dejesus, meanwhile, told police McBride pulled the gun first and began shooting, so Dejesus began firing back. Wastella said McBride got out of the car when the shooting stopped and began fighting with Dejesus and Davis, with the two beating on him. Tupper told police Dejesus hit McBride with the butt of a gun while Davis held him. Then, according to police accounts of the incident, two bystanders, both legally armed with guns, broke up the confrontation, taking out their guns and telling the suspects to stop fighting. Tupper and McBride drove away before police arrived. Police later found them at Tupper's residence, on Mayflower Road. Wastella said police found 42 grams of heroin on McBride. The indictment for McBride notes he \"did intentionally or knowingly shoot at Frankie Dejesus,\" while Dejesus' indictment likewise states he \"did intentionally or knowingly shoot at Reginald McBride.\" McBride's indictment indicates, regarding the four counts of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, that McBride was convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in Virginia in 1996. The indictment states McBride owned, possessed or controlled four firearms--two .22 caliber handguns, a .32 caliber handgun, and a 9 millimeter handgun. Davis' indictment states she caused bodily injury to McBride, with the use of a firearm. While no one was shot in the incident, McBride suffered lacerations to his head, which police said was from being hit by the butt of a gun during the fight that ensued after four shots were fired. <mark>Keith Edwards</mark>--621-5647 [email protected] Twitter: @ kedwardskj Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?
