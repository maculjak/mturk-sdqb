For some players, it's a welcome opportunity to see some old friends, reminisce about good memories, and try to beat them. But for others, it's a personal grudge match - An opportunity to stick it to an organization that let you go. Fortunately, Carolina Panthers wide receiver falls into the former category. Now in Carolina after a one-year stint with the Philadelphia Eagles, Smith is a welcome face in what is usually a hostile environment for opposing teams to play in - That'll happen when you're a member of the Eagles' first-ever Super Bowl-winning team. Torrey Smith \"\"said Smith of returning to Philadelphia in a report by Jelani Scott of the Panthers .\" I'm the only one who hasn't been able to see it yet. \"I can't wait to see the (Super Bowl LII Champions) banner, Although the Eagles opted during the offseason not to make Smith a part of their plans moving forward, trading him to the Panthers instead, Smith continues to speak highly of his former team. And, in return, Eagles head coach spoke highly of him. Doug Pederson\" \"said Pederson .\" I think that's the same thing he's doing in Carolina ....He's a great leader - A great man, first of all. Good person ....He is explosive and he can make plays on the ball and down the field. That's what helped us a year ago win a championship. \"I'm so grateful for what Torrey did and what he brought to this football team with his leadership ability, Although Smith had a quiet first month as a Panther, he is coming off of his best performance of the season against the Washington Redskins. While he didn't get the ball until the fourth quarter, Smith ended up catching all five of his targets for 43 yards and a touchdown, as well as a two-point conversion. Smith acting when called upon, in addition to his veteran leadership and the way he conducts himself, factors in to why quarterback referred to Smith as a\" pro \". <mark>Cam Newton</mark>\" \"said <mark>Newton</mark>.\" This is a production-based league, this is a production-based society. When those opportunities came to him, he made the most of them. And we wouldn't have expected anything else from him because of his whole approach. No one cares that he didn't get any passes thrown to him (until) the fourth quarter, Bring well-traveled in the course of his NFL career, Smith brings a wealth of perspective to the Panthers' Week Seven match: He's played in Philadelphia as a member of the Eagles, and as a member of the visiting team.

Bangash / AP When the whole world is fighting for the same jobs, what happens to workers? Load Error You can buy almost any thing you want online--toothpaste, books, plastic devices that allow you to lick your cat. On digital work platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.com, you can also buy nearly any service--often from someone halfway around the world, sometimes for just a few bucks. On Fiverr, one of the most popular of these platforms, you'll find offers for someone who will write an Ebook \"on any topic\" ; a person who will perform \"a Voiceover as Bernie Sanders\" ; someone who will write your Tinder profile for you, and someone who will design a logo for your real estate company. The people selling this labor live in Nigeria, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Bangladesh, respectively. Each of them charge $5 for these tasks. For buyers, the appeal of these sites is obvious: They're a great place to find skilled and semi-skilled sellers willing to work for cheap. They track when work has been completed, allow sellers to rate workers, and provide staff who can help resolve disputes. The people selling their skills win, too: workers--especially those living overseas--can make a decent amount of money being paid in US dollars. The proliferation of online freelance job sites have allowed some people to leave poorly paying jobs in their home countries; it also allows students and those with little experience to sell their work, get good reviews, and start cultivating clients. It's free to list services on most of these sites, and once freelancers start getting reviews--which they can get from actual clients, or from friends who buy their service, or from people through \"Fiverr review' or other such Facebook groups--other buyers trust them and hire them. More than 48 million people have registered globally on websites allowing them to sell their labor. Optimistic about the potential of the digital economy to lift people from poverty, countries like Malaysia and Nigeria have embarked on campaigns to train residents in how to use online labor platforms; Malaysia aims to have 340,000 workers, mostly from the bottom 40 percent of income earners, make a living from online freelancing by 2020. The global digital labor force will only continue to grow: Nearly a quarter of a billion people came online for the first time last year, and about 4 billion people, more than half of the world's population, now have internet access. In 2016, the World Bank estimated that the global market for online freelancing was $4.4 billion. But while freelance websites may have raised wages and broadened the number of potential employers for some people, they've forced every new worker who signs up into entering a global marketplace with endless competition, low wages, and little stability. Decades ago, the only companies that outsourced work overseas were multinational corporations with the resources to set up manufacturing shops elsewhere. Now, independent businesses and individuals are using the power of the internet to find the cheapest services in the world too, and it's not just manufacturing workers who are seeing the downsides to globalization. All over the country, people like graphic designers and voice-over artists and writers and marketers have to keep lowering their rates to compete .\" There really is a race to the bottom effect going on here, because there's so much of an oversupply of workers, \"<mark>Mark Graham</mark>, a professor of internet geography at the Oxford Internet Institute, told me. <mark>Graham</mark> and his colleagues have been conducting an extensive study of the digital economy, interviewing hundreds of digital workers and analyzing data about tens of thousands of projects. They found that most buyers are located in high-income countries like the U.S., and most sellers are in countries such as India, Nigeria, and the Philippines. While digital labor markets are intended to allow sellers to auction off their work to whoever will pay the highest price for it, <mark>Graham</mark> and his Oxford colleagues Isis Hjorth and Vili Lehdonvirta found that they also help buyers find the cheapest sellers. The Internet Is Enabling a New Kind of Poorly Paid Hell\" Rates are way too low, but it's how it works, \"Jelena, a 17-year-old in Serbia who lists services on Fiverr.com, told me. (The Atlantic is not publishing her last name because Fiverr prohibits users from sharing email addresses and personal details, as she did with me .)\" Whoever offers the lowest price, gets the job. \"Jelena will translate 1,000 words from Serbian to English, or make a PowerPoint presentation, or even\" write a beautiful love letter \"for just $5 a pop. Fiverr takes about 20 percent of that, and then she gets charged a PayPal fee, so she ends up with about $3 for each service, she told me.

USA TODAY 1:26 UP NEXT I encountered Jelena when I logged onto Fiverr, and, curious about the quality of the stuff I could buy for just $5, hired her a few other freelancers to do some tasks. For just $7--$5 plus a $2 service fee charged by Fiverr--Jelena wrote a 200-word love letter for me. It was great: I told her that my fictional paramour and I had been dating for 161 days, and she added up those digits, which equal the number eight, and made a reference to how flipping an\" 8 \"on its side would lead to the infinity sign .\" I wannaflip that 8 to the left and spend it with you, \"she wrote. Fiverr was founded in 2010 to take some of the\" friction \"out of the process of finding and working with a freelancer, making it as easy to buy labor as it is to buy a T-shirt online. In a statement, spokesperson Sam Katzen described it as\" a global community that enables anyone to be a doer. \"Freelancers have been allowed to charge more than $5 since 2015, and they are increasingly raising their rates: Just 5 percent of services cost $5, according to Katzen. Last year, Fiverr introduced a tier called Fiverr Pro that\" hand-picks \"high-quality workers who charge more, Katzer said. While I found many logo designers listing their services for $5 on Fiverr, the Fiverr Pro designers charged much more, from $375 and up. Digital freelance sites each work a little differently. On Fiverr, buyers and sellers correspond through the platform anonymously and are not supposed to exchange email addresses or phone numbers, a rule designed to ensure that people won't connect off the platform and thus hire one another without Fiverr getting a cut. Anyone can create a profile and begin selling their services right away, but they don't have to upload a photo of themselves, or enter their education qualifications or use their real name. Because people are restricted from exchanging too much information about themselves, it can be hard to know who you're hiring. One of the workers I hired to write a Christian-themed blog post for $5 had a profile that listed her name as\" Deborah Hutton. \"It said that she was a\" journalist by training, \"and it featured a picture of a young white woman in glasses looking at a laptop, smiling. But when I did a reverse Google image search of the photo, I found it was actually an Adobe stock photo, titled\" Happy woman using laptop at caf\u00e9. \"And the name Deborah Hutton is the same as that of an English journalist for Vogue who died in 2005. When I asked\" Deborah \"if that was really her name, she did not write back. Fiverr listed her location as Nigeria. (Sites like Upwork, by contrast, require workers to submit an application that includes a real photo, their qualifications, and schooling .) The internet makes all workers equal; there's no way for a buyer to know who really is sitting behind the computer doing the work. This is a boon for many. <mark>Graham</mark> talked to people who did not have legal immigration status in the countries where they lived, but were still able to earn a living online, and older workers who had lost their jobs, but had disguised their age and finding work. But that also means similarly talented people can charge equal rates, regardless of their actual qualifications, even if they live in countries that have vastly different costs of living--and that Americans and other skilled workers in the developed world have a particularly hard time competing. That's partly why the Harvard economist Richard B. Freeman warned more than a decade ago that the growth of the global workforce, with its proliferation of educated workers everywhere,\" presents the U.S. economy with the greatest challenge since the Great Depression. \"Monika Taylor lives in the United States and offers psychic readings for $5 on Fiverr to supplement her full-time job. She had mostly been selling her readings on Facebook and Pinterest for about $65 to $85, she told me, but when she stumbled across Fiverr, she figured it was a good way to broaden the number of people she could reach. Though she balked when she saw that others were charging just $5 for psychic readings, she decided to list her services anyway, figuring she could raise rates once she had enough clients. She got a few clients over the last few years, but when she raised her rates recently, to $15 from $5, people stopped buying her readings, she said. Now, she has gone back to mostly selling on other platforms .\" If I had to make a living on Fiverr, \"she told me,\" I would be living under a bridge. \"Sellers know that if they complain or ask for more money, there are millions of workers out there who will replace them. They also don't want to ally with other workers and advocate for better working conditions because they see those people as competitors, not colleagues, <mark>Graham</mark> found .\" They don't want to make a fuss, they just want to get a five-star rating, \"<mark>Graham</mark> told me. Many workers are willing to lower their rates beyond what they considered fair, the academics wrote in a paper summing up their research. Of course, many people are having a positive experience in the online digital economy. <mark>Graham</mark> and his colleagues interviewed Arvin, a university professor in Manila, who, at the time he signed up for a digital platform, was frustrated by his low wages and long commute at the university. Once he started selling his services doing search engine optimization, he was able to leave his university job and soon made three times what he had made before--about $600 a month--working just 25-30 hours a week. Another worker, Kim-Ly, who lives in Vietnam, found a data entry job online that paid $8 an hour--about four times what she had made before as an accountant at a bank--that allowed her to travel abroad and buy luxury goods. I also corresponded with Jahanzeb Malik, a 24-year-old Pakistani man who told me he made about $5,000 over two years on Fiverr creating PowerPoint presentations for startups pitching to investors. He did Fiverr while he was in school, and liked having the extra money, he said. He was good at PowerPoints, and he was good at social media, and by answering questions about Fiverr on sites like Quora, he became\" a guru-like figure \"in the community of Fiverr sellers, he told me. That allowed him to launch his own website, NerdsHD.com, where he blogs about the digital economy and sells what he had sold on Fiverr before, but for more money. His work on Fiverr gave him the client list and name recognition to start his own business, he told me. For other workers, though, gigs are too unstable to make a living. The firm that employed Kim-Ly, for instance, reduced her pay to $6 and then closed the project. When she found a new job, it was for just $4 an hour, and she told the researchers she didn't feel comfortable bargaining for better pay. Another study of a different digital work platform in Europe found that the vast majority of people who listed a service were never hired for any gigs. Jelena, the woman from Serbia, told me she's made her peace with the idea that she has to offer the lowest possible rates\" in order to get any jobs at all. \"A woman I hired to write a short story, a 23-year-old who didn't want her name used, lives in Canada, where she is trying to become a writer. She's sold writing on Fiverr since 2015, and told me that while it was hard to get work at first because there were so many sellers to compete with, she now has lots of good reviews, and consistent jobs. The 500 word story she completed for me was funny, succinct, and well-written, but she still charged just $5 for it. After more than three years, she still sees Fiverr as a way to earn some side cash, rather than as a full-time job. Genevieve Hannon used to be a voice actor in New York City, where she was a member of SAG-AFTRA, which meant that she sometimes made $500 for a quick session doing TV voiceover promos. She made about $85,000 to $100,000 a year, she told me. She eventually left the East Coast to become a veterinary tech in Utah, but when she decided to supplement her income by doing voiceover work online, she had to dramatically lower her rates to find work on Fiverr. At first, she charged just $5 for 100 words of script, which made her feel guilty because she knew she was drastically undercutting union rates. When she started getting good reviews, she slowly raised her rates, and eventually made $17,000 one year. But she felt guilty doing work for multinational companies that had previously hired union actors for much more money, she told me. She was stuck: If she rejoined the union, she wouldn't get much work, because so many buyers had gone to digital work sites. But Fiverr didn't earn her as much money. She eventually got kicked off Fiverr for listing her website in a correspondence with a client, she told me, and in the end, she was glad to leave the site .\" It was a real relief to feel like I'm not doing something harmful for the overall good, \"she said. Still, now that she's banned from Fiverr, she's had to resort to other digital work sites to sell her services, which she says don't have the reach of Fiverr. <mark>Graham</mark> has a few suggestions for how these sites can pay better. He suggested forming a global group that could ensure international labor standards are being met, for example. He recently wrote a proposal for a FairWork Foundation, which would give certifications to companies that pay the minimum wage and treat workers fairly. Workers could also form digital picket lines to disrupt employers who don't pay fairly or treat workers well, or they could gather on Reddit or Facebook to share information about better-paid gigs. (Workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk have Turkopticon, for example, a browser plugin that allows users to rate employers .) Some workers in other gig industries have established platform co-ops that allow them to better control rates and working conditions. These changes might not have much of an impact on U.S. and Canadian workers who are competing with people overseas. But paying workers in the developing world better will have a positive effect on everyone else, <mark>Graham</mark> said. A U.S. law requiring that any employer who uses these platforms follow the labor laws in the countries where they're operating could help .\" I guess my only hope within this reality is that we can...raise working conditions for those that currently have bad ones, rather than lowering working conditions for everyone, \"he told me. America has, for a long time, decided that the upsides of outsourcing outweigh the downsides. When U.S. companies first started sending manufacturing jobs overseas, millions of American customers got lower prices for the goods they were buying, which made them a little less concerned about the tens of thousands of people whose manufacturing job had disappeared, but we never did find a way to help the losers of globalization become winners. It's possible that Americans will still decide that this latest wave of outsourcing is, on the whole, beneficial, too. But the usual mantra told to people who have lost their jobs to outsourcing--get more education, get more training--doesn't make sense in an economy where educated people across the world are competing: On Fiverr, I found someone in Pakistan offering to do architectural designs for just $5. This is good news for the many talented people who now have a global platform to sell their services to buyers everywhere. One recent paper has predicted that a\" Matthew effect \"could begin to dominate the global gig economy, in which the most successful workers do better and better. Everyone else, though, is going to do worse."}, {"articleID": "2016042206_00147876_W", "names": {"Paul Mitchell": ["Q20706988", "Q27922634", "Q28819608", "Q30121955", "Q7152553", "Q7152554", "Q7152555", "Q7152556", "Q7152561"], "Pedro S\u00e1nchez": ["Q25414599", "Q6070218"], "Fernando Mart\u00ednez": ["Q18729811", "Q23641785", "Q26267550", "Q3069494", "Q43107614", "Q43654480", "Q5444819", "Q57834387"]}, "date": "2016-04-22", "url": "http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/04/22/spai-a22.html", "content": "World Socialist Web Site Published by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) Podemos pleads with Socialist Party to form a government in Spain By <mark>Paul Mitchell</mark> 22 April 2016 Attempts to form a new government in Spain have stalled, raising the possibility of fresh elections being called. The breakup of the decades-long two-party system in the general election in December left a hung parliament divided among four main parties, the Popular Party (PP), Socialist Party (PSOE), Podemos and Ciudadanos (Citizens). Attempts to cobble together a coalition have repeatedly failed--the most recent being that between the PSOE and Citizens. That pact required the support of Podemos, but to be seen to be cooperating with Citizens would have totally exposed the political pretensions of the pseudo-left party. King Felipe VI is to hold a new round of consultations beginning April 25. Podemos is making a last ditch attempt with pleas to the PSOE to form a so-called \"Government of Change\" that would include the Communist Party-led United Left (IU) and Valencian nationalist Compromis and require the support or abstention of Catalan and Basque nationalists. If a power-sharing agreement is not reached by May 2, new elections will be held on June 26. Polls suggest the voting will be similar to that in December, although the situation is volatile and difficult to predict as 40 percent of voters are still undecided. On Monday, Podemos announced the results of a referendum that was held last week after three-way talks with the PSOE and Citizens broke down. Podemos members were asked two questions: Do you want a Government based on the PSOE-Citizens pact? Do you agree with our proposal for a Government for Change with Podemos, En Com\u00fa Podem (Podemos in Catalonia), and En Marea (a coalition in Galicia involving Podemos, the Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood, the IU and various municipal alliances)? Both options were variants on a coalition with the PSOE. Announcing the results, Podemos Organisation Secretary, Pablo Echenique, declared that of the party's 393,538 registered members just 149,513 (37 percent of the total) voted. Some 88 percent opposed the PSOE-Citizens pact and 92 percent backed the Government of Change proposal. That so few bothered to vote in such a critical decision reveals the true level of commitment among Podemos members, or more properly what its real membership is. Echenique attempted to downplay the low turnout, claiming that the voting registration system was changed so that only those who had \"regular involvement\" with the party could participate. After the result was announced Podemos number two and Political Secretary Inigo Errej\u00f3n declared, \"The results are clear and the popular mandate will guide the next steps .\" One of the party's co-founders and Secretary of Political and Social Analysis, Carolina Bescansa, warned the PSOE that if it did not \"take the hand we are holding out for a coalition government\" it would have \"many difficulties\" in an election campaign. Podemos mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, called on \"all persons able to reach an agreement\" to enable the formation of a \"government of change\" in order to prevent a new election and end the \"cycle\" of the PP in power. \"One of the things I like best is how in this city municipal government, we are in the minority [but] we achieved agreements,\" Carmena explained, adding that \"My view is moving away from the use of political parties as instruments of representation in representative democracy. I orient more to the establishment of broad fronts...\"--that is, power at any cost. The referendum was a manoeuvre by the Podemos leadership to shield itself from the charge that it was responsible for new elections should they be called and bolster its negotiations with the PSOE. This week, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias called on PSOE leader <mark>Pedro S\u00e1nchez</mark> to ballot his members on Podemos'\" Government of Change \"proposals. Central to the proposals were what Iglesias called 20\" concessions \"to the PSOE that he had made with\" terrible pain \". They represent a wholesale capitulation to the austerity regime demanded by the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank and reveal the fraudulent nature of Podemos' claim to be an anti-austerity party. In reply to those who called the concessions a betrayal of Podemos' principles, a party spokesperson was forced to state with unparalleled cynicism,\" We will continue in our line. Yield, yield and yield. But yielding without betraying the backbone of our national project. \"In the event, Podemos's pleas for a deal were rejected with Iglesias declaring,\" On the part of the PSOE we received an explicit refusal to explore the possibility...They were very clear in telling us their framework is the only possible, as they are firmly tied to Citizens. \"However, PSOE Congress spokesman Antonio Hernando, revealed that of Podemos' 20 proposals the PSOE was happy with 70 percent of them. This statement alone is ample evidence that the political differences between Podemos and the PSOE, a right-wing party that for decades has proven in practice its pro-capitalist, anti-working class credentials, are minimal. A last-minute agreement is entirely possible, as was shown in Greece where last year Podemos' ally Syriza formed a government with the far-right Independent Greeks in order to impose savage austerity measures. Like Syriza, Podemos is a bourgeois party that is hostile to the working class and supports the framework of war and austerity imposed by the European Union. It reflects the interests of upper middle class layers of entrepreneurs, professionals, and academics who will implement whatever is required to get a shot at state power. However, <mark>S\u00e1nchez</mark> is in the grip of a serious dilemma. On the one hand, the PSOE faces the possibility of electoral annihilation should there be any rapprochement with the PP--which was thrown into deeper crisis over the resignation last Friday of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soria from his positions as Congress deputy, Industry Minister and PP regional chairman in the Canary Islands after his name appeared in the Panama Papers. On the other, the majority of the PSOE leadership, led by the president of Andalusia, Susana Diaz, have been vehemently opposed to any alliance with Podemos and would prefer one with the PP. This week acting deputy PP prime minister, Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, warned <mark>S\u00e1nchez</mark> that\" all his left-wing aspirations \"had failed and demanded he drop his opposition to talks with the PP. The PP number three, <mark>Fernando Mart\u00ednez</mark> - Maillo, said,\" We are going to keep until the last day our proposal for a grand coalition. \""}, {"articleID": "2011030315_00052825_W", "names": {"Dan Murphy": ["Q28025982", "Q3013155", "Q5214076", "Q5214077", "Q5214078", "Q5214079"]}, "date": "2011-03-03", "url": "http://retail-week.com/in-business/retail-surgery/with-such-focus-on-customer-service-do-we-need-to-up-our-game/5023081.article?referrer=RSS", "content": "with such focus on customer service do we need to up our game? alixpartners director <mark>dan murphy</mark> is not convinced that consumers expect or demand high-end customer service in all the stores they visit. most consumers who appreciate the value benefits of aldi or primark understand perfectly well the trade-offs between lower prices and customer service levels. everyone understands the easyjet/ryanair price and service model. \"there is far less stigma attached to the value players now,\" he adds. \"a few years ago, their customers were mainly low income families, but now it is common to spot bmws and mercedes in their car parks .\" his view is that it is unrealistic to expect all retailers to deliver some basic minimum standard of individual customer service, as mary portas seems to suggest. while many retailers do talk about putting customers at the heart of their business, in reality they are mostly interested in sales and profits. as customer service levels are very difficult to measure, the most common proxy for these are financial results. as long as primark continues to outperform the sector despite relatively low levels of customer service, why should it change? household disposable income continues to fall and unemployment remains a major issue, particularly among the younger age groups with 20% of 16 - to 24-year-olds out of work. \"retailers must keep this in mind when considering the relationship between higher service levels and prices at the checkout,\" he says. \"i don't see things getting better any time soon, and so inevitably consumers are going to be looking for more ways of saving money, even if this means accepting lower levels of service. retailers just have to be realistic .\" responsible retail latest news on sustainable retail essential retail news and issues, practical insights and strategies to guide you through the business challenges in retailing. hear what the leading names in retail think about the future."}, {"articleID": "2015031017_00075537_W", "names": {"Ian Phillips": ["Q11710887", "Q20683485", "Q21455089", "Q21522952", "Q29643429", "Q56394629", "Q5982597"]}, "date": "2015-03-10", "url": "http://bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/03/10/lost-pet-posters-genre/touMR4vRi6nUb9VmIV95PP/story.html", "content": "The Internet has made most forms of paper communication obsolete, but there's at least one as important as ever: lost-and-found pet notices, which are still most effective tacked to a telephone pole.

The decision was made last Tuesday, after a bilateral videoconference between authorities of the Ecuadorian Agency for Quality Assurance Agro (Agrocalidad) and Peru's National Agrarian Health Service (Senasa). The provincial director of Agrocalidad, Alfredo Icaza, announced the decision to lift the suspension of Phytosanitary Import Permits (PFI) for 10 products from Ecuador and Peru. \"Importers who are already registered in the system can request the respective permits if they meet the phytosanitary import requirements,\" said Icaza. Ecuador decided to suspend the issuance of phytosanitary import permits last April 13 to update phytosanitary requirements; while Peru suspended them on the 27 of the same month. \"This agreement mainly benefits the border areas and will help us control contraband,\" said <mark>Carlos Zambrano</mark>, governor of El Oro. The measure became effective starting Thursday August 11. The authorities will meet again in the city of Tumbes on September 20 to see if they lift the suspension of other products, such as onion and apple in the case of Ecuador, and pineapple and banana in the case of Peru.

and 25-yard completions to tight end jason witten and owens, respectively, on consecutive plays to help dallas drive 80 yards on seven plays in 3:40. and then dallas did a poor job on its kickoff return coverage, and cartwright seized produced a 58-yard kickoff return. five plays later, suisham kicked a 41-yard field goal. \"it was really good,\" zorn said of cartwright's timely return. \"that is our special teams. we just need more of that. we talked during the week about how all three phases needed to be a part of the win, if we were going to win .\" increased fan support, in part, might have aided the redskins in their fast start. after pittsburgh fans seemed to take over fedex--waving gold-and-black terrible towels from start to finish--during the steelers' victory in week 9, players expressed disappointment and frustration about the situation. in fact, steelers fans were so vocal that the redskins had to use a silent count at times because of the crowd noise. presumably in response to that display, radio station espn 980, an outlet washington owner daniel snyder purchased in june, gave away 50,000 \"rally rags\" emblazoned with the redskins' colors and logo. redskins supporters then did their part, waving the towels in an impressive showing before kickoff and at other key moments throughout the game. portis provided the night's first stirring moment, carrying the united states flag as he ran onto the field during pregame introductions. there was a buzz in stadium about two hours before game time as portis, under the supervision of larry hess, director rehabilitation, tested his knee on the field. for about 15 minutes, portis cut sharply, sprinted and ran through others drills in an effort to determine whether he could play. for someone who had not practiced all week because of a sprained medial collateral ligament, portis appeared to move well. after the session, portis, hess, zorn, offensive coordinator <mark>sherman smith</mark>, director of sports medicine bubba tyer and head athletic trainer john burrell met on the field and discussed the situation. portis told the group he could give it a go, and they agreed to let him try. washington quickly benefited from the move as portis played a key role in helping the team take a 7-0 lead. after the cowboys went three and out on the game's opening possession, the redskins traveled 49 yards on 10 plays, the last two yards on campbell's touchdown pass to sellers to the right side. on the drive, portis rushed five times for 29 yards. he gained five yards on his first carry to reach 1,000 yards rushing for the season in his 10th game--the fewest games he has needed to accomplish the feat in his career. with the redskins needing a yard on fourth down at dallas's 11-yard line, portis, who has rushed for at least 1,000 yards six times in his seven-year career, gained nine yards. on the next play, sellers and campbell connected for the touchdown. redskins insider jason la canfora provides exlusive analysis of the redskins."}]
