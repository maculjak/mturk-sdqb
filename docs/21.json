we seem to be moving steadily in the direction of a society where no one is responsible for what he himself did but we are all responsible for what somebody else did, either in the present or in the past. why let discussions with visiting celebrities be a constant distraction during a televised tennis match or baseball game? if we each sat down and wrote out all the mistakes we have made in our lives, all the paper needed would require cutting down whole forests. much discussion of the interrogation of captured terrorists ignores the inescapable reality of trade-offs. the real question is: how many american lives are you prepared to sacrifice, in order to spare a terrorist from experiencing distress? governments should govern, not micro-manage the economy. a government unrealistic enough to think it can micro-manage is likely to do a worse job than most. inspiring as it is to study the history of the struggles and sacrifices that created and preserved america, it is also painful to see how all those investments of efforts and lives are being frittered away today for short-sighted and self-centered reasons."}, {"articleID": "2011110317_00069310_W", "names": {"Paul Carter": ["Q15434260", "Q15458398", "Q16230104", "Q22003572", "Q29785709", "Q47400077", "Q53186219", "Q58262322", "Q7149747"]}, "date": "2011-11-03", "url": "http://bbc.co.uk/go/rss/int/news/-/news/uk-england-15581756", "content": "schools in the south east have been given a boost with more than?

Saturday, July 20 marks one year since the Aurora movie theater shooting rampage, which left 12 dead and 70 wounded. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) AURORA, Colo. - Survivors of mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut gathered with dozens of supporters Friday in a suburban Denver park to honour those killed in the massacre at an Aurora movie theatre almost a year to the day after the attack. Vigil participants read a list of names of those killed in recent gun violence around the nation and talked about the pain of losing loved ones as they called for strict federal gun control laws.\" Why wait any longer? \"asked Carlee Soto, whose sister was killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School rampage in Newtown, Conn.\" The time for change is now. \"Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which promotes tough gun laws and was founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, helped sponsor the vigil. The scene was sombre, even as about 100 gun rights activists held a protest nearby to oppose new firearms restrictions as infringements on Second Amendment rights. Many wore orange National Rifle Association hats and T-shirts reading,\" I will not comply. \"\"To the families and victims of the tragedy, we offer our condolences and prayers,\" said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. \"To Mayor Bloomberg and the group that would politicize this, we offer our opposition.\" Brown helped organize the rally and carried a .45 - calibre pistol to the park. The shooting victims, meanwhile, called for more universal background checks and tighter restrictions on gun sales. Colorado has been the only state outside the East Coast to ratchet back gun rights in reaction to last year's mass shootings. A recent push for new federal restrictions failed in Congress. \"I think that Coloradans get it, that something must change,\" said <mark>Tom Sullivan</mark>, whose son Alex was killed in the theatre. Just before their rally started, one gun rights activist, Rob Blancken, tried to stand behind a lectern with a sign that read, \"Tell billionaire Mayor Bloomberg to stay the hell out of Colorado.\" He was told to move by a state parks ranger. Gun rights organizers said they sympathized with the victims but didn't see new gun control laws as a solution. \"We want the families of the victims to know that we are sorry for their loss,\" said Alicia Perez, a Colorado organizer with Gun Rights Across America. For his part, Stephen Barton, who was wounded in Aurora, said, \"You shouldn't wait until it affects you to start caring about it.\" \"I never thought I would ever be affected by gun violence personally,\" Barton added. Mayors Against Illegal Guns said participants were reading the names of about 2,500 people who have been killed by gunfire since Dec. 14, when a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook. The Aurora vigil came almost a year to the day after 12 people were killed and 70 others were wounded, some paralyzed, in a July 20 attack at a midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" The victims' names were being read until 12:38 a.m. Saturday, the moment that the shootings began in the theatre last year. The theatre planned no midnight showings on July 20 this year. At least eight uniformed police officers were at the theatre complex Friday, including one inside the auditorium where the shootings took place. Dallas Hill of Aurora, who was among about 30 people who watched \"Red 2? in that theatre Friday night, said he had no qualms about being there.\" We've been in there several times before, \"he said.\" The first couple times (after the shooting) it was a little eerie, \"he said. Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, accompanied by more than 20 white-robed priests, led a memorial Mass for the theatre victims Friday night at St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in Aurora.\" Sin, violence and evil does not have the final word, \"he said in his homily. Names of those killed alternated on video screens outside the sanctuary. Remembrance events planned for Saturday included an early morning memorial service and a host of volunteer civic works, music, arts and even meditation. Aurora officials say they wanted to promote healing. ___ Associated Press writer Thomas Peipert contributed to this report."}, {"articleID": "2014021409_00013986_W", "names": {"Adam Lambert": ["Q190231", "Q30310741"]}, "date": "2014-02-14", "url": "http://www.wsoctv.com/feed/entertainment/american-idol-welcomes-its-first-openly-gay/fX3R3/", "content": "Posted: 7:45 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 13, 2014 RumorFix.com Of course there have always been gay contestants on American Idol.

Principal Kathy Dalton, who has led the school for 21 years, couldn't hide her happiness yesterday as pupils, politicians and parents filed in. \"It's a great school, we're very lucky. Not everyone gets the chance to build a new school,\" she said. \"It's a once in a lifetime thing.\" Even though pupils moved into the newest building last year, the final touches were only added on Tuesday. The principal pointed to two new classrooms, freshly carpeted with blank walls - yet to be wallpapered with student art and posters. \"They were finished just last night. Grade five and six will move into those classrooms in the coming weeks,\" Ms Dalton said. \"We purchased the land in 2007 and the building began in 2008 and we moved into the first stage in 2011.\" The building has been something that we've been doing on a journey. \"The long-serving principal may need to take up gardening with the major project behind her.

That's deep enough. Bellinger, Max Muncy and <mark>Russell Martin</mark> homered as the Dodgers kept up their longball barrage, beating Colorado 10-6 on Friday in the Rockies' home opener. After hitting a franchise-record 235 home runs last year, the NL champion Dodgers have connected a whopping 21 times in only eight games this season. They've homered in every game so far. What's more, the 21 homers through their opening eight games are the second-most in major league history behind the St. Louis Cardinals, who had 23 in 2000. \"We have a talented lineup,\" Muncy said. \"We're very deep. On top of that, we're all up there and having fun.\" Bellinger hit his sixth of the year, breaking the game open with a three-run drive in the fifth. To think, he didn't hit his sixth homer last season until game No. 41. \"I'm just feeling good and trying to keep it going,\" Bellinger said. Muncy finished a double shy of a cycle, walking in the ninth. He can't remember the last time he ever accomplished the feat. \"That would've been pretty cool,\" Muncy said. Trevor Story homered twice for the Rockies. Kenta Maeda (2-0) threw five efficient innings and cruised through a scuffling Colorado lineup. He allowed four hits and his only run on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly. Maeda's biggest pitch was a slider in the fifth that Trevor Story took for a called third strike with two outs and the bases loaded. The Rockies were 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position against Maeda. His secret was simple: \"Have a strong heart,\" Maeda said through a translator. A slow-working Tyler Anderson (0-2) couldn't find his groove in allowing six runs over four innings. Both homers he surrendered were on fastballs. The left-hander is coming off a season in which he gave up 30 homers, tied for the most in the NL. \"They have some guys that are really hot and they stayed hot,\" Anderson said. \"I think really the one that turns it from a day that you're grinding through into a bad day is that Bellinger homer. That was a pretty good pitch that usually in the past he hasn't gotten to that pitch. But he's pretty locked in right now.\" Bellinger's drive off Anderson gave him 16 RBIs. In contrast, the Rockies have 22 RBIs as a team. This was the first of 19 games between two teams that needed a tiebreaker last season to decide the NL West crown before the Dodgers prevailed. It's a burgeoning rivalry in the eyes of the Rockies, but not so much to Los Angeles. \"They're a good club that I have a lot of respect for,\" Dodgers manager <mark>Dave Roberts</mark> said. \"But geography plays into a rivalry.\" TRAINER'S ROOM Dodgers: LHP <mark>Rich Hill</mark> (strained left knee) will throw a 20-pitch bullpen session Saturday ....<mark>Roberts</mark> said he was leaning toward LHP Clayton Kershaw (shoulder inflammation) making another rehab start at Triple-A Oklahoma City. Kershaw gave up two runs and struck out six over 4 1/3 innings in a rehab stint Thursday. <mark>KELLY</mark> UPDATE In the ninth, righty <mark>Joe Kelly</mark> came out of the game after being hit by a comebacker that deflected off his glove and caught him in the right wrist. The X-rays on the wrist were negative. \"He'll pick up a baseball tomorrow and see how it feels,\" <mark>Roberts</mark> said. HOME OPENER The Rockies have now dropped three of their last four home openers. The announced attendance was 48,404. \"(The fans) brought it today and we really didn't,\" Story said.

(File) A Valsad district court on Saturday rejected a police plea seeking the remand of Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani for three days, and instead ordered him to remain present before the investigating officer of Valsad police between 10 am to 5 pm on any day for questioning in the fake video case. Advertising Valsad town police had registered a defamation case against Mevani after he uploaded on his Twitter account a video of a teacher beating a student and attributed it wrongly to RMVM school in Valsad. The independent MLA had also had tagged the prime minister's office in the tweet, seeking action. Mevani later deleted the tweet after coming to know that the video was of some other place and not of RMVM school Valsad. He had also posted a clarification regarding the tweet. Mevani had earlier been granted bail by the Gujarat High Court, which directed him to present himself to Valsad police when called. On August 2, Mevani presented himself for questioning. Police officials first arrested him and later released him as he had anticipatory bail. They later told him to appear in the Valsad district court on Saturday, as they would be seeking his remand. Advertising On Saturday afternoon, Valsad police submitted the application to the court of Judge Hina Desai, seeking three days' police remand. The police said they wanted Mevani's mobile phone for investigation. On August 2, Mevani had refused to hand in his phone, saying there was sensitive communication on it between him and political leaders and other important people. Mevani was present in court with his lawyer advocate Ayaz Shaikh and advocate <mark>Rahul Sharma</mark>. After the arguments from both prosecution and defence, the court rejected the police's plea for remand and ordered instead that Mevani be present before the investigating officer of Valsad police when called. Advocate Shaikh said, \"The judge granted our arguments that it (remanding Mevani) would be a breach of personal liberty of my client. We also explained to the court that police cannot pressure us to hand in the mobile phone, as it would be used against us as evidence. The court had agreed to our arguments and rejected the police remand application.\" "}]
