request by the owners of the daily news and inquirer for permission to hire a law firm to investigate the unauthorized taping of a november meeting between the company and its creditors. but judge jean fitzsimon yesterday asked a committee of unsecured creditors to look into the incident, in which philadelphia newspapers ceo <mark>brian tierney</mark> discovered that vincent devito, an executive of the new york investment firm cit group, was recording the meeting. cit is among the senior lenders who hold the company's secured debt. it's the unsecured-creditors group that can now investigate the incident. according to participants at the november meeting, devito apologized and stopped taping after <mark>tierney</mark> told him that taping without permission is illegal in pennsylvania. <mark>tierney</mark> has since pressed for a further inquiry to determine if other meetings were taped and if confidential information might have been shared with others. \"we're very pleased that the judge agreed with us that this is a very serious matter that needs investigation,\" <mark>tierney</mark> said after a hearing yesterday in which he testified about the meeting. <mark>tierney</mark> said that after he made an issue of the taping in november, negotiations with the company's creditors took a sharp turn for the worse, and led to his decision to file for bankruptcy protection in february. creditors opposed <mark>tierney</mark>'s proposal to use company money to hire the law firm of elliott greenleaf & siedzikowski to investigate, and were pleased that fitzsimon denied the request. fitzsimon said that she wanted the company and its creditors to stay focused on resolving their financial issues, and said that the taping controversy could be \"one of the sideshows\" that distract attention from that effort. because your contributions are currently under review, no comments can be made at this time. philly.com comments are intended to be civil,

diary of her activities, including the time she spent with the author. it's a monday afternoon in november, and i'm driving down ventura boulevard with jill price, the woman who can't forget. price, who is 43, has spent most of her life here in los angeles, and she remembers everything. in the space of two minutes, she tells me about the former motel lodge with a bear in front, the courtyard hotel that used to be a hilton, and a bowling alley-since replaced by a marshalls-where a nicolas cage film was shot. all this comes pouring out so fast, i wonder aloud whether price has had too much coffee. she laughs, says no, pulls slightly at her blond hair, and starts up again. right over there, she says, is a car wash: \"i was talking to the guy there last summer, and i was telling him about the first time i ever went to the car wash-on august 30, 1978. and he was freaking out .\" soon, price, generally a gentle soul, has moved on to a rant about a tv program she just saw: \"it was about an event that happened in 2002. so they kept going back to saturday, june 19, 2002. well, june 19, 2002, was not a saturday! it was a wednesday. it was pissing me off .\" a youtube clip of her on 20/20. diane sawyer asks price, an avid television viewer, to identify certain significant dates in broadcast history. when did cbs air the \"who shot jr?\" episode of dallas? when was all in the family's baby episode shown? and so on. price nails every question. she not only gives the date for the final episode of mash but describes the weather that day. the most remarkable moment comes when sawyer asks price when princess grace died. she immediately answers, \"september 14, 1982-that was the first day i started 12th grade .\" for once, it seems that the memory lady has blown it. sawyer laughs nervously and tries gently to right her guest: \"september 10, 1982 .\" price misunderstands, thinking she's being prompted to identify another event-the possibility that she's being corrected apparently doesn't occur to her. no, sawyer says, she has made a mistake; according to the book that 20/20's producers were using as a source, princess grace died on september 10. price stands her ground, and not 60 seconds later, a producer breaks in: \"the book is wrong .\" price is right after all! until recently, no one had ever heard of jill price. her friends and family knew her memory was remarkable, but nobody in the scientific community did. her road to stardom started in june 2000 (monday, june 5, to be exact), when she stumbled upon a web page for james mcgaugh, a uc irvine neuroscientist who specializes in learning and memory, and decided to send him an email describing her unusual ability to recall the past. mcgaugh wrote back 90 minutes later. he tells me he was skeptical at first, but it didn't take long for him to become convinced that price was something special; he soon introduced her to two of his collaborators, larry cahill and elizabeth parker. the three researchers interviewed price many times over the next five years, but they kept the story to themselves. finally, mcgaugh and company were ready to share what they had found. in february 2006, their article, \"a case of unusual autobiographical remembering,\" appeared in the journal neurocase. shortly thereafter, the uc irvine press office peddled the story to the orange county register - and price's world was turned upside down. the newspaper article, which identified her only as \"aj,\" appeared on march 13, 2006. within hours, uc irvine was besieged with inquiries. four weeks later, the story went national: price was interviewed on npr's morning edition (still under the aj pseudonym). an editor at free press eventually tracked her down, and a book deal followed; price would tell her own story, this time under her own name. the media played along, withholding further news on the woman who couldn't forget until the book's release. since then, price has been on a nonstop media junket. diane sawyer actually had her on twice in one day (on good morning america and 20/20). by the time i met price, she had been interviewed by oprah and had been featured in every major newspaper from the wall street journal. often the pieces focused on the pain she felt because of her inability to forget difficult moments. as i followed price's story, i was fascinated but doubtful. i am a cognitive psychologist, and to me something didn't smell right. everyone seems to have an uncle or cousin with \"photographic\" memory, but damned if they can actually give you a phone number to reach that person. the only serious scientific paper documenting photographic memory was published nearly 40 years ago, and that study has never been replicated. price, however, is eminently real. i spent the better part of two days with her, meeting her friends and family and watching her at the office. at the end, i can honestly say that in my decade as a professor of psychology, i've never encountered anyone remotely like jill price. ordinary human memory is a mess. most of us can recall the major events in our lives, but the memory of homo sapiens pales when compared with your average laptop. it takes us far longer to store data (you might have to hear a phone number five to 10 times before you can repeat it); it's easy for us to forget things we've learned (try reciting anything from your sophomore history class); and it's sometimes hard to dislodge outdated information (st. petersburg will always remain leningrad to me). worse, our memories are vulnerable to contamination and distortion. lawyers can readily fool us with suggestive questions; false memories can easily be implanted. the fundamental problem is the seemingly haphazard fashion in which our memories are organized. on a computer, every single bit of information is stored at a specific location, from which it can always be retrieved. human recall is hit or miss. neuroscientific research tells us that our brains don't use a fixed-address system, and memories tend to overlap, combine, and disappear for reasons no one yet understands. the one thing we do know is rather vague: memories live in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. after that, the entire question of how memory works is up for grabs. for example, where precisely in the hippocampus (or prefrontal cortex) is my memory of reading kurt vonnegut for the first time? if i try to summon that experience, i am likely to wind up with a blur-a half dozen indistinct recollections. and no brain-scan technology will help me bring it into better focus. so when i hear about price's feats, my mind boggles. from the perspective of evolution, finding a human being with memory that works with the precision of a computer would be like finding someone with bones made of steel. the type of memory system we have-in technical terms, context-dependent rather than location-addressable-has been around for several hundred million years. the existence of a human brain that works completely differently is astronomically unlikely. yet here i am, and here is price. the three uc irvine scientists who studied her decided that her case deserved its own name - hyperthymestic syndrome, academic greek for \"exceptional memory\" - and it's not hard to see why. i come prepared with a stack of questionnaires, and when we return to her house, price is kind enough to let me administer my tests, easily blowing through the first few. i ask, for example, if she can tell me some dates of famous accidents and airline crashes; she's all but unstoppable. she instantly retrieves from memory the exact dates of the explosions of space shuttle challenger and pan am flight 103 over lockerbie, scotland. she remembers not just that september 25, 1978, was when a psa flight crashed in san diego but also that the jet collided with a cessna. she can go in either direction, disaster to date or date to disaster. when i say \"january 13, 1982,\" price has no trouble recalling the air florida flight that according to mcgaugh's neurocase article, price is even more astounding on the events of her own life. at the scientists' behest, for example, she recalled-without warning and in just 10 minutes-what she'd done on every easter since 1980. \"april 6, 1980: 9th grade, easter vacation ends. april 19, 1981: 10th grade, new boyfriend, h. april 11, 1982: 11th grade, grandparents visiting for passover...\"soon, though, the limitations of her memory begin to show. my next questionnaire is on the just-concluded 2008 presidential election, and here things go less well. she is off by a few days on hillary clinton's withdrawal from the race and clueless on the iowa caucuses. price nails both the republican convention and the st. louis vice presidential debate (she was at a regular thursday dinner that night) but can't say the precise date when obama clinched the nomination. when it comes to the 2004 election, she opts out entirely. i soon find that except for her own personal history and certain categories like television and airplane crashes, price's memory isn't much better than anyone else's. she struggled in school, is no good at history before 1965, and seems genuinely miffed that she was once asked when the magna carta was signed (\"do i look like i'm 500 years old?\" ). for a scientist like me, the real test is to see how well price can remember something new. i am especially interested in memory distortions. if you read an average person a list of words like cloth, and knitting, and then ask them to repeat the words, they'll likely imagine they've heard needle even though it's not on the list. can price sail past the trap of memory distortion? no, she can't. i read her five lists of words drawn from a psychological test known as the drm, and not only does she miss a number of words, she also recalls hearing three i didn't say. her performance may be a little above average, but no more than that. if price's memory of her own history is so precise, why is it so average for everything else? or, more to the point, if her memory for everything else is so ordinary, why is her memory of her own history so extraordinary? the answer has nothing to do with memory and everything to do with personality. price remembers so much about herself because she thinks about herself-and her past-almost constantly. she still has every stuffed animal she's ever gotten, enough (as she showed me in a photograph) to completely cover the surface of her childhood bed. she has 2,000 videotapes and countless audiotapes, not to mention more than 50,000 pages of diary entries in idiosyncratic handwriting-so dense that it's almost unreadable. until recently she owned a copy of every tv guide since summer 1989. i'm not sure price wants to catalog her life like this, but she can't help herself. when she tells me that one of her biggest regrets in life is that no one followed her around with a microphone during her childhood, i'm not the least bit surprised. in her own words, she lives as if there's a split screen running in her mind-one half on the present, the other on the past. the onset of price's exceptional recall seems to be closely tied to a painful event: her family's move from south orange, new jersey, to los angeles on june 29, 1974. for price, life can be neatly divided into periods before and after that childhood trauma, and her detailed memories begin just after the move. even as an adult, price continues to be haunted by separation anxiety. she has lived with her parents her entire life, and her anxiety about moving recurred in 2003, at age 37, when her parents decided to take a smaller house. just as price hadn't wanted to leave south orange as a child, she dreaded leaving the only home she'd known since she was 8. packing her memorabilia for storage took more than a month. perhaps the hardest part was the thought that she'd have to leave behind a piece of wallpaper on which she'd recorded minor personal details for nearly 30 years. in the end, and much to the consternation of the family's realtor, price took a razor blade to the wall and peeled off one more cherished souvenir. in the time i spend with her, i notice that the not-particularly-foulmouthed price is very fond of the expression that so-and-so \"shits and farts just like the rest of us\" - as in \"joe movie star might make a lot of money, but he still shits and farts like anyone else .\" by the third time i hear her utter this phrase, i can't help but notice its relevance to her own life: price may display unusually complete recall of her own past, but her memory is the same blurry patchwork as everyone else's. the difference is that she scans her past relentlessly. every time we think about something, and especially how it connects to something else, we get better at remembering it-a phenomenon that psychologists call elaborative encoding. price has spent her whole life ruminating on the past, constructing timelines and lists, and contemplating the connections between one february 19 and the next. dates and memories are her constant companions, and as a result she's really good at remembering her past. end of story. why were price's abilities blown so far out of proportion? i wouldn't blame price; she's as happy to tell what she doesn't remember as what she does. but her story has taken on a life of its own. it started with that 2006 journal article: although the scientists knew about price's diaries and compulsions, little in the paper speaks to the question of whether it might be personality, not memory, that makes her extraordinary. then there was the editor at free press who gave price's book the manifestly false title the extraordinary story of living with the most remarkable memory known to science. and don't forget the credulous media that ate up the story-without, apparently, ever seeking a second opinion from scientists not involved in the case. lost in all the hype is an inconvenient fact: price's brain was scanned more than two years ago, and the results-not yet published-apparently don't support the notion that she's some kind of memory goddess. her hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are reportedly normal. the one significant aberration, according to price-who was told about the scans by doctors who won't discuss them publicly-is that her brain resembles those of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. the true nature of price's memory becomes clear to me by the end of our first day of interviews, but i don't know whether to tell her. i try to keep my thoughts to myself when i meet her on day two in her office, where she works as a hyperkinetic, hyperorganized school administrator. but she wants to know what i'm going to write. i panic-worrying that her feelings will be hurt-and wonder how i'm going to explain. while i'm stalling, she tells me about an article on memory published that morning in the wall street journal; she's mentioned and wants to know what i think. she prints it out for me, and i skim through it. mcgaugh, the lead author of the original neurocase article, is quoted-talking, of all things, about elaborative encoding. i start slowly-griping about the newspaper article, which i find to be a bit sloppy scientifically; i scarcely mention price or what the author has to say about her. but eventually i come to the main point and read aloud from the critical paragraph: \"what if you want to remember more about each passing day? one simple method is to keep a journal. writing down a few thoughts and events every day not only makes a tangible record, it also requires you to reflect .\" isn't that price to a t? doesn't it explain why her forte is autobiographical memory rather than, say, recalling dates in ancient history? i think the answers are obviously yes, and i tell her so. \"but i didn't search this out,\" she protests, denying that her obsessions have anything to do with her memory. no, but that doesn't matter, i say. i explain how her rumination on the past isn't something she does voluntarily, but whenever she does it, the connections between her memories are strengthened. price is quiet for a moment, thinking about what i've said. \"this is ocd,\" she says softly. \"i have ocd of my memories .\" three similar hyperthymestics have come forward since the 2006 journal article, each with spectacular autobiographical memory, and all three have similar ocd-like habits. they all collect things and are

[id: nn25309260] \"in terms of china, there's substantial currency and debt risk with the current holdings of reserves, so this reflects an ongoing pattern of diversification that we've seen across both public and private sector institutional funds,\" said daniel wills, senior analyst at etf securities in london. gold prices rose a modest 1 percent after the news on friday, but few dealers expect beijing to abandon its discreet approach and embark on a buying spree. china in six years, etf in six months the announcement that beijing was sitting on 1,054 tonnes of gold bullion, up 75 percent in the past six years, pushed china up to the fifth place in the table of gold-holding nations. for a graphic showing the world's biggest gold holders: in some regards, the sum is sizeable, about the same amount that europe's central banks and the international monetary fund sell each year as they gradually and publicly destock. by other measures the sum is paltry. the spdr gold trust, the biggest exchange traded fund, saw its holdings rise by the same sum over just six months. by reuters calculation, china's holdings of gold are worth around $30.9 billion at current prices, while the u.s. gold mountain is valued at $238 billion. the united states holds 79 percent of its foreign currency reserves in gold. \"we recommend our clients hold 5 percent of their investments in gold. on that basis china has another 3,300 tonnes to buy,\" says anz's senior commodities analyst mark pervan. and buying more gold would fit well with beijing's publicly stated aim to build a bigger inventory of all raw materials, which would also reduce its exposure to the greenback. \"i see this as very supportive for sentiment towards gold--i suspect that the chinese will seek further opportunities to rebalance their gold holdings, in line with other central banks,\" said <mark>nick moore</mark>, global head of commodity strategy at rbs global banking and markets in london.", "articleID": "2009042702_00013028_W", "names": {"Nick Moore": ["Q3876026", "Q7027567", "Q7027569"]}}, {"date": "2009-04-28", "url": "http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/animal_world/", "content": "leiter reports philosophy, politics, current events, academia <mark>manoj joshi</mark>'s blog archival site of an indian journalist the huffington post politics, current events pharyngula science, politics, education, society amardeep singh literature, culture, south asian affairs abstract nonsense political, social and mathematical thoughts and commentary majikthise lindsay beyerstein: political and social commentary lester hunt philosophy, nature, social commentary legal history blog scholarship, news and new ideas in legal history trackback (0) december 23, 2008 season's greetings to our readers and my co-bloggers. hope everyone returns to a.b. refreshed and cheered after the holiday festivities are over and done with for the year. i am going on a short trip and won't be blogging for some time. unless someone else finds the time to post, the front page will remain static for a few days. i will leave you with a potpourri of unrelated but interesting links to muse over if you find time to visit during the holiday rush. trackback (0) september 08, 2008 taking a bit of a break from the faintly sinister and patently ludicrous political theater surrounding the us presidential campaign, i am happy to bring you news of a different kind. stories that lift our spirits very often describe the triumph of the utterly vulnerable - the miserable underdog beating incredible odds. in this particular case, the underdogs happen to be real dogs and this is the heartwarming story of their rescue from debauched cruelty and certain death. little over a year ago, we learnt about the criminal activities of ex-nfl star who was caught and later sentenced to jail for the brutal torture of several pit bulls that he used in illegal dog fighting. vick is currently in jail serving a sentence of 23 months (too lenient, in my opinion). but what about the abused dogs, some of whom were bred to be vicious killers and others as terrified bait animals? at the time of the court case, the conventional wisdom (including that of various animal welfare organizations) was that the dogs had been so severely abused that they were beyond rehabilitation and needed to be euthanized. but an animal rescue agency in utah thought otherwise. volunteers from best friends pleaded with the court for a chance to return vick's dogs to normalcy through patient and humane care. luckily for the dogs, the judge agreed to give the animals a second chance after the hell hole to which vick and his cronies had condemned them from puppyhood. the tragic story now has a happy ending. read about the loving rehabilitation and amazing transformation of the dogs on the: (i have added best friends to the list of animal charities i plan to support regularly) national geographic filmed the progress of the vicious, suspicious or coweringly nervous dogs to trusting, playful animals some of whom have already been adopted by dog lovers. the documentary aired on september 5 on the ng channel in their series dog town.

been their imprisonment that rehabilitation seemed impossible. others, including the veterinarians and trainers at utah's best friends animal society, argued that the dogs could be saved. a judge finally agreed, and more than half were turned over to various shelters and rescues; the 22 most troubled dogs were sent to dogtown. located on 3,000 acres of canyon country in southern utah, the best

although the tabloid-style argument over the family shenanigans of the palins has brought mccain's vp pick into sharp focus, there's another side to the much-vaunted abilities of gov. palin that you may not know of yet. this is who mccain has nominated for vp: \"on march 27, the state house passed house bill 256, gov. sarah palin's bill, which allows for no science-based, same-day airborne hunting of wolves and bears and opens the doors to game-farming in alaska. it also allows the lieutenant governor to remove alaska's ballot measure to vote again on aerial hunting, thus taking alaskans' right to vote away .\" this is what airborne hunting of wolves looks like: one of the saddest things i've seen, akin to the cow mistreatment videos that we as the companion of a geriatric cat, i am acutely conscious of the changes in nutritional, psychological and medical care that must be afforded to aging animals. with advancements in veterinary science and safer environments, just as domestic pets in affluent nations are experiencing unprecedented increase in their longevity, so are the inmates of modern, better designed zoos. as a result, zoo animals sometimes survive much longer than they might in their natural habitats. offer up new challenges to their care takers who must learn to adapt to the changing and sometimes unexpected needs of their aging wards. even as a youngster, rollie looked older and wiser than his years. his white mustache sprouted longer by the month, until it flamed from his cheeks like a german kaiser's. in the past few years, though, the tribulations of age - not just the appearance of it - have begun catching up with rollie. his keepers are reminded each time they get a look past the emperor tamarin's flowing whiskers and into his jaws. the monkey, used to crunching on raw sweet potato, has surrendered all but six of his 32 teeth to the toll of time. at 17, rollie - a resident of chicago's lincoln park zoo - is a senior citizen of his species. in the amazon he almost certainly would never have made it this long. in captivity, he's got plenty of company. the golden years have arrived at the nation's zoos and aquariums, taking veterinarians and keepers, along with their animals, into a zone of unknowns. do female gorillas, living in to their 40s and 50s, experience menopause? how do you weigh the most difficult choice - between prolonging pain and ending life - when the patient is a venerable jaguar who feels like a member of the family? all those questions hang on a larger one that, until recent years, has been left to educated guesswork. \"how old do animals really live?\" says sharon dewar, a spokeswoman for the lincoln park zoo, whose keepers adjusted to rollie's toothlessness by serving him soft-cooked veggies. \"that's the million-dollar question .\" about a japanese train company which turned its fortune around by appointing a cat as the station master, my co-blogger dean informed me that us

do with a jury-rigged system when they need to urinate. while one of the crew was using the russian-made toilet last week, the toilet motor fan stopped working, according to nasa. since then, the liquid waste gathering part of the toilet has been working on-and-off. fortunately, the solid waste collecting part is functioning normally. russian officials don't know the cause of the problem, and the crew has been unable to fix it. the crew has used the toilet on the soyuz return capsule, but it has a limited capacity. they now are using a backup bag-like collection system that can be connected to the broken toilet, according to nasa public affairs officials. \"like any home anywhere, the importance of having a working bathroom is obvious,\" nasa spokesman allard beutel said. a

proclivities. the two that caught my eye particularly are: 3. languages known: english (best of all), tamil (really well, but unfortunately i never did learn any swear words in it, even though it's my mother tongue), hindi (enough to sing along with bollywood songs and understand the dialog), malayalam (enough to pass for a tamilian speaking malayalam badly), sanskrit (enough to be dangerous trying to figure out when the priest at the local temple has bumbled in his rendition), french (parisien accent, rolled \"rr's and all ...) plus, i can read cyrillic and urdu scripts, though i am rather rusty with the lack of practice. i'm aiming to learn telugu, bengali, arabic and chinese as well, if i can get hold of enough online material. 8. i love creepy-crawlies and spend an inordinate amount of time trying to save spiders, centipedes and the like from the attacks of the\" bug squad' (m & s armed with fly-swatters and bug vacuums). i knew that sujatha knows several languages well. but that she can read cyrillic and urdu scripts came as a complete surprise to me and i am properly impressed. the second revelation impressed me even more - her love for creepy-crawlies and the time she spends trying to save them. i am wondering if sujatha ever goes as far as by a mad poet - all of them apt! my favorites: 19. for having consider'd god and himself he will consider his neighbour. 42.

mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat, below st. louis. in 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one - and two - story frame dwellings, whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning glories. each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots, prince's - feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. when there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. recall of 143 million pounds of beef, one of the largest in u.s. history was made recently, affecting thousands of school districts supplied by a california plant under the national school lunch program. this stemmed from an undercover investigation of practices at the plant, complete with a disturbing video shot of animals being forced into the chutes, even when they were sick and unable to walk in. wrangler isn't an ordinary slaughterhouse worker. he is an undercover investigator for the humane society of the united states, who got a job at the westland plant and filmed the abuses with a hidden camera. \"there wasn't a formal strategy or anything like that,\" he says. \"you're there just doing the job, and this stuff is just happening all around you .\" on jan. 30, the humane society broadcast excerpts of the video on its web site. the next day, the united stated department of agriculture suspended westland meat co. as a supplier to the national school lunch program. a few days later, usda pulled its inspectors from the plant and shut down the plant, pending further investigation. the acts of animal cruelty have led to the arrest of two meatpacking workers by chino police. more than two weeks after wrangler's video caused a sensation online, the usda issued the largest beef recall in the history of the united states: 143 million pounds of beef products, most of which has already been consumed. about 40 percent of that meat went to the national school lunch program and other federal nutrition programs. amazingly, all of the abuses occurred with usda inspectors on the premises. secretary of agriculture ed schafer said he was \"dismayed at the inhumane handling of cattle\" at the plant. the school district my children attend was among the many listed as having received the recalled meat cases, and while the authorities assure us that the recalled meat has been off the lunch menus since the start of february, there are still anecdotes of some kid or the other having stomach problems after eating meat at lunch. who knows whether the un-recalled products are any safer or more humanely harvested than the recalled batch? we will probably never find out. temple grandin, who is autistic, brought fascinating insights into the behavior of animals, as \"autistic savants' of sorts. she is also an industry expert on the design of humane slaughter house facilities, and is even invoked in a feb 3, 2008 westland letter promising more investigation into the cattle abuse: during 2007, we had 17 third party audits of our operation to confirm that we meet the statutorily mandated humane handling and food safety standards. in addition we have conducted 12 internal audits by our own personnel to ensure that such standards are met. we also, conduct weekly humane handling audits based on standards set forth in the american meat institute's (ami), recommended animal handling guidelines and audit guide 2007 edition, which was authored by dr. temple grandin, a world renowned expert of humane handling practices. complete documentation of this activity has been made available to the usda investigation team currently at our plant. what problems have been rectified by the recall of meat that have been largely consumed by now? will it really save unwary consumers from eating problem meat? it seems more like a case of bolting the stables after the horses have run away, similar to the above is an

lamp is not on. one hears footsteps on the stairs, debate in south carolina had more than its share of fireworks. senators hillary clinton and barack obama went at each other with passion and fury. the bitter exchange continued beyond the debate stage when both candidates addressed reporters to harp on the weaknesses and dirty tactics of their main rival. yesterday morning sujatha and i had a short e-mail exchange about a new york times article on politics in the hillary) challenging the newcomer (obama) to the group, while edwards was like a side-lined silverback, trying to recapture the attention of the audience in between the slugfest between obama and clinton. we're not that far off from our proto-monkey ancestors!\" i agree. but both of us forgot the other when the memory of a beloved and very loving pet's death was painfully fresh in my mind. the article was linked to a newsweek essay by jonathan cooperman who had just gone through the wrenching experience of putting his playful doberman to sleep. i argued that those of us who love our animal companions deeply, relate to them at some level as persons. in doing so, we unashamedly accord them the dignity and worth that we normally reserve for our human family members. while some find the notion bewildering and even preposterous, others like me, find nothing unusual about the sentiment. 3 quarks daily, recently went through the ordeal of dealing with the near fatal sickness of his much loved cat, freddy. he was distraught and disconsolate and was surprised by the depth of his own sorrow. in a heartfelt article, abbas examines his emotions and his deep attachment to his feline companion. he concludes that freddy had long ago ceased being a \"cat\" in his mind and had been transformed into a very interesting and endearing \"person\" whose company is now an essential source of joy for him. there are two kinds of people: there are the kooky kind who will spend $4,000 on dialysis for their cat whose kidneys are failing (substitute some significant expenditure of resources for individuals in differing financial circumstances - you know what i mean), even if only to extend its life briefly; and then there are the kind who will make fun of the former (or even regard them with moral disapproval - that money could have been used for better purposes, etcetera). recent events surprised me by showing that i belong in the first category. and now that i know i belong there, i am going to attempt an explanation or at least hazard a conjecture, a speculation, a plain guess, at what puts some people there. i have thought a bit about my own reactions which, as i mentioned above, surprised and even embarrassed me ....here's what i think: while you can have various degrees of affection for pets, there is a quantum leap that you can make (and this is a rubicon that cannot be uncrossed): if in your own psychological representation of your pet, you habitually grant them personhood, then there is no choice but to treat them as you would a person because different parts of your mind which specialize in generating the emotions which allow you to interact with (and love) other humans come into play, and these are irresistible impulses. you might as well try to not care about your children. i believe that some animals, like cats and dogs, have through their long histories of living in people's homes as pets (more than 10,000 years in the case of cats), been naturally selected to encourage human empathy. imagine what a survival advantage it is to the household cat that its young behave in such ways and make such tiny, vulnerable (to the human ear) sounds that it takes a particularly monstrous human to harm a kitten. similarly, they have, i think \"learned\" (even if they do not have the equivalent emotion--after all, just as i don't know two animal posts in a row - no it's not going to be a pattern. having written a story yesterday about cruelty to animals, i hope to cheer things up a bit with a heart warming and curious tale of peaceful animal-human co-existence. \"books. cats. life is sweet .\" the following story may well inspire t-shirts and other parphernelia with the logo, \"family. friends. purring cat. death is peaceful .\" ..... in a nursing home for the elderly in providence, rhode island, lives oscar, a two year old cat adopted by the staff who literally \"sniffs\" out death. oscar unerringly picks out patients who are about to die - very soon. he gets in the bed with them and waits until they are gone - purring all the while. his record is so impressive that doctors and the medical staff at the steere house nursing and rehabilitation center have begun to depend on oscar to alert them to the impending deaths of patients, so they can notify family and loved ones. when families cannot make it to the bedside in time, oscar also provides companionship to those who would otherwise have died alone. oscar's amazing ability prompted dr. david dosa, geriatrician

(imo). not to sound too uninformed, but what's with this war diaz seems like you really don't know why they aren't in the ufc!! sorry if i offended u killit420 y dont u smoke a bomb and forget about it \"while looking forward to the contest, diaz stated in an official release from the organization that he's upset that he'll be forced to hurt <mark>smith</mark> in the presence of his children .\" awesome. glad they did this to sorta fill the gap i think babalu left. this should be another solid strikeforce card! gj guys. it's interesting how people always say diaz has no power but the majority of his fights through his career have ended in him tkoing/koing fighters. i think his record proves he has power he just doesn't use in every punch. he peppers you then when you start to wear down he sets up the big power shot. we've seen him do it time after time in his career. i'm tired of waiting, i want to see nick back in the ufc, like him or not, he shows up to fight every single time. he doesn't fight \"not to lose\" and i as a mma appreciate that, despite his antics. more dudes who will put on the line please!! i still cant believe diaz demolished shamrock how he did. either shamrock was never as good as i thought he was or his skills have declined severely. or he is just fighting with the mentality of a ameteur these days for reasons that evade me. perhaps he thinks making himself a sacrificial lamb and standing there as a open target is entertaining the fans? i cant help but feel that something was wrong with shamrock that night because he was like a walking punchbag. has anyone seen the youtube videos of shamrock submitting legends like <mark>dan henderson</mark> in seconds in submission competitions? how shamrock submitted ground and pounders like tito. how he won against the likes of bas rutten? all due respect to frank shamrock, but diaz is a really decent boxer, and his jujitsu is fantastic. the difference, though, was his hands. he uses lots of jabs, and they might not look like much, but they a) frustrate the hell out of his opponents, b) keep them at a distance, c) sets them up for the bigger shots. seems like such a simple thing, but if you look at mma across the board, jabs are underused sorta like leg kicks, but both of those aspects seem to be making the difference in many fights. frank was the prototype of the complete mma fighter back in his heyday (and i agree, he's not finished at 36), but i don't believe he has imrpoved his style enough to be able to beat a guy as talented as diaz on most days. omg! this fight announcement is awesome! and i don't care what anyone says, in my opinion this is the fight i am most looking forward to in the future. it trumps everything else. yes indeed. this is gonna be a great night for mma! i love watching both of these guys fight, and interview, and for totally different reasons. i've got kids too, so <mark>smith</mark> usually has the heart strings attatched when he fights. i can't help but like the way diaz $hit talkes his opponents, when he feels it's deserved. so far i haven't heard him say anything bad about <mark>smith</mark>, other than the thing about beating him up in front of his kids. that's really not so bad. we'll see if any sparks fly before the fight, but there's sure to be fireworks in the cage! this'll be a tough one for ufc to counter, other than spike is free. i wonder which one they'll play. not to sound too uninformed, but what's with this war diaz thing? i keep seeing war (fill in the fighter). war diaz is just that. two dude in a cage going to war with one winnir nick diaz!!!!!!!!!!!!! as far as all the diaz haters diaz already knocked out lawler! as for why he couldn't corner his bro that was that bs weed suspencion. hell he got a crip for it. nick diaz la times interview by lance pugmire april 9, 2009 by lance pugmire april 9, 2009 for mainstream sports fans thirsting for an athlete to come completely clean about taboo subjects in sports, here's an introduction to mixed martial arts fighter nick diaz, who not only speaks openly but is willing to answer follow-up questions. \"i'm more consistent about everything being a cannabis user,\" diaz said in an interview with the times last week. \"i'm happy to get loaded, hear some good music...i remain consistent. and i have an easy way to deal with [the drug tests].\" i can pass a drug test in eight days with herbal cleansers. i drink 10 pounds of water and sweat out 10 pounds of water every day. i'll be fine. \"stockton's diaz, 25, is pitted against mma veteran frank shamrock on saturday night in san jose in the main event of the first strikeforce card on showtime since the former promotional organization elite xc folded last year.strikeforce inherited much of the elite xc roster, and shamrock-diaz will be a 179-pound catchweight bout as shamrock moves down from 185 and diaz moves up from 160 .\" this is a super important fight--for showtime to show the mma world there's a clear alternative to the ufc--and that's exactly why you're seeing this matchup of exciting, forward-moving fighters who bang, \"shamrock, 36, said .\" i respect [diaz's] talent, he brings it. \"what diaz brings beyond flying fists and the ability to shut off a foe's breathing by holding the opponent's throat against his bottom leg is unbending honesty about his marijuana use, his frustration with his former bosses at the ultimate fighting championship and his belief that steroids are pervasive in his sport .\" let 'em do it, they'll have a shorter career than me, \"said diaz (18-7 with 10 knockouts, five submissions and a no-contest).\" with all that wear and tear on their tendons, something's going to explode. i feel like these guys are hurting themselves. you can't consistently fight on steroids. \"unfortunately for diaz, state athletic commissions also ban marijuana use, and he tested positive for the illegal drug in las vegas after his impressive win over japan's takanori gomi in early 2007. a state athletic commissioner in nevada argued diaz was numb to pain because of excessive marijuana in his system. diaz's victory was vacated; he was fined and suspended for six months .\" the drug is banned because of the damage it does to the person taking it, \"said keith kizer, nevada state athletic commission executive officer .\" it could make you lethargic, slow your reflexes, and those are dangerous things in a combat sport. \"the california state athletic commission said diaz would undergo drug testing before and after saturday's fight. diaz, however, argues marijuana eases problems he has battled since childhood when, he says, he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and prescribed mood-altering medication. his rebellion as a youth forced him to relocate to schools where he continually felt out of place and he ultimately became a high school dropout .\" i like the idea of being able to fight my way out of something, \"diaz said.diaz fought on his first professional mma card at 18 and was on the ufc roster two years later. he was 7-4 in mma's premier organization, losing to two fighters who have since been suspended for steroids (sean sherk) and pain-killers (karo parisyan) and dropping another decision to current ufc lightweight title contender diego sanchez.in 2006, diaz was extended an invitation to compete on the ufc's popular\" the ultimate fighter 4 \"reality television series. he said he didn't like the idea of being continually followed by cameras and speculated his presence was more a threatened order than a request.shortly after, diaz and the ufc parted ways, although his brother nate still fights in the organization. in nick's first post-ufc fight, he tested positive for marijuana. he suspects someone tipped off authorities .\" i got high in my [hotel] room the night before every [ufc] fight, \"diaz said. but kizer said diaz was merely among 10 of 16 pride fighting championships athletes who were tested that night.diaz is 4-1 since, earning a brazilian jujitsu black belt in 2007 and complementing his intense mma training by competing in triathlons. on march 29, diaz finished fourth in his age group in an event in sacramento as part of his training for saturday's fight.said shamrock of diaz:\" he definitely smokes marijuana. that's his own business, but it's not the greatest thing for the sport. we're fighting a stigma. still, there's something refreshing about his honesty. \"diaz says he believes mma fans admire his attitude, more so than his peers .\" i don't worry about the sport, i worry about my own...teeth getting kicked in, \"diaz said. cesar pre-fight interview by <mark>michael david smith</mark> nick diaz has created quite a stir in mma circles this week by telling the los angeles times that he smokes marijuana and drinks large quantities of water to help him pass drug tests before and after his fights. i requested an interview with diaz to ask him to explain those comments, and diaz, through spokesmen, declined.but on friday i caught up with diaz's coach and manager, cesar gracie, for an interview in which we discussed diaz's marijuana use and his fight on saturday night with frank shamrock. the full interview, which touches on everything from michael phelps to diaz's participation in triathlons to the family tree of the legendary gracies, is below.michael <mark>david smith</mark>: nick told the los angeles times that he smokes marijuana. what do you make of those comments? cesar gracie: nick has a prescription for marijuana in california. he has had a prescription for the last couple years, so it's a legal drug for him. he has the prescription for adhd (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), and he says it helps him. i'm not a doctor, but he says it helps him and using marijuana is legal in california with a prescription. obviously, i'd rather he focus more on talking about fighting than on being a cannabis spokesperson, but he has a right to do what's legal in california, so i don't think it's that big a deal. it's legal by california law, but he still has to pass a test from the california state athletic commission, and he'll be in trouble if he tests positive, right? cesar: if he tests positive, yes. but what he'll do is not smoke for weeks leading up to the fight so he'll test negative. he's fought in california and passed the marijuana test. so it all worked out.he said he drinks 10 pounds of water a day. i interpreted that as saying that large quantities of water help you get the drugs out of your system. is that what he meant by that? cesar: i beileve so. he was talking about not smoking and flushing it out of his system. as much as he exercises, he burns off fat and flushes it out of his system. but remember, in california it's legal. you just can't be stoned during your fight--you can't test positive during your fight.your name is legendary in mma and brazilian jiu jitsu. what is your opinion of whether smoking marijuana is consistent with being an mma fighter or a brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner? cesar: i would have always said no, and i've told nick several times,\" athletes can't do this. \"but i guess i've been proven wrong. look at michael phelps. look at nick, who fights and does triathlons. i definitely wouldn't encourage people to use marijuana. it's my personal opinion that any kind of smoke, whether it be cigarette smoke or marijuana smoke isn't good. common sense would say it's detrimental. watching nick fight, and knowing that he participates in triathlons, it's obvious that he has very good cardio. i would think that wouldn't be consistent with smoking anything, but he has good cardio and obviously michael phelps has good cardio. cesar: i'm not a scientist and i'm not a doctor. i would be concerned with long term, 20 years from now what are his lungs going to look like? i just wouldn't gamble with that. most of the people i've met in my life who are habitual marijuana smokers are couch potatoes and don't have a lot of motivation. obviously guys like phelps, and other athletes who smoke marijuana--i've heard of pro football players smoking marijuana and they are still great athletes .--i just don't have a right to tell them don't have a beer and i also don't have a right to say not to smoke marijuana. it's a medical prescription that he has a prescription for. i don't think it's that big of a deal. it's not cheating. remember, the athletic commission, their argument for banning marijuana is actually that it could hurt you--you could be lethargic and unable to protect yourself. it's not cheating, it's that it could be to your detriment. that's why they don't want you to be on it. it's not like steroids. i think the media should focus on serious issues like steroids and pain pills, not minor issues like this.let's talk about the fight. you have fought frank shamrock. what's your scouting report on him? cesar: i think he's a hard hitter. he's an athlete. he's explosive. he's very strong. he's a really good mma striker. he's got so much experience and he brings that experience into the cage with him, so you're not going to surprise him. he's got a winner's mentality. he's going to make you earn it, for sure. i was a little surprised when this fight was announced, just because nick has fought at lightweight and frank shamrock has fought at middleweight. is 179 pounds a good weight for this fight? cesar: nick would have taken that fight at any weight. he's a fighter. he's one of those guys who's going to take the fight because he wants the challenge. when he was fighting at lightweight, that was a tremendous cut for him and i really didn't like to see him that light. it took him a long time to get there and i don't think he was at his best at lightweight. i think nick and frank will walk into the cage at about the same weight. obviously frank is more used to fighting around that weight so that might be an advantage. we're a couple of hours from the weigh in. what will nick weigh in at today? cesar: about 180, same as frank, probably. the weight class is 179 with a one-pound allowance, so i assume both guys will come in at 180. what kind of shape is nick in right now? will he have any rust because he hasn't fought in a while? cesar: it's been a while but frank is coming off a layoff and his arm was broken from a kick. he's in good shape and i think it's going to be a good fight.how do you think strikeforce is coming along after buying the elitexc assets? cesar: it's doing well. i've been around some of these mma promotions that were like a dot-com start-up, coming in and spending crazy money, hiring too many people and giving ridiculous contracts to some of the fighters, paying people what they weren't worth. scott coker, the head of strikeforce, is a different kind of planner. he's doing things the right way. i think he's going to be very successful. i know you also coach gilbert melendez, who's on the co-main event. how's he doing and what do you expect us to see from him saturday night? cesar: gilbert is in phenomenal shape. he really is. unfortunately josh thomson broke his leg, and now gilbert is fighting a different kind of opponent in rodrigo damm, so he's having to make some adjustments. he's a dangerous submission specialist with good stand-up and good wrestling skills, so he's well rounded. gilbert doesn't have quite the pedigree in submission grappling that (damm) does, but i think he's ready for this fight and in shape for a five-rounder. you have by far the most famous last name in brazilian jiu jitsu. just to clarify, are you royce gracie's first cousin? cesar: you know, i don't know what that is. second cousin, i think. his father is my great uncle. we've had people in the family having kids until they're 60 years old or something, so it's kind of funny. royce should be a lot older than me. so he's a generation older than you but he's not many years older than you? yeah. exactly. cesar: i think that makes him your cousin once removed.that sounds right. cousin once removed? that sounds good.well, thanks for your time. is there anything else you want to say? cesar: just that i hope it's clear that i'm definitely not a proponent of the whole marijuana thing or whatever ....which makes me think...can anyone else see strikeforce booking", "articleID": "2009042816_00029593_W", "names": {"Dan Henderson": ["Q19282274", "Q33120424", "Q548861"], "David Smith": ["Q1176671", "Q1176674",
