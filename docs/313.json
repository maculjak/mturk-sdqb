Hacking in the gaming world has \"occurred as long as online gaming has existed,\" he said. \"Gaming has always been an arena for hacking and attacks,\" he said. \"In the early days that meant cracking software licenses to play games for free.

Plans have been submitted for the development at Irelands Field, Heckington - between Boston Road and Cobham close - to North Kesteven District Council. Permission for a different development of 50 homes at the site was granted in 2014 and this application, which has also been earmarked for approval, would bring the total up to 100 homes on the site.

director of operations, street superintendent, public works director and director of water and sewage. \"he plans to continue those jobs,\" he stated. cater said the city does not have a contract with riner; he serves at the pleasure of the council from meeting to meeting on a day-to-day basis. other items discussed at the workshop:? city clerk rona martin discussed the board report. there still remain some vacancies. also, juanita taylor withdrew her application from the greater tift county planning and zoning commission, leaving that spot vacant. <mark>smith</mark> mentioned that <mark>keri jones</mark> has withdrew her application as well and pointed out that jan wise, who is interested in serving on the planning and zoning board, was willing to come to the workshop and would answer any questions. martin noted that there is a vacancy on the tifton tree board. parrott stated, \"we need more people to serve .\" ? riner addressed the downtown development authority board's recommendation to the council to decide if they want to accept ownership of the tift theatre. due to a question involving a conflict of interest, the council decided to discuss the matter later after wilmot researches the issue and looks into it more .? ricky hobby gave a report on the bid for a knuckle boom truck and loader for the sanitation department in the daily collection of residential yard debris. he informed the council that this unit is a replacement for unit #803, which is in need of extensive repairs, and that due to the age of the vehicle and loader, it is not feasible to make these repairs. hobby stated that the current unit is nine years old. he said the new unit will be purchased using funds from the solid waste capital replacement account. he stated that the lowest proposal offered that met specs was from consolidated disposal systems from smyrna. the amount was $116,686 .? also discussed were resolutions providing for the extension of senior garbage rates, alcoholic beverage license for citgo food mart on west seventh street and alcoholic beverage license for sam's grocery & grill on highway 41 north. to contact reporter latasha everson, call 382-4321."}, {"articleID": "2018091717_00241013_W", "names": {"Darren Lewis": ["Q5225019", "Q5225021"]}, "date": "2018-09-17", "url": "https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/toby-alderweireld-kieran-trippier-left-13261727", "content": "Sport Toby Alderweireld and Kieran Trippier left out of Spurs squad for Inter Milan clash for \"technical reasons\" Both centre back Alderweireld and full-back Trippier have started all four of Spurs Premier League games so far this season Share By <mark>Darren Lewis</mark> 17:53, 17 SEP 2018 Updated 18:39, 17 SEP 2018 Sport Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe See our privacy notice Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Mauricio Pochettino has taken a Champions League gamble by leaving Toby Alderweireld and Kieran Trippier out of his squad to face Inter Milan tonight. The Spurs boss maintained his move to axe his star defender and England's best player at the World Cup is a \"technical decision\" , not a punishment after defeat to Liverpool last Saturday. He said: \"It's a technical decision. You can look it up, find it in the dictionary. A technical decision .\" Tactical is on the pitch. Yeah maybe tactical is outside of the pitch too. But it's technical decision, tactical decision, it's a decision in the end. You cannot bring 25 players. You can only play 11 players with seven on the bench. That is the reason. \"(Image: REUTERS) Kieran Trippier will also not feature against Inter (Image: REUTERS) Hugo Lloris and Dele Alli are still out injured for Tottenham's opener but Pochettino added:\" I never punish players because you win and lose. The plan is to leave them and use different players. \"There's nothing behind it. Only that we will play with different players. We believe the best decision is to play with different players .\" But it has once more plunged the future of Alderweireld into doubt. Spurs fans have been hoping that the former Southampton and Atletico Madrid defender could be persuaded to commit his long-term future to the club after a summer in limbo. But now, with less than two years left on his current deal, Alderweireld could leave for just \u00a3 25million during a two-week window next summer because of a clause in his contract. Mauricio Pochettino has revealed Spurs' team news (Image: AFP) The Belgian centre-back was frozen out of the Spurs team last season - only to play in six out of his country's seven games during the summer at the World Cup. He was priced out of a move to Manchester United where he would have been lining up against Young Boys tomorrow night but now finds himself out in the cold again. Pochettino insists Tottenham's supporters need not be worried about lining up against Inter - who return to the competition after a six-year absence - without two of his his key players. He added: \"Why would the fans be concerned? We win or we lose. Against Liverpool they play and we lose. The fans might be concerned because we didn't play Davinson Sanchez or Serge Aurier.

(Getty) Seahawks coach Pete Carroll put it plainly Sunday afternoon. \"I didn't do a good enough job,\" he told reporters after Seattle held on for a 27-20 win over a struggling Atlanta Falcons team. \"I'm telling you. Obviously, they went out there and we looked like we were a totally different team .\" Seahawks 27, Falcons 20: Recap & photo gallery | Britt hurt The Falcons outscored the Seahawks 20-3 in the second half of their contest in Atlanta. After halftime, they outgained Seattle 346 to 82 in net yards and had 21 first downs compared to just three for the Seahawks. Quarterback Matt Schaub, who started for the first time since 2015 in place of an injured <mark>Matt Ryan</mark>, was 26 of 32 for 309 yards. Seahawks quarterback <mark>Russell Wilson</mark>--a leader in the league's MVP race--had just five pass attempts against an Atlanta defense that ranks near the bottom of the league against the pass. You'd hardly guess the Seahawks won by a touchdown. But they did, and they were able to keep the Falcons at bay and improve to 6-2 thanks to a stellar first half. Seattle pulled ahead 24-0 in what was a dominant performance on both sides of the ball. <mark>Wilson</mark> and the Seahawks' offense had 240 yards and converted on all three of their trips into the red zone. <mark>Wilson</mark> himself was 9 of 15 passing for two touchdown against a porous Falcons defense. Running back <mark>Chris Carson</mark> bulldozed through defenders for 86 yards and another touchdown. Cornerback Shaquill Griffin had two tackles and two passes defensed and the secondary held its own despite being short a starting corner (Tre Flowers). Linebacker Mychal Kendricks made his first interception as a Seahawk and pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney sacked Schaub in a play that also forced a fumble in the final seconds of the second quarter. The first-half Seahawks boasted a franchise quarterback who made jaw-dropping plays to a top-tier veteran receiver, a punishing running back who could drag defenders for additional yardage, a young corner who flashed promise and veteran savvy in the front seven. They stayed competitive despite losing their starting center. They looked like an NFC contender. The second-half Seahawks? That's a different story. What remains to be seen is whether it remains the story of Seattle's season. A showing from Schaub For the second time this season, the Seahawks allowed 400 or more yards by an opposing passer. Cincinnati's <mark>Andy Dalton</mark> threw for 418 yards and two touchdowns in the season opener (a total that led all quarterbacks in Week 1), and on Sunday it was the 38-year-old Schaub who threw for 460 yards, one touchdown and one interception. It was the most passing yards any Seahawks team has allowed by an opposing quarterback during Carroll's coaching tenure. The next closest is Ben Roethlisberger, who threw for 456 yards against Seattle in November 2015. That's not to say Schaub didn't make mistakes. In fact, maybe that's why he's yet another name on a very interesting list: Quarterbacks who have lost to the Seahawks while throwing 400-plus yards. It now totals seven, according to 710 ESPN Seattle's Danny O\u2019Neil: Under Pete Carroll, #Seahawks are undefeated when allowing an opponent to throw for more than 400 yards! pic.twitter.com/BI4p2XersW--Danny O'Neil (@ dannyoneil) October 27, 2019 Wagner sets a new Seahawks record Sunday also brought a new franchise record. Linebacker Bobby Wagner has now registered more tackles than any other player in Seahawks history (985). \"He's got plenty of years left,\" Carroll said of the 29-year-old Wagner, who signed a three-year extension in July that keeps him under contract with Seattle through 2022. \"I don't know how anybody could ever break that record. I think he's going to own that forever. That's amazing that he's there already. But just a tribute to the unbelievable player that he is, his discipline, his toughness, his work ethic, everything. That's an incredible number .\" Follow 710 ESPN Seattle's Stacy Rost on Twitter.

A makeshift hospital has been set up in a Manhattan convention center. Over the next few weeks, spaces including pro tennis courts, college dorms and a cruise ship terminal are supposed to start housing patients as New York state races to roughly triple its hospital capacity. And still, officials worry whether the massive effort will be enough in the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. A recent state chart tallying the planned hospital beds ended with question marks about how much space might be found in nursing homes. Some hospital and city leaders have questioned whether too much temporary hospital space is being reserved for patients who don't have the virus that causes COVID-19, though there are now plans to shift one big temporary site's focus to caring for them. And officials underscore that beds alone can't solve a problem growing by more than 1,000 hospitalizations a day. \"Beds, we can find. Not easy, but we can find them. The harder components are the staff and the supplies,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. As he spoke, over 13,300 coronavirus patients were hospitalized and more than 3,300 needed intensive care around the state, though mostly in New York City. The outbreak's expected peak was still seven to 30 days away, the Democrat said. When that happens, New York expects to need 140,000 hospital beds--compared to the 53,000 it had when the crisis began. So many seriously ill patients are anticipated that New York City is preparing to turn all its 20,000 permanent hospital beds into intensive care ones, while trying to add 65,000 temporary beds for other patients. For most people, the new virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with chronic health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal. It has killed over 2,300 people in New York state so far, according to the governor. The scramble for hospital space, staff and ventilators is intended to ward off a dire worst-case scenario: medical centers becoming so swamped that some people die whose lives could otherwise be saved. Even though they are working to squeeze in thousands of extra beds, some New York City facilities have been overloaded at times, transferring patients around the city and sometimes as far away as the Albany area. Emergency rooms at Mount Sinai Health System's Brooklyn and Queens hospitals started getting backed up over the weekend, emergency medicine chair Dr. <mark>Brendan Carr</mark> said. Patient transfers to larger Mount Sinai hospitals ultimately eased the crunch. But if not for that, \"two of our hospitals would be in terrible distress,\" he said Wednesday. \"That can't keep going. We're continuing to grow capacity at all these hospitals, but at some point, we run out of space,\" he said. Some relief is now in sight, even from the windows of Mount Sinai's flagship hospital in Manhattan. Across Fifth Avenue, white tents now cover much of Central Park's East Meadow. They form a 68-bed emergency field hospital for coronavirus patients that opened Wednesday. Nine patients were being cared for Thursday, according to Samaritan's Purse, the evangelical Christian relief group running the operation. The group's opposition to same-sex marriage sparked concern among some of New York's Democratic political leaders. The organization's CEO, the Rev. Franklin Graham, told Fox News on Monday that \"we're going to give the best health care we can to all New Yorkers--it doesn't matter who they are or what they are .\" State, city and federal officials say they have lined up--and in some cases, opened--dozens of additional spots for temporary hospitals around the metropolitan area. A Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, is docked in Manhattan with 750 beds, three of them occupied as of Thursday, commanding officer Capt. Patrick Amersbach said in a telephone news briefing. The Javits Center, a glassy convention facility where such events as New York Comic Con and the New York International Auto Show usually take place, now houses a federally-run hospital, with 2,500 beds as of Thursday, according to Cuomo. Officials also are tapping colleges, the Aqueduct horse-racing track, a part of the tennis center that hosts the U.S. Open, a Brooklyn cruise terminal, and 20 hotels so far. Decisions on routing patients to the temporary hospitals are made from a state-run operations hub set up in the Javits Center, according to city Emergency Management Office spokesman Omar Bourne. A similar system has been used before during such disasters as Superstorm Sandy. Some facilities are intended for COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization, but not intensive care. Others, including the Comfort and the Javits Center, were designated for patients who don't have the virus but need care for other reasons--though President Donald Trump said Thursday evening that the Javits would switch to caring for coronavirus patients. New York officials and hospital leaders had urged a change in focus. \"You're only going to help if you take the patients that we need help with, which is COVID patients,\" Michael Dowling, CEO of Northwell Health, said before Thursday's announcement. \"If they don't relieve us of the pressure that we're under, then I'm not sure the utility .\" While scouring for temporary hospital space, state and city officials are also sounding even more urgent calls for ventilators, medical personnel and protective gear for them. Cuomo warned Thursday that the state's supply of breathing machines could be exhausted in six days if the current rate of critical COVID-19 illness continues. Democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio asked the federal government this week to supply 1,000 nurses, 150 doctors and 300 respiratory therapists by Sunday. \"The bed,\" he said, \"is only as good as the supplies, the equipment, and especially the people that go with it .\" ------Associated Press writers Michael R.
