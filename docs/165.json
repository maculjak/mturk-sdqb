jonathan vilma and seven witnesses testified thursday that nfl commissioner roger goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal, a federal judge decided against making an immediate ruling on whether the suspended saints' linebacker could temporarily return to work. regardless of the outcome, the hearing gave vilma and several current and former teammates, as well as saints assistant head coach joe vitt, a chance to explain why they believe nfl investigators \"misconstrued\" evidence gathered in their bounty investigation and incorrectly concluded that the saints had a program in place that offered cash bonuses for tackles that injured opponents. \"everything i've worked for has been basically thrown down the toilette,\" vilma said when asked about the harm his bounty suspension has done to both his pro career and charitable work that includes building schools in haiti. \"it hurts. it's tough to swallow because it's not who i am .\" vilma has asked u.s. district judge ginger berrigan to impose a temporary restraining order against the nfl while his lawsuit against goodell proceeds. vilma's suit accuses the commissioner of defamation and also asks berrigan to permanently overturn goodell's decision to suspend vilma for the entire 2012 season. nfl attorneys did not attempt to challenge testimony denying the existence of a bounty program. rather, they argued the real question in vilma's case was whether the federal courts had jurisdiction to overturn a process that was collectively bargained. they noted that multiple system arbitrators have already agreed that goodell has followed the very policies for imposing discipline to which players agreed in the league's labor agreement. \"mr. vilma may not like that bargain but it's not for him? or this court to decide,\" nfl attorney gregg levy argued. berrigan did not say when she would rule on the temporary restraining order that vilma's attorney requested in thursday's seven-hour hearing. however, she is attempting to fast-track vilma's lawsuit, along with a separate but parallel lawsuit brought by nfl players association on behalf of three other current or former saints slapped with partial-season suspensions in the bounty matter: <mark>will smith</mark>, scott fujita and anthony hargrove. berrigan did say she was troubled by some of the nfl's arguments. she said goodell's contention that players were being punished for actions that occurred not on the field, but in meeting rooms and locker rooms, \"borders on ridiculous,\" and cited it as one of several examples of \"slicing the salami very thin .\" goodell has stated that he has jurisdiction because he is dealing with conduct detrimental to the game, not for on-field infractions that require the use of an arbitrator other than the commissioner. vilma attorney peter ginsberg said that goodell violated the cba by failing to serve as a neutral arbitrator. he said goodell's bias in the matter was evident in his public comments even before he handed down players' suspensions. goodell \"is allowed to be commissioner and arbitrator. he is not allowed to pre-judge,\" ginsberg said. current new orleans defensive players roman harper, sedrick ellis, jonathan casillas and scott shanle testified on vilma's behalf, along with retired former teammates <mark>troy evans</mark> and randall gay. they denied ever seeing vilma offer $10,000 cash knocking quarterbacks brett favre or kurt warner out of the 2009-10 nfc playoffs, as the nfl has said he did. the witnesses also corroborated vilma's description of some of the terms that the nfl has highlighted in its report about the bounty program. they explained that the term \"kill the head\" means to legally stop a ball carrier's forward progress, to literally turn his body so that his head is facing sideways or backward, and not in the direction the offense was trying to go. they testified the term \"whack\" described legal hit below the waist in which a ball carrier in the open field has his legs cut out from under him. a \"cart-off,\" they said, also was a legal hit, albeit one that forced a player to take at least a few plays off to re-gather himself. they described a \"knockout\" as a high-impact, dramatic and legal hit that did not necessarily result in injury. they also testified that the pool they were involved in was a pay-for-performance pool that largely rewarded big plays such as forced fumbles, sacks or interceptions, but added that the program also fined players for mental errors or penalties including unnecessary roughness. vitt, sometimes pausing with emotion, praised vilma as one of the finest players he has ever known, and someone as important to new orleans' defense as record-setting quarterback drew brees is to the saints' offense. vitt described vilma as an intelligent, hardworking and unselfish player whose teammates overwhelmingly elected him as defensive captain. \"when these grown men who make a lot of money vote for this man to lead them into critical situations, and make critical calls? and be there for them in times of need, personally, i think it speaks volumes,\" vitt said. vilma wants a swift ruling because he is rehabilitating his surgically repaired left knee and said doing so at the saints' facility is far more productive than doing it on his own. vitt added that when players rehabilitate injuries at team headquarters, they do so with trainers who have a \"personal vested interest\" in the player's health. despite not getting an immediate temporary restraining order allowing him to rejoin the saints, vilma appeared to be in good spirits as he left court. \"in a perfect world, that would have happened, but there's a lot for the judge to go over right now and i'm definitely not going to try to rush her,\" vilma said. \"i hope she gets it right and i hope it's in my favor .\" rules for posting comments comments posted below are from readers. in no way do they

rendered homeless and are in relief camps need urgent help by tcn staff reporter, new delhi: first devastating flood and now bloody riots have made lakhs of people, mostly muslims, homeless in various districts of assam. with humanitarian crisis looming large as the victims are not getting proper support from the government, markazul ma'arif, which is working in collaboration with jamiat ulema, assam and ajmal foundation, has issued an appeal for help. \"in the ongoing communal riot from 18 july 2012 in 7 districts of assam including 4 under the bodoland territorial council (btc), according to our estimate some 3 lakh people are already displaced, they virtually lost everything save life. here we are deliberately not mentioning the figure of those killed in the ethnic riot because the official figure 52 till 27 july is completely contradictory from what we have from ground. majority of the victims are poor bengali speaking muslims. similarly the present flood situation in assam has been devastating which succumbed around 150 lives and some 25 lakhs people became homeless,\" said markazul ma'arif in the appeal. \"our officials and volunteers are working in the affected areas. we seek urgent financial assistance from philanthropist ngos as well as individuals for the ongoing relief works in assam,\" the group appealed. talking to tcn over phone, maulana burhanuddin qasmi, director, markazul ma'arif said his group in collaboration with state jamiat ulema and ajmal foundation had set up relief camps in boangaigaon, nagaon, dhubri and goalpara districts for flood victims. there were around 50000 people in those camps. they had started to provide them food packed for 30 days. each packet for an average five-member family contained 30kg rice, 6kg pulse, 4kg sugar, 2kg salt, 3kg gram and 1/2kg tea leaf, each packet costing rs 1000. in total it was a rs 8 crore project. but all of a sudden communal riot broke out in several districts of assam, making many more lakh people homeless. maulana qasmi said, the riot was so sudden and fast that at organizational level they could not set up camps. victims fled their homes and villages and they were given shelters in neighboring districts. \"right now our volunteers under the leadership of mp maulana badruddin ajmal are visiting camps in villages and towns and providing relief at the sites. we are providing food and plastic tents,\" said maulana qasmi. he informed that villagers erected relief camps in dhubri, bongaigaon, chirang and kokrajhar districts. how to donate for inland contributions: account

reuters file pic london, july 29 - the history of sport is studded with great anglo-australian clashes and that rivalry is spilling over into the business world as the two nations vie for juicy contracts from future olympics and world cup hosts. the stakes are high. brazil, russia and qatar will all stage major sports events over the next decade and are also spending heavily to build roads, railways and power plants to serve their fast-growing economies. australia, its reputation sealed by the success of the sydney olympics in 2000, styles itself as \"the go-to nation\" for major projects in a sports industry that is forecast to be worth us $145 billion (rm457 .8 billion) by 2015. \"sport is in our core, it's part of who we are and as a platform for business there is nothing better,\" australian sports minister kate lundy said at a reception in london yesterday evening to woo potential overseas clients. sports administrators and politicians from qatar, brazil and russia were on the guest list as australia showed how its companies could play a part in every step of the 10-year life cycle of major sports events - from bidding to post-games legacy - in a series of computer presentations. it is a model britain wants its companies to emulate after many of them were given work at the olympic park in east london, the centrepiece of a games funded by? 9 billion (rm44 .6 billion) of public money. \"in terms of the olympics, sydney is the benchmark on which london works,\" said british sports minister <mark>hugh robertson</mark>, an interested spectator as lundy spoke under the chandeliers at the australian high commission. \"our legislation is based on sydney and quite a lot of australian companies are involved in the delivery of the london games. we're sort of the oldest rivals and the greatest friends,\" he told reuters. foot in door <mark>john armitt</mark>, who heads the olympic delivery authority that oversaw the building of the london venues, believes the global exposure from the games should be good for british business. \"london is a massive shop window in terms of showing the world what we have been able to achieve here and building on the back of it,\" he said. brazil hosts the soccer world cup in 2014 and olympics in rio de janeiro in 2016. fellow emerging economic power russia stages the 2014 winter games in sochi and 2018 world cup. britain has broken off security cooperation with russia after the 2006 murder in london of kremlin critic <mark>alexander litvinenko</mark>. that limits the ability of its companies to bid for contracts to build stadia for the 2018 world cup where security needs to be addressed before construction can begin. after russia, the world cup will head to wealthy qatar which has plenty of money but little in the way of soccer grounds. <mark>armitt</mark> stressed the value of breaking into such markets when britain is locked in recession and the government is cutting spending on big building projects at home. \"if you look at what is happening in qatar, yes it's building new stadia for the football but alongside it there is just an ongoing very large investment in infrastructure and other sorts of buildings,\" he said. <mark>armitt</mark> cited the example of british builder carillion which was involved in the olympic park in london and recently won a 395 million pounds commercial property development contract in the qatari capital of doha. \"as with all international markets, it's a case of getting your foot in the door on the back of something,\" he said. it was inevitable that contractors would find themselves fighting their own version of the sporting contests that have helped to define britain's relations with \"down under'. guan eng mahu hishamuddin susun semula polis, ramaikan yang perangi jenayah, kurangkan intipan politik karpal singh jadikan pertuduhan hasutan dihadapinya sebagai isu pada pru-13", "articleID": "2012072902_00039684_W", "names": {"Alexander Litvinenko": ["Q18274700", "Q57410220"], "Eduardo Paes": ["Q56556418", "Q972007"], "Hugh Robertson": ["Q1824635", "Q22110135", "Q27830915", "Q480170", "Q5932499"]}}]
