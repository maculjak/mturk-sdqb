The article does not really give any reasons for the departure, but you have to suspect that Boniol wants to test the market for his services elsewhere, perhaps as a special teams coordinator. Fisher goes on to say that this is an indication that special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia, another coach who is almost universally seen as having been very successful in 2013, is not likely to be leaving. Bisaccia has a couple of interviews for head coaching positions set up, and his loss would almost certainly have been a negative for Dallas.

BARBIE Mattgregor has always been a work in progress for Junortoun trainer Dylan Marshall. But the 31-year-old hopes he has gone some way to unlocking the secret to the four-year-old mare, after her win at Maryborough on Thursday. Barbie Mattgregor, who is raced by Steve Clements, from the Brisbane Pastoral Company, has done the bulk of her racing - 35 starts in total - in Queensland and New South Wales - under three individual trainers. Her last six runs have been in Victoria under the stewardship of Marshall, who is the only trainer to get a win with the mare. The hobby trainer, who works full-time as a diesel mechanic, took some encouragement from Barbie Mattgregor's maiden win.\" She has been a bit of a project horse...she had 30-odd starts before yesterday (Thursday) and has been one of those horses who has taken a lot of working out, \"he said.\" They didn't go any spectacular time, but she got the job done. \"With a bit of luck and a sharp breeze, hopefully we have worked her out a bit.\" Being a day meeting, Marshall unfortunately missed the win, with his partner Tayla Fellows taking on the handling duties. The couple operate only a small team of horses from their base, opposite Lord's Raceway, but clearly relish the involvement after more than 10 years in the industry. \"There has been bits and pieces (of success) along the way; we have only ever had a small team, no more than five or six,\" Marshall said. He said Barbie Mattgregor, who was driven for the first time by Michael Bellman on Thursday, would next run at Ballarat on April 16. \"We are trying to keep her to a mile, she doesn't really get the longer trip,\" Marshall said. \"We will certainly have a bit more confidence in her than we did beforehand.\" Also among the winners on Thursday was Longlea trainer <mark>John McDermott</mark>, who scored with Whata Challenge. The five-year-old gelding now has wins in two of his past four starts for McGregor, who has raced the horse since January last year, after formerly being trained by Matt Craven.

Ian Mallon - 13 June 2013 THE year is 1971 and a group of councillors are sitting around discussing the mad idea of putting a \"dual carriageway' (the word motorway was too British at the time) around Dublin. New RAV4 is bigger, bolder, better...and a staggering? 5,000 cheaper Mercedes hoping young owners will opt for\" baby' coupe Look, no hands! My car is driving itself Everybody is falling about at the mad notion of such a thing. One councillor looks set to explode in tears and snot as he can no longer contain his laughter, while another is almost sick with giddy hilarity. The man who brought up the idea lights a cigarette and sits back down, his humiliation complete. The answer to his earlier private consultation about whether he should bring such a notion to the table now very much apparent. And so began the longest running comedy in transport, which was back with a brand new series last week thanks to more cack-handed suggestions from the brains trust which now run such matters. CONTROVERSY And so more than 40 years after the very idea of the M50 was first mooted, it is still causing much controversy, if not as much hilarity. This time around the suggestion is to penalise anybody who uses the entire M50 every day to the tune of? 6.50 - more than three times its current rate. The very idea of putting in five different tolling areas on the M50 goes against everything that we stand for here at Herald Motoring. And the fact that the matter is even on the table without consideration for those who will be out of pocket to the tune of? 32.50 a week for using a road designed to get you around Dublin, is perverse. Leo Varadkar will say such a thing won't happen on his watch - sure isn't the M50 a big part of his constituency. But it looks like the M50 will be getting more and more toll spots in the future, and if there are no provisions in place for the many people who use the entire road every day, well that would be a travesty. Just off the M50 at Ballymount sits the HQ of Kia Ireland, a place that is getting more and more exciting with each visit. This time around I took possession of the Kia pro_cee'd, a lovely looking medium sized car - a heady mix of hot hatch meets cool coupe. The pro_cee'd comes in 1.4 and 1.6 litre diesel engines and comes in at just under? 23,000. The car has been transformed into an extremely sporty and pacy looking machine, thanks to a roofline which has been lowered substantially. When I read about lower rooflines I always fear for my medium sized head, every time I get into any newly height-challenged models. But this is not an issue with the newly-sized c \"eed, which from the inside feels roomy and almost vast for what you are getting. Apart from having a name that looks like it was created in Silicon Valley, the pro_ceed is a car for the modern ages. It is sporty, comfortable and performs majestically, giving a greater impression than all of its considerable sum parts. The people in Kia say it as\" a more sophisticated car \"and I tend to agree. The new range of Kia cars completely reinforce the stats that Kia is one of only three car brands in the world selling more cars than ever before. This mix of modernity and class make for some exciting times ahead for Kia and its increasing stable of thoroughbreds.

five factors explaining that remarkable arc emerge from <mark>williams</mark>' narrative, each building upon one another. the first is <mark>williams</mark>' love of basketball, the activity that freed his mind from other worries and provided a badly needed outlet and a way to spend the time alone. the second was unquestionably his mother along with his sister. <mark>williams</mark> was fully indulged in his love for the game by his mother, who never complained about his bouncing the ball at home and later recorded <mark>roy</mark>'s scoring statistics during all his high school games. and, famously, she always left a dime for young <mark>roy</mark> to get a coke after his daily pickup basketball games. third, and perhaps least well known by tar heel fans, is the role of the local asheville community, particularly high school coach buddy baldwin. <mark>williams</mark> gives many large and small examples of the way people in the community looked after him, but baldwin played the key role, starting with words of encouragement he offered to <mark>roy</mark> after his 9th grade season on the junior varsity, suggesting he could be a varsity player. that inspired <mark>williams</mark> to bust his butt all summer so he could make that team (and indeed be a starter). more importantly, it inspired <mark>williams</mark> to want to be a coach. it felt good to be appreciated as a player and to be motivated to succeed by the words from baldwin. <mark>williams</mark> recognized (unusually early in life) how great it must feel to be able to make that kind of difference in someone else's life. fourth, there is the university of north carolina and everything that comes with it. <mark>williams</mark> turned down basketball scholarships and numerous small schools to come to chapel hill, knowing he would only ever be a junior varsity player for carolina - if he made that team. but, encouraged by baldwin, he reasoned that his best chance of becoming a basketball coach was to hook on to the carolina program and learn from <mark>dean smith</mark>. through a series of events whose common thread is <mark>williams</mark>' own persistence and passion for the game, he did get that opportunity in chapel hill despite never being a varsity player. but it was the existence of a large scale public university committed to providing opportunities to talented students from all over the state that made <mark>williams</mark>' career trajectory possible. this brings us to the fifth factor explaining how <mark>williams</mark> eventually become a magnificently successful head coach at kansas and north carolina: <mark>williams</mark> himself. <mark>williams</mark> does not blow his horn too much in this department, but one thing that comes through in the book is what a good student he was in high school - he was even offered an academic scholarship to georgia tech. the second obvious thing that comes out is just how driven <mark>williams</mark> was from a very early age, and his capacity for, yes, \"hard work,\" a drive that is inseparable from his love of competition. intelligence, passion and work ethic are generally a powerful combination. but they are more powerful still when connected to particular sense about what one wants to do with one's life. <mark>roy williams</mark> recognized that it was basketball and a basketball coach that kept his difficult and stressful childhood from translating into an aimless life marked by no goals and no serious aspirations. <mark>williams</mark> coaches now to win games and satisfy his own competitive drive, no doubt. but he also recognizes that the fundamental purpose of coaching is to inspire others, and that what is most important about basketball and sports in general is its capacity to shape young people's lives. <mark>williams</mark> quotes an inscription given to him by a former unc jv player stating, \"the true measure of a man's greatness is not in the number of his accomplishments, but in the number of people's lives he inspired while achieving those accomplishments.\" corny as all get out? maybe, but that doesn't make it wrong. that phrase sums up as well as any how <mark>williams</mark> sees his vocation. what the first fifty pages of this book does is show exactly how and why <mark>williams</mark> thought pursuing that vocation was the most valuable thing he could do with his life. *** i was surprised at how moved i was by this book. as someone who's followed <mark>williams</mark>' career every step of the way from his initial hire by <mark>smith</mark> in 1978 - my brother attended one of the unc faculty/staff kids clinics <mark>williams</mark> recalls in the book - and as someone who even had <mark>williams</mark> as a coach for one memorable week of carolina basketball school, i assumed i knew pretty well what <mark>williams</mark> is about. but this book rounds out and adds to the picture in important and at times surprising ways. yes, you will understand <mark>roy williams</mark> \"a little better\" by reading this book. i'll go further and say that the time was right for a book like this. at a similar point in <mark>dean smith</mark>'s career, the journalist thad mumau wrote an informative biography of <mark>smith</mark> called \"more than a coach\" that recounted his kansas childhood, drawing on interviews with <mark>smith</mark>'s family members, including his parents. the book had a lot of insight into <mark>smith</mark> and where he got his values and aspirations from. <mark>williams</mark> had a very different childhood than <mark>smith</mark> and in some respects is a very different person as well. one measure of that difference is the fact that only <mark>williams</mark> could have told his own story: he dedicates the book to his mother, father, and sister, saying he wish they could read his words. even if a journalist had had access to his family members before they passed away, they wouldn't have been able to convey what exactly it feels like to be an 11-year-old from a family having a difficult time, dribbling a basketball for hours and hours on a muddy court - an essential part of this story. another measure of that difference is that one senses that, at some level, <mark>williams</mark> needed to tell some of these stories - some quite painful, others simply poignant. these aren't the kind of stories you casually mention in an interview. the autobiography format gives him an opportunity to share parts of his life and indeed parts of his soul that otherwise might never have found public expression. economic stress and borderline poverty are still difficult topics for many americans to face or talk about. <mark>williams</mark>' childhood was difficult in many ways, but in other ways he was quite blessed - in particular, blessed to be part of a community that cared about him and encouraged him to develop himself, and not allow himself to be constrained by his circumstances. it is not a clich\u00e9 but simply truth that millions of kids in america today, december 2009, face economic and family circumstances as tough or tougher than those young <mark>roy williams</mark> faced. some of those kids, thousands and thousands, are probably still finding a measure of solace and comfort from shooting baskets, for hours and hours. i hope those kids are also lucky enough to get the kind of support and inspiration <mark>roy williams</mark> got from his family, his coaches, his teachers, his friends' parents, and the community at large. and i hope that readers of <mark>williams</mark>' book will take to heart the deepest underlying message of the book - <mark>williams</mark>' gratitude and appreciation towards those who gave him the love, guidance and encouragement required to make great things possible. <mark>williams</mark>' book recollects a community that didn't let him fall through the cracks. as those cracks get wider with every passing month, <mark>roy williams</mark>' life story serves as a quiet but moving reminder of the need to restore those kinds of communities again, in north carolina and everywhere else."}, {"articleID": "2019122503_00028272_W", "names": {"King Kong": ["Q2171232", "Q22278621", "Q6411824"]}, "date": "2019-12-25", "url": "http://www.echonews.com.au/news/simple-rule-behind-aussies-30m-empire/3909373/", "content": "Business Simple rule behind Aussie's $30m empire by Alexis Carey 25th Dec 2019 1:58 PM 0 When Aussie man Sabri Suby was young, he watched his single mum juggle three exhausting jobs to support her kids. She would then return to the family's Byron Bay home only to start cooking healthy, homemade meals for him and his sister, and it taught him one crucial, lifelong lesson - something he dubs the \"single mum work ethic\" . It had a \"profound impact\" , and as soon as he could, Mr Suby began taking on after-school jobs to help out, including his first role grinding peanut butter at a health food store for just $2.50 an hour. \"I also started busking at markets with my harmonica on the weekends trying to earn $80 to $100 to help with electricity bills or groceries - I gave all my money to my mum,\" he told news.com. au. Sabri Suby worked multiple jobs as a teen to help his single mum but now runs a $30 million company. \"Watching her work so hard had a profound effect on me and it has served me in life.\" You might have more connections or have grown up in a better area or with two parents, but one thing you can't take away from me is my work ethic. \"Mr Suby got an after-school sales job at 16 and discovered a natural knack for it. After finishing high school, he made a conscious decision not to go straight to uni, so he packed his bags and moved to London for two years, working in sales\" door to door, face-to-face and over the phone \". Again, it was an industry he thrived in, and he decided to move back to Australia and study business marketing at RMIT. He worked full time for a company selling Google AdWords and specialising in online marketing and search engine optimisation to support himself as he studied, making a near-minimum wage base salary and earning sales commissions on top. However, he was\" not living a lavish lifestyle by any means \"and the wage was\" just enough to survive \"- so at 21, he started his own business after realising he could do things better. It made more than a million dollars in revenue, and Mr Suby went on to launch a string of other businesses. <mark>King Kong</mark> now employs 34 people in its Melbourne office.\" Some failed, some did OK and some I sold, \"he explained. Then, five years ago, he launched digital marketing company <mark>King Kong</mark>. At the time he had just a\" couple of hundred dollars in the bank \"after experiencing years of business ups and downs and having just gotten married.\" I was at ground zero but I had made a commitment to this girl, so it was time to pony up and forge a real business career, \"he said.\" It was the moment I drew a line in the sand - I was literally wondering how I was going to pay rent, so I decided to go back to my roots, making 150 cold calls a day. \"I had no rich uncle, no venture capital or loans or savings, so I had to go out there and make it myself.\" In the beginning, Mr Suby was working 18-hour days doing everything himself from running errands to cleaning the office and bookkeeping. But then he stumbled upon a simple rule that changed everything. It was the \"80-20 rule\" - also known as the Pareto principle. The 34-year-old is now a married father of one. \"The principle is that 20 per cent of the input of anything will give you 80 per cent of the output - so 20 per cent of customers will give 80 per cent of profits, or 20 per cent of the roads in a city will carry 80 per cent of the traffic,\" he said. \"It wasn't until I sat down and had a real audit of my time that I realised what I was doing wasn't sustainable - so I asked myself,\" what are the things I'm doing that are actually moving the money needle and driving the business forward or making more revenue?' So I started to automate or delegate and take the grunt work out of the business. \"That's when things truly\" exploded \".\" It was like a switch - once I made the conscious decision to spend all my time selling, within a couple of days, instead of getting one or two clients a week we were getting four to five. It doubled sales almost overnight, \"he said. Today <mark>King Kong</mark> is valued at $30 million with a three-year growth rate of 314 per cent, has 65 staff members in its shiny new Melbourne office and attracts thousands of new clients each month. Mr Suby, now a 34-year-old father of one, said it was a\" humbling experience \"to have gone from such a modest upbringing to become a multimillion-dollar success story. Sabri Suby says the key to success is to work hard--and work smart.\" The opportunities we have in Australia are incredible - you can come from an unfortunate upbringing with just one parent working three jobs with no money, no private school and no cheque written for uni...and turn yourself into a multimillion-dollar success, \"he said.\" You can go out there with no resources from an unfortunate situation...but when people roll up their sleeves and get the job done it doesn't matter the colour of your skin, where you come from or who your parents are, it evens the playing field. \"Don't wait for somebody to tell you you're worthy of success, just get out there.\" Mr Suby, whose first book, Sell Like Crazy, became a bestseller this year, said the secret to success came down to \"working tirelessly\" - but also working smart. \"Isolate the things you have to do to drive the business forward, and work like a dog on those things. Find the small hinges that swing the big doors,\" he said. Mr Suby's book was released earlier this year. \"One thing that is constant is that the hardest worker in the room will be a success, and my advice is you want to exercise your work ethic like a muscle - you won't make money without hard work.\" More Stories From $7 Pizza Hut wage to $250m empire premium_icon Burger chain's rapid expansion to 50 outlets More Stories From $7 Pizza Hut wage to $250m empire premium_icon Burger chain's rapid expansion to 50 outlets Show More 0 80-20 rule Read More Login to follow australian entrepreneur Read More Login to follow editorship Read More Login to follow entrepreneur Read More Login to follow millionaire Read More Login to follow 80-20 rule australian entrepreneur editorship entrepreneur millionaire"}, {"articleID": "2012072510_00012931_W", "names": {"Mike Holloway": ["Q16226113", "Q20090931"], "Christian Taylor": ["Q1751", "Q5110185", "Q5110187"]}, "date": "2012-07-25", "url": "http://gatorsports.com/article/20120725/articles/120729806", "content": "it's been quite a year for uf track and field coach <mark>mike holloway</mark>. after guiding the gators to their third straight men's ncaa indoor title and first ncaa outdoor crown in 2012, <mark>holloway</mark> is heading across the big pond to london as an assistant coach for the u.s. men's olympic team. \"i've been to the olympics before as a personal coach, but i know this will be different,\" <mark>holloway</mark> said. \"i'm actually a member of the staff, and i'm going to be walking around with\" usa' across my chest every day helping other people try and do their best. \"in addition to being the assistant in charge of sprints and hurdles for the u.s. men, <mark>holloway</mark> is personally coaching a pair of his former uf standouts in tony mcquay (400 meters) and kerron clement (400-meter hurdles).\" i think the thing that happens sometimes is people forget who they are and how they got there, \"<mark>holloway</mark> said.\" as far as tony and kerron go, we're just going to go over there and do what we've been doing all year long. we're going to compete hard, get our rest and just be who we are. \"clement won a silver medal in the 400 hurdles in beijing in 2008.\" i just need to stay focused and keep my eyes on the prize, \"he said.\" i fell a little short in the last olympics and got a silver medal. i'm just hungry to get that gold. \"two more ex-gators, <mark>christian taylor</mark> (triple jump) and will claye (long jump, triple jump), are strong medal contenders for the u.s., with <mark>taylor</mark> the reigning world champ in his specialty.\" they're both \"gamers' as i like to call them,\" <mark>holloway</mark> said. \"when the bright lights come on, those two guys shine their brightest, so i'm not too concerned about those two cats at all.\" a late addition to the u.s. 4x100-meter relay pool, florida sprinter jeff demps received an invitation to london on tuesday when it was announced that mike rodgers would miss the games with a stress fracture in his left foot. former uf olympian tom pukstys (javelin), who is coaching the throws for the u.s. men, joins <mark>holloway</mark> as an assistant, while five other former gators - kemal mesic (bosnia), moise joseph (haiti), genevieve lacaze (australia), shara proctor (great britain) and novlene williams-mills (jamaica) - will compete for their respective countries. \"it really hasn't sunk in yet,\" <mark>holloway</mark> said. \"walking in the stadium for the first race and hearing the starting gun go off, i think that is when it will really hit home.\" again, at the end of the day, and i know it's kind of cliche, but it's just another track meet and i've got to go do my job. that's what it comes down to. \"in addition to the 23 swimmers and ten track and field athletes with uf ties, ex-gators abby wambach and heather mitts (u.s., soccer), lisa raymond (u.s., tennis) and azania stewart (great britain, basketball) will be competing in london. a fifth, melanie booth (canada, soccer), was chosen as an alternate."}, {"articleID": "2017091610_00092224_W", "names": {"Jerry Brown": ["Q152451", "Q717620"], "Brendan O'Brien": ["Q16194729", "Q23091973", "Q4961028", "Q496739", "Q707504"], "Andrew Bolton": ["Q20829853", "Q9151099"]}, "date": "2017-09-16", "url": "http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2017/sep/16/california-lawmakers-take-anti-trump-stance-as-session-ends/", "content": "California lawmakers take anti-Trump stance as session ends Saturday, September 16, 2017 5:42 a.m. CDT U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he arrives at Morristown municipal airport for a weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California lawmakers voted to become a sanctuary state, tussled over hot-button environmental issues and urged other states to refuse to cooperate with President Donald Trump's Election Integrity Commission as their legislative year ended early on Saturday. The majority Democratic lawmakers headed back to their districts having positioned the state in opposition to conservative policies proposed by the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump on immigration, the environment and other issues. \"It's a purposeful positioning,\" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California. \"We have a different political path and a different ideological path than the Republican-controlled Congress and White House have.\" This year, California lawmakers have strengthened protections for undocumented immigrants, increased the gasoline tax and extended a program aimed at compelling businesses to reduce air pollution, all in opposition to federal policies. Early on Saturday, lawmakers gave last-minute support to a bill barring local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail just to allow enforcement officers to take them into their custody. The bill, a compromise from a version that sought to severely restrict interactions between law enforcement and immigration officials, does allow communities to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. It also allows enforcement agents access to local jails. It came a day after a federal judge barred the U.S. Justice Department from denying public-safety grants to so-called sanctuary cities in retaliation for limiting cooperation with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The bill goes now to Democratic Governor <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> for his signature. Trump issued an executive order in January targeting funding for cities that offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. A San Francisco judge blocked the order. Illinois' Republican Governor signed a bill last month protecting people from being detained because they are the subject of an immigration-related warrant. FOSSIL FUELS Although California lawmakers have enacted several environmental protections this year, a measure aimed at weaning the state's power grid entirely off fossil fuels by 2045 died for the year after lawmakers adjourned without voting on it. California's three investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric [SDGE. UL], said the bill does not protect customers from the cost of switching from fossil fuels. Assemblyman Chris Holden, who held the measure in his Utilities and Energy Committee, said he would consider it again when the legislature returns in January for the second half of their two-year session. The legislature also passed a package of bills aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing in the notoriously expensive state, and approved a plan for spending $1.5 billion in income from the state's cap-and-trade air quality program, which raises money by selling businesses limited rights to emit pollutants. They passed a resolution condemning the election integrity commission, calling it an effort to suppress the voting rights of minorities and others, and voted to move up the state's presidential primary from June to March.
