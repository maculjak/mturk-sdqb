i saw sam mendes running up and down the aisles filming the show, and i was hoping that it was this one that was to be released...and it was the whole point of the show to recreate judy's carnegie album...still, both shows were brilliant so it'll all be fantastic as per rufus' usual...to non uk/irish fans...the palladium show was shown on channel 4 recently...i missed it though as i was on holiday...doh! roll on 10th october when i get to see mr w up close again in dublin...faaaaantaaaaastic! if the clip of \"san fransisco\" on youtube is any indication it was a fabulous show and will be equally wonderful on dvd! i can't wait for 1st feb next year for rufus' show in melbourne, but this will help satisfy me for a while! will these be released in australia? or at least will the dvd be multi-region/regionless? i was wondering when something of that sort would come out i can't wait! i almost cried in milwaukee when he did get happy! i said at that moment i was the happiest girl in the world...i love judy garland. i love rufus wainwright. my soul may explode from the beauty of it all! hurray!!! i'm so thrilled! guess what i'm getting as an early christmas present? i'm going to go preorder it right now! i have totally enjoyed his want dvd so am really looking forward to this one! great news - you can see the blog i posted after seeing you in london last month below - unfortunately the photos i took can't be copied here due to html code being disabled. the gay messiah question, - what is the difference between a good and a great concert? for me, a good concert is hearing one of your favourite artistes singing their songs, a great concert is feeling that you've spent 2.5 hours in their company and got to know a bit more about that artist and how they tick, or what their sense of humour is like. rufus wainwright is like a male version of cyndi lauper, in so much as he doesn't shut up when you see him live, he talks between almost every song and he oozes star quality and he is damn funny too. from the moment he bounces on stage and announces in his strong american accent that its \"good to be home\" the audience is in the palm of his hand. he obviously loves london, he tells us how he wants to move here but its too expensive, and he'd need to be a really, really big star and sell thousands and thousands of records to buy a house here, but us coming to see him in concert is one small step in helping him to achieve that goal. he's been touring around the uk for the last month and he says, as good as the audiences have been, he has felt like a big fish in a little town and most people were only there because there wasn't anything else on in town that night to see, in london there's so much happening that he's touched we've come to see him. (these are his words before i get angry comments from the midlands, bronte country or the moors) the show is in two halves, in the first half (stars & stripes outfit - i have pics i'll be adding later) he does nearly all the songs from his latest album, release the stars including tulsa, & sanssouci - plus the art teacher & the song that got me interested in him in the first place cigarettes & chocolate milk (its about the best things being bad for us) this was rufus' introduction to sanssouci, it is a palace in germany built for crown prince frederick, look him up on wikipedia, he ain't pretty - frederick had two rules for sanssouci, it was to be a men only palace and none of the doors were to have locks on them, so that the prince could walk in on his guests as he pleased and order them to do...well, the possibilities are endless really. he introduced tiergarten a beautiful song he'd written about his german boyfriend thus - german rolling stone magazine had an article about musicians and their muses and number one was <mark>john lennon</mark> & <mark>yoko ono</mark>, two was mick jagger & marianne faithful, then at number nine, rufus wainwright and my german boyfriend - the lucky bastard. germany so hard to love, and we hate to love it, its true. on the record between my legs has guest spoken vocals from <mark>sian phillips</mark>, on the tour fans have been asked to submit clips of themselves doing the spoken section to you tube (or was it x tube?) and the best one from each town gets to perform the song on stage with rufus, or as more often is the case, the only entrant from each town. part two of the show had more german references with rufus kitted out in lederhosen (think they're actually from austria) but its very sound of music, part two culminates with ginger dave's fave rufus song 14th street (did think of you dave when it played). rufus then came back in a white toweling dressing gown for an encore of poses before removing the gown to reveal fishnet tights, he proceeded to put on some lippy and high heels for a fabulous and totally camp rendition of judy garland's get happy complete with male dancers [this song alone made it worthwhile for grumpy to have travelled down from birmingham just for the night] before the last song the gay messiah which has one of the best opening lines ever in my opinion, \"he will be re-born, from 1970's porn\" he is a master showman and doesn't just sing his songs, he performs them. he's at hammersmith again tonight and said tomorrow's show will be even better, tonight has been great but the second show is always better - i'm very tempted to find out if that is true. currently listening: want by rufus wainwright waiting for december 4!! also waiting for the sam mendes flick...what's up wuth that one? just going to sit back and let the music make me smile...you're the best, rufus! good luck with the rest of your tour...please come to florida! okay i love rufus and all but i'm starting to wonder if i'll ever be able to relate to his music the way i did with his first couple of albums. as far as this release, i'm not over 60 and i'm not a gay man so i don't appreciate judy the way so many others apparently do. ya she was into gay men - we get it. so now she's an icon/cliche and celebrate the fact she was a negligent mother and serious drug abuser (even if it was pushed on her at first). i still think rufus is a genius but i wish, just once, he would do something a little more mainstream. he's the kind of musician who can do mainstream his own unique way without selling out and fans, both old and new would reward him unlike never before. so even though i love rufus i'm not going to purchase something i know i won't be in to. best of luck with the sales though...i saw you perform this live, you are fabu the show was a riot, you make my heart sing! i'm going to buy it today!!!!!!"}, {"articleID": "2014042305_00054389_W", "names": {"Robin Harris": ["Q21454128", "Q7352456"], "Peter Schmidt": ["Q12331719", "Q1293254", "Q13381961", "Q1665907", "Q2078137", "Q2078139", "Q2078141", "Q2078142", "Q2078146", "Q2078148", "Q27531670", "Q2913063", "Q30066237", "Q47452555", "Q52829079", "Q55741220", "Q57631064", "Q87690"]}, "date": "2014-04-22", "url": "http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20140422/news/140429924", "content": "SEC Commissioner Mike Slive: Leagues, union advocates have common ground Supreme Court upholds Michigan ban on using race as factor in college admissions Indiana Gov.

(AP)--The school that once produced <mark>Chris Canty</mark> and Thorpe Award winner Terence Newman has struggled to defend in recent years in the pass-happy Big 12. It still draws Kansas State coach <mark>Bill Snyder</mark>'s ire. The hard-to-please Hall of Fame coach was often quick to bemoan a bunch that allowed 272.7 yards per game through the air last season, better only than the sieve known as Texas Tech. Their shortcomings were only made worse when they were forced to stand beside by the Wildcats' staunch rush defense, which was by far the best in the Big 12. But the Wildcats harbor hope for success this season. They return D.J. Reed, the league's defensive newcomer of the year, and running mate Duke Shelley at cornerback. Two-year starter Kendall Adams is back to anchor the safety corps, while a host of experience headlined by Cre Moore, Sean Newlan and Denzel Goolsby provide plenty of depth. Throw into the mix Elijah Walker, the third-ranked junior college safety last season, and some think Kansas State could have the best secondary in the Big 12--perhaps even the nation. \"I've seen it all happen, the good and the bad,\" said Shelley, who burned his redshirt as a freshman in 2015 when injuries forced him onto the field. \"Really for us as a unit as well, we went from nobody respecting us to,\" Wow, our unit is getting some love and respect we deserve .' We knew we deserved it. \"Now it's time to keep it. Things started promisingly enough for Kansas State last season, holding Stanford in check in the opener on the road and shutting down Florida Atlantic and Missouri State. But concerns arose when Skylar Howard threw for 298 yards in West Virginia's comeback victory, and they had a full-scale problem the following two games against Texas Tech and Oklahoma. First-round draft pick <mark>Patrick Mahomes</mark> II torched the Wildcats for 504 yards and two touchdowns, while the Sooners' Baker Mayfield had 346 yards and four TDs passing in a 38-17 rout. The key is to prevent a similar downturn this season.\" When you have a decent number of returning starters and returning players, the general public will probably say if you have a lot of people coming back then you will have an even better football team, \"<mark>Snyder</mark> said.\" We were pretty decent at the end of the season last year, so there is great expectation. \"There is nothing wrong with that. That is great,\" he continued. \"The key element is you have to do something about it. You just can't be a returning starter or guy that played an awful lot and the same coaches coming back, etcetera. You have heard me say so many times, every season presents new dynamics.\" One of those dynamics is the schedule. Kansas State opens Sept. 2 against Central Arkansas, then plays Charlotte the following week. It gives the secondary ample opportunity to come together before a trip to Vanderbilt. But the Commodores are no real threat through the air, ranking 100th out of 128 teams in passing offense a year ago. Throw in a week off after the nonconference schedule and the Wildcats should have hit their stride before the Big 12 slate opens with games against Baylor, Texas and TCU. High-powered Oklahoma looms Oct. 21 in a game that could help decide the conference race. \"As long as they keep working, having daily improvement, stay together, play together, we will find replacements for those five or six guys we lost,\" Kansas State defensive coordinator <mark>Tom Hayes</mark> said not only of his secondary but the entire unit. \"It's our job as coaches to identify them and certainly the players' job to go earn them.\" ___ More AP college football: http: //collegefootball.ap.org and https: //twitter.com/AP_Top25 Like this: Like Loading...Related Related Posts Kansas State and Kansas football both land players on preseason watch lists Jesse Ertz receives two more honors heading into 2017 <mark>Bruce Weber</mark> and Kansas State agree on two-year contract extension <mark>Snyder</mark>, Ertz could give K-State another winning combo Advertisement"}, {"articleID": "2018062020_00164441_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2018-06-20", "url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/jews-separated-from-families-during-holocaust-condemn-us-border-policy/", "content": "home page JTA--A group representing children hidden during the Holocaust slammed the US border policy of separating families seeking asylum. \"Separation of the family for us is probably the worst thing that ever happened to us,\" said Rachelle Goldstein, who was separated from her parents in Belgium when she wasn't even 3 years old. Goldstein, the co-director of the Hidden Child Foundation, and her husband, Jack, who also was separated from his parents as a child, appear in a video released Tuesday by the Anti-Defamation League. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up The <mark>Trump</mark> administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the southern US border has drawn criticism this week from across the political spectrum. More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents, according to The New York Times. \"When you take a child away from the parents, from the home, from everything that they know, they are never the same,\" Goldstein said in the video, adding that many children separated from their parents during the Holocaust had still not overcome the trauma. \"Most hidden children are now in their late 70s, 80s, some are even 90, and they still think about it, and it still hurts, it still aches,\" she said. A boy from Honduras is shown being taken into custody by US Border Patrol agents near the US-Mexico Border near Mission, Texas, on June 12, 2018. (John Moore/Getty Images via JTA) The new policy dictates that every migrant who crosses the United States border illegally will be prosecuted and detained. Since children cannot be prosecuted with adults, they are reclassified as unaccompanied minors and taken away. <mark>Trump</mark> administration officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, say it's a necessary measure to enforce border security. Since many of the migrants have ended up in detention centers and temporary shelters, some have compared the policy to Nazi-era actions. Sessions on Tuesday called those comparisons exaggerated. A broad spectrum of Jewish groups have spoken out against the policy, along with many other religious organizations. \"It's wrong, it's wrong,\" Goldstein said. \"How can this happen in the 21st century?\" read more: Jewish Times ADL Anti-Defamation League Holocaust immigration policy Holocaust survivors <mark>Donald Trump</mark> asylum seekers United States Facebook Twitter email Print 0 shares comments"}, {"articleID": "2008121221_00016128_W", "names": {"James Bond": ["Q18377890", "Q24247087", "Q56707370", "Q6129965"]}, "date": "2008-12-12", "url": "http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=61060408&blogID=455893960", "content": "animated 1. bo makes lists...i wannamake one too 2. i hate self centered people 3. \"yeah she's a hardcore bitch with bad shoes\" 4. \"what the hell is post harcore metal?\" 5. why does she talk so much? 6. asshole father 7. friends mia 8. breakfast at night...in the monring...2. am 9. i need a hug. 10. i need a life. 11. comp paper...complete. 12. finals are a joke...heritage is passing everyone this year. 13. dropouts are lame. 14. it's only ghetto if the trailer floods. 15. sometimes ignorance really is bliss. 16. 15 is a lie...i hate people who don't get it. 17. \"truth be told i miss you, truth be told i'm lying\" 18. i actually really do like my job. 19. college scares me. 20. you should change your name to fake instead of...21. rude people should die. 22. my coffee is cold...ewe. 23. i wish people wouldn't write me off as a bitch before they know me. 24. i wish more people would talk to me. 25. i miss bo. 26. i miss brianna. 27. i miss sarah. 28. i miss mary. 29. i miss kelsey and josh. 30. i miss last year. 31. summer can't come quick enough. 32. krispy kreme has better coffee than starbucks...but krispy kreme doesn't have lattes...aint that a bitch. 33. i just microwaved my coffee 34. this is kind of pointless. 35. too bad i'm too bored to care. 36. if coffee is an addiction i'm not sure i would go to rehab. 37. i love christmas. 38. i love cold weather more than i love warm weather. 39. my feet are cold. 40. high school relationships are stupid. 41. you can't always get what you want...is playing 42. my favorite twilight character besides the obvious is jasper. mostly because he has a cool name...and while playing disney trivia with amanda the answer is always jasper...or 42. 43. the irony of the above statement since it was not planned. 44. i still hate a certain someone...because i fell so hard...and you didn't care. 45. i think a certain level of maturity should be tested before people can graduate high school. 46. there is a difference between cute immaturity and falt out annoying immaturity. 47. i wish i had the patience people seem to think i have. 48. i kind of wish i had diana's confrontational side. there are some bitches i'd love to call out. 49. i miss diana and lindsay. 50. i need a new car. 51. maybe tina will give me more hours so i can get a new car. 52. maybe an suv will fall from the sky with a note that says merry christmas hayley! 53. my imagination gets out of hand sometimes. 54. next semesters gonna be a breeze. 55. i secretly want to be the first one to take off at the red light. 56. i deny it every time though. 57. if i ever direct a movie...johnny depp will be my leading man...even if he's 80 in a wheelchair and balding. 58. mafia...wtf...59. add. most definately. 60. my spelling abilities suck just about as much as......'s personality.

(WPMI) A A MOBILE, Ala. (WPMI)--President Trump was highly critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a New York Times interview Wednesday, saying he would not have picked Sessions as his Attorney General. \"Sessions never should've recused himself. He should've told me before he took the job, and I would've picked somebody else.\" Trump said it was \"unfair\" for Sessions to rescue himself from the Russia investigation, which led to special counsel being appointed. In a news conference this morning, Sessions said he's staying put. . \"I have the honor of serving as Attorney General. We love this job. We love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate,\" said Sessions. \"For Trump to turn around and stab Sessions in the back like this unconscionable,\" said conservative columnist Quin Hillyer. Sessions was the first U.S. Senator to support Trump during the campaign and remained loyal throughout. The President's remarks rebuked by conservatives in Sessions home state, where he remains a popular figure. \"If Trump fires Jeff Sessions, then that means the only person left who Trump will not show loyalty to is Vladimir Putin,\" said Hillyer. The phone lines also lighting up on local conservative talk radio. \"Trump shouldn't have thrown him under the bus.\" said a caller on FM Talk 106.5 Midday Mobile. \"You're telling me the recusal, which was the right thing to do, brought the problem? Come on, give me a break!\" said host <mark>Sean Sullivan</mark>. In the special election to fill Sessions seat, Republicans have aligned themselves with Trump, some attacking each other for not being loyal enough. Rep. Mo Brooks, who has been on the receiving end of those attack ads said today, he understands President Trump's position but says Sessions \"did the right thing\" and is \"a person of the highest caliber.\" close"}, {"articleID": "2017111614_00955849_W", "names": {"John Gruden": ["Q365882", "Q6379151"], "Scott Frost": ["Q2018023", "Q7436370"], "Aaron Hayden": ["Q20807778", "Q4662083"], "John Currie": ["Q16241256", "Q43910622", "Q6227942", "Q6227944"]}, "date": "2017-11-16", "url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/football/2017/11/16/grumor-mill-full-swing-jon-gruden-ut-vols-coaching-search-unfolds/868121001/", "content": "Share This Story!

Miami Marlins ace <mark>Jose Fernandez</mark> could become the 18th player this season--17 are pitchers--requiring reconstruction of his elbow because of a tear in the ulnar collateral ligament. The Yankees' Ivan Nova recently had the procedure and Mets righthander <mark>Matt Harvey</mark> is recovering from the surgery performed last November. \"It's certainly something that is happening with increasing frequency and [has] much more focus on it by clubs, media, fans,\" said a participant at the quarterly meetings at MLB headquarters in Manhattan. \"How this impacts drafts, signings, use of pitchers in player development and major leagues are issues every club now looks at differently than in the past.\" <mark>Green</mark>, an internist at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, said, \"This has been a research priority for us. We certainly recognize that something is happening to a quarter of our pitchers. It's something that we've had our attention on for several years. And we're actively researching this and we're going to continue doing that regardless of whether or not this is a spike this year.\" It's clearly a problem. This is a research priority and the commissioner has talked to me and conveyed his concern. And they said whatever resources you need to bring for people to bring in to look at this, you have whatever you need. \"There is a theory that the damage is the result of over-usage and that it largely affects hard throwers.\" It's a little premature, but overall I would probably agree with that, \"<mark>Green</mark> said.\" That's why we are researching this because we don't have a good answer. The thing that I would caution against is that while everybody maybe has a torn ligament, how they get there may differ. We may be saying the ulnar collateral tear is [the] end point--it could be from multiple problems. \"Joe Torre, MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations, believes the problem lies beyond merely saying it is endemic to power pitchers.\" Tommy John didn't throw hard, \"he said of the first pitcher to have the surgery in 1974. <mark>Green</mark> said,\" Even though we know that there are now more pitchers throwing at a higher velocity that they used to, that could be an association, not a causation. That's why we're doing research to find the causation rather than just things that could be associated with it. Everyone can speculate. Until we get some better answers, everybody has different opinions. \"<mark>Green</mark> could not put a time frame on finding a solution, saying,\" I've been asked that a lot. That's not how research works. You can have a breakthrough and then you find something and sometimes that raises three more questions. I really couldn't put a timetable on it. I would love to be able to, but you have complex problems that have complex answers. \""}]
