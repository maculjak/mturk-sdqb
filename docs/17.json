10-year plan, victoria will also appoint a chief child psychiatrist, a first for australia, and set up a $1.8 million program to help families traumatised by the bushfires. a youth mental health expert welcomed the strategy as potentially the biggest step forward since the kennett government scrapped asylums, but warned that the rest of the plan must be put into effect urgently or victoria could miss treating a young \"potential <mark>martin bryant</mark>\" (the port arthur gunman). premier john brumby said it was not financially possible to reform the whole mental health system straight away. the first step will be two pilot projects, one in the grampians and one in melbourne's south, that will send mental health workers into the community to spot early signs of mental illness and guide young people to help. the workers will go into schools, kindergartens, youth centres, gp clinics, hospitals and housing support services in order to make mental health services more accessible. \"one of the key challenges we've got is moving into this space earlier, tackling these issues earlier and focusing more on child and adolescent mental health issues,\" mr brumby said. \"some of the problems, like bipolar (disorder) and schizophrenia, often emerge in late adolescence, and if you are able to tackle those things early, it can just make a fundamental difference to people in later life .\" the strategy paper also incorporates a program called renew, under which experts in post-traumatic stress disorder will work with bushfire victims. the government will appoint

"16/03/2009 - 14:06:09 shirts worn by defenders who were tormented by george best are among rare items for sale in an auction of memorabilia owned by the family of the late footballing legend this week. a miniature replica of the european cup commemorating the manchester united star's goal in the 1968 final triumph against benfica will also be going under the hammer in belfast. the 110-lot collection, which is expected to fetch up to \u00a3 100,000 (\u20ac 108,000), belonged to best's father dickie, who died last year aged 88. other notable collector pieces on offer at wilsons auction house on thursday night include a letter opener presented to the forward to mark his two goals in another stunning victory over benfica, this time two years before the european cup final. best's two goals in portugal that night in 1966 earned him the nickname \"el beatle\". framed photographs signed by best's contemporaries at old trafford, including legendary manager matt busby, are also in the catalogue, as is a cine camera given to the star by his old team in belfast, cregagh boy club, when he joined united. this lot is accompanied by a photograph of george being presented with the gift in 1963 alongside his mother and father. the collection also holds recent items, including a framed copy of the order of service from the star's funeral in belfast in 2005. dickie best stipulated in his will that both the family home at 16 burren way in the cregagh estate and its contents were sold upon his death. <mark>richard bell</mark> from wilsons auctioneers said it was huge honour to have been asked to conduct the sale. \"george best is an iconic figure and perhaps the most talented and charismatic sportsman to come from northern ireland,\" he said, revealing that the auction has already attracted interest from around the world. \"i had an email this morning from san diego from a gentleman who had found out about the sale and he's interested in two or three different items,\" he added. \"we would expect that, obviously there's a big connection with northern ireland football and man united football. i mean it's just phenomenal the number of fans he had .\" among the shirts for sale are ones george swapped with international opponents while playing for northern ireland. the england, scotland, holland and switzerland jerseys are all framed and signed by best. \"they have attracted quite a bit of interest and we would expect that there would be a lot of people wanting to own those,\" said mr <mark>bell</mark>. while reluctant to indulge in too much speculation on possible prices, the auctioneer said he was confident the economic downturn would not have a negative impact. \"i think and i hope there will be items here for everybody to get a chance to buy and i hope there will be a few gasps from the audience,\" he said. \"but how do we put a value on items that once belonged or were handed to other people by george best?\" he was undoubtedly one of the most iconic sportsmen every to come from northern ireland so that's going to make the difference between what's a good price and an absolutely phenomenal price. \"how or when are you ever going to get the opportunity again to own something from this particular collection and that's what makes it so exciting for us as auctioneers .\" ", "articleID": "2009031614_00045873_W", "names": {"Richard Bell":

fanning, packers.com posted 08/14/2008 brian brohm will once again be the second quarterback to enter the game again this week when the packers travel to san francisco, but fellow rookie <mark>matt flynn</mark>'s strong play of late has put him in position to compete for the backup quarterback job behind aaron rodgers. even though brohm was a second-round pick and <mark>flynn</mark> was selected in the seventh round of the 2008 nfl draft, head coach <mark>mike mccarthy</mark> said <mark>flynn</mark> is in the mix for the no. 2 job. \"i think <mark>matt</mark>'s definitely closing the gap, there's no doubt about it,\" <mark>mccarthy</mark> said. \"i think he's really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days .\" i think <mark>matt</mark> is getting more comfortable. brian was more comfortable quicker in the earlier part as far as the otas, understanding what we're doing. i think they're both good young prospects. \"neither player put up numbers that jumped off the stat sheet on monday night, but <mark>mccarthy</mark> said both brohm and <mark>flynn</mark> showed some signs of progress .\" just looking at their grades, they did a number of positive things in the game, \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said .\" they did not have winning performances is the way we look at it, and it's just a number of things we need to clean up. \"i've said it time and time again; (those) guys need to play. we knew this was going to take probably the full preseason to get those two guys ready, and we feel like we're on course to get that done .\" <mark>flynn</mark> entered monday night's game with a 5:27 to go in the third quarter and played five series, and finished the night 12-of-21 for 97 yards and a touchdown. with the packers trailing 20-10 with a little over six minutes remaining in the game, <mark>flynn</mark> led the offense on a 12-play, 62-yard drive that was capped off with an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back kregg lumpkin. <mark>flynn</mark>'s debut included some rough moments, beginning with a sack on his very first play, which he said could have been avoided. \"the things that always stick out in my mind are mistakes,\" <mark>flynn</mark> said. \"i could have made a couple of adjustments on protections. that would have helped out and not got me sacked on the first play. just the little things, reads, being quicker with decisions and things like that .\" despite entering camp as the third quarterback as a late-round pick, <mark>flynn</mark> said his focus has remained on getting better each practice and learning the offense. \"i really don't assume anything,\" <mark>flynn</mark> said. \"i came in here and i didn't really know what the situation was going to be or what it's going to be like at the end of camp. it's one of those things that i am going to go out and play as hard as i can and just let the coaches do their job .\" i look at it like i have an opportunity to come in here and learn how to play the game, learn from some great coaches, learn from aaron, and do the best i can and take advantage of the opportunity. \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said earlier during camp that brohm has picked up the mental aspect of the game better than any other young quarterback that he has worked with, but against the bengals, brohm wasn't able to put any points on the board monday night in his five series directing the offense. brohm's evening got off to an inauspicious start as well, as he threw an interception on his very first play on as pass intended for wide receiver <mark>james jones</mark>. he finished the night 8-of-17 for 70 yards, but did make a nice throw at the end of the first half when he hooked up with fellow rookie jordy nelson for a 22-yard gain .\" overall i felt like i did a pretty good job of just the mechanics of the offense, getting in and out of the huddle, \"brohm said after the game on monday night .\" most of the time i felt like i went to the right place with the ball. obviously there were a few times where i made mistakes and went to the wrong place, forced one in there on the first play. \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said the quarterback rotation will remain the same at san francisco on saturday night, and that as of now the number of repetitions that brohm and <mark>flynn</mark> will each receive will stay the same as well .\" we've kept them the same, as far as going through the installation phase, \"<mark>mccarthy</mark> said .\" brian took the reps of the no. 2 and <mark>matt</mark> took the reps of the no. 3. based on the period, 3-2-1 is the ratio, sometimes it was 4-2-1 as far as the starter. now, once we got into this in-season schedule, they split the opponent reps, and brian is still getting a little more work than <mark>matt</mark>. \"on wednesday, general manager ted thompson said even though it is unusual to have two rookies backing up the starter at quarterback, the team is pleased with the tandem's development up to this point .\" i don't know if you drew it up like this is the way you would do it, but this is the way it is, \"thompson said .\" we like our two young guys, and we think they are on a steady path here. quite frankly, our coaching staff likes working with them, so we feel pretty good. \"despite the inexperience at the position, thompson added that the team won't close the door on the possibility of bringing in a veteran at the position, but that it isn't more of a priority than any other spot on the roster. this makes me sad i hope broum gets a better feel for the game thats who i want to see backing up rogers", "articleID": "2009031702_00048794_W", "names": {"James Jones": ["Q14950321", "Q16467448", "Q1681147", "Q16973415", "Q18637520", "Q18671594",
