watson</mark> danced what he called \"a scottish jig\" on the 18th green after another long putt fell into the cup. play on. about an hour later, tiger woods tapped in for a par that didn't mean a thing. time to call it a day. talk about role reversal. <mark>watson</mark>, the 59-year-old former british open champion, was supposed to be going through the motions, taking his penultimate curtain call at a tournament that holds such a special place in his career. instead, he heads to the weekend with a share of the lead, having put together two magical rounds and needing two more to get his hands on the claret jug for a record-tying sixth time. woods, the world's best player and right in his prime, was supposed to be homing in on a 15th major championship, another step closer to jack nicklaus' record 18. instead, woods missed the cut, hopped his private jet to florida, and gave his personal chef a few unexpected days off. these were two turnberry shockers. \"it's as if the spirits are on my side,\" said <mark>watson</mark>, who made history friday afternoon as the oldest player to lead a major championship, tying open rookie <mark>steve marino</mark> with a 5-under 135. woods must have felt like everything was stacked against him, because he's sure not used to failing. this was only the second time in 49 major championships as a pro that he failed to make it to the weekend. \"kept making mistake after mistake,\" woods said. now comes a weekend alive with possibilities, just none of them involving woods. the early starters saturday played in pleasant, partly cloudy weather, though that persistent breeze along the scottish coast toughened things up. just ask two-time champion padraig harrington, whose hopes of winning a third straight open faded away with a 6-over score through 16 holes. but american bryce moulder showed a low number was possible, posting an early 3-under 67. <mark>watson</mark> will take aim at harry vardon and his six british open titles. one shot behind was 49-year-old mark calcavecchia, who won the open 20 years ago up the coast at royal troon. he, too, survived the stretch of holes along the firth of clyde in a stiff wind that demanded so much of every shot. calcavecchia made a 40-foot birdie putt on the 10th that carried him to a 69. two-time u.s. open champion retief goosen twice saved par from 35 feet and had a 70, putting him in the group at 3-under 137 that included three-time major champion <mark>vijay singh</mark>. thirteen players were within three shots of the lead, while <mark>sergio garcia</mark> (139) and <mark>john daly</mark> (140) were both in striking distance. \"i guess the memories are with me, all the wonderful memories i've had playing links golf,\" <mark>watson</mark> said. \"walking down the fairways, walking up onto the greens, people showing their respect for me, showing my respect for them. and it's been since 1975-34 years i've played links golf. and it's a fabric of my life, i can tell you that .\" woods failed to make the cut for only the sixth time in his career, and the first since the 2006 u.s. open at winged foot, his first tournament after his father died. \"everybody's entitled to a bad day,\" said lee westwood, who played with woods and shot 70 to join the group at 138. \"it was tough conditions out there, and the wind can play havoc with your swing sometimes. and he hit a couple of poor shots at the wrong time .\" <mark>watson</mark> finished with a pair of birdie putts that were nearly as long as his odds of winning another claret jug. there was a 75-footer footer from the back on the 16th green, then a 45-footer at no. 18 to cap an even-par 70 that might have been more impressive than his bogey-free 65 on thursday. this time, he had to bounce back after making five bogeys in six holes, four of them in a row. \"i wouldn't be here if i didn't think i could win,\" <mark>watson</mark> said. woods always thinks he can win, but his performance on the back nine was abysmal. he hit one tee shot that was never found in the high grass along the dunes right of the 10th fairway. he hit into a fairway bunker for the first time all week. it took him two shots to get up a bank and onto the green at the 13th. woods dropped seven shots during a wretched six-hole stretch, and not even two late birdies could spare him the indignation of missing the cut. needing to chip in for birdie on the 18th hole, he came up a few feet short and tapped in for a 74 and 145 total, one shot off the cut. \"i kept compounding my problems out there,\" woods said. <mark>watson</mark> was tied for the lead with <mark>marino</mark>, a 29-year-old american who didn't know until last weekend that he had gotten into the british open as an alternate, and then had to fly his father from virginia to his home in florida to fetch <mark>marino</mark>'s passport. \"i wasn't even expecting to play in this tournament,\" <mark>marino</mark> said. one year after greg norman made a stunning bid to win the british open at 53, the prospects of <mark>watson</mark> winning at 59 are staggering. the oldest major champion was julius boros, who was 48 when he captured the 1968 pga championship. <mark>watson</mark> won his first of his five british opens at carnoustie in 1975, five months before woods was born. now <mark>watson</mark> is trying to win another-and he doesn't have to worry about woods getting in the way. ann coulter on top victim status: \"being black trumps being an insect' to liberals", "articleID":

warlocks fail to live up to its impressive pedigree on its fifth proper album, the mirror explodes, a dim facsimile of its heroes' brilliance. since forming in los angeles in 1999, the warlocks have persisted long enough to see the success of several bands doing the same dreamy, fuzz-rock shtick (most notably the black angels and the raveonettes) without finding much success. perhaps bobby

bolster regard for tee pee records, former home of the band's old buddies brian jonestown massacre. since signing to tee pee, the warlocks have altered its sound slightly, abandoning the straight side two of white light/white heat homage that characterized its early material in favor of a lateral move into shoegaze. the mirror explodes finds bobby hecksher fronting an entirely new cast of sidemen through a wholly monochromatic set of eight fuzzy, reverb-drenched and indistinguishable tunes. like kevin shields, hecksher keeps his vocals soft and distant, just another instrument meant to mesh with the white noise of the warlocks' three-guitar assault. the lyrics are mostly indistinguishable, save a fleeting reference to a hospital on \"red camera\" and oblique statements of alienation and misery on \"there is a formula to your despair\" , all in keeping with the group's druggy persona and the oppressively dreary soundscapes. the songs have no peaks or valleys, just a constant drone that eventually yields to the next track without fanfare. everything is at the same dirge-like tempo, making the record seem to be one extended, formless jam. when the vocals drop out completely for an instrumental showcase on \"frequency meltdown\" , the band neglects to alter its formula, stubbornly soldiering on with the same pointless meandering. thankfully, the band refrains from the extended jams that showed up on their previous albums, never making any cut last much over six minutes, arbitrarily ending most around the five-minute mark. such apparently amorphous monotony would be

mcclendon, 27, of greeley will resume this morning with closing arguments in weld district court. the final day of an emotional rape trial almost ended in mistrial thursday morning when weld county sheriff's deputies arrested a woman in court after learning she was wanted in arizona for failing to appear to testify in a murder trial. the rape trial of joseph mcclendon, 27, was near its end thursday in weld district court when deputies moved to quietly arrest a woman who was there with mcclendon's family and who also was directly involved in the case. deputies arrested felicia simmons, a key witness against a man accused of murder in arizona. simmons failed to show up to testify in june. \"she is an essential witness as to this murder,\" said mark diebolt, a deputy pima county attorney in arizona who is prosecuting the case of simmons' ex-boyfriend. he is accused of murdering another woman in january 2008. diebolt said his office is trying to extradite simmons back to arizona. simmons' arrest, however, was preceded by an outburst from mcclendon's brother-in-law when mcclendon's sister was mistaken for simmons. the outburst, which included expletives, the appearance of four sheriff deputies and a family member of the alleged rape victim crying and saying she was afraid before being escorted out of the courtroom, all occurred in front of the 13-person jury that has been hearing the case against mcclendon. several jury members said they were concerned that mcclendon's family knew their names. mcclendon has been accused of entering an 18-year-old woman's apartment in the middle of the night in january and raping her three times before she stabbed him with scissors and fled. mcclendon has said the sex between them was consensual, and he testified to that effect thursday afternoon. simmons, the woman arrested in court thursday, was initially contacted by greeley police after they discovered a trail of blood leading to her apartment from the alleged victim's apartment. she initially refused to let investigators in, and they got a warrant to search. inside, they found mcclendon hiding under a pile of clothes in a closet. simmons' reluctance may have been explained by her involvement in the arizona case. initially not cooperative, she had been granted limited immunity in the case against the murder of a romantic rival, angela gayden. <mark>eric hill</mark> is awaiting trial in pima county, where he's been charged with first-degree murder. diebolt said he granted simmons limited immunity if she would lead them to the body. \"we had to grant her limited immunity as to her burying the body. she participated in that part. she rolled up the body in carpet, helped transport the body and drove with the murderer to the desert,\" diebolt said. \"we granted her limited immunity as to that aspect if she would tell us where the body was .\" she left town before divulging the body's location, which police found anyway, diebolt said. \"right before the trial started, her rights were severed as to the children, and she took off,\" diebolt said. without her testimony, diebolt said he didn't have a trial. \"she's been a real thorn in my side .\" the morning outburst in the mcclendon trial in greeley, though, prompted public defender stephanie stout to ask for a mistrial because it would have been prejudicial to mcclendon, especially if jurors were afraid of his family. she indicated there would be strong grounds for an appeal if the jury came back with a conviction because they had witnessed the outburst. chief deputy district attorney steve wrenn said it's not uncommon for jurors to worry about their roles. \"that's the nature of the beast,\" wrenn said. \"the remedy is not to start over from scratch and do it all over again .\" ", "articleID": "2009072407_00028537_W", "names": {"Eric Hill": ["Q12714522", "Q21458196", "Q2901293", "Q5386728", "Q5386729"]}}, {"date": "2009-07-24", "url":

months after barack obama's inauguration, a persistent and noisy legion of doubters won't let go of an already debunked claim - that he is actually a foreign-born, illegal president. the issue has flared again on political blogs, tv news shows and even a town hall meeting, widely circulated on youtube, in which a republican congressman was booed for saying obama is a citizen. mainstream republicans who want the issue to go away are having a tough time stamping it out as the so-called \"birthers\" resurface, with assists from talk show host rush limbaugh and cnn's lou dobbs. some who had initially dismissed the claim as a laughable political sideshow now wonder whether it's gotten out of control. \"i've stopped laughing,\" new york daily news columnist errol louis wrote thursday. \"too many political and media leaders are deliberately fanning the flames of ignorance and fear, and they should be ashamed .\" passions among the birthers run so high that rep. mike castle, of delaware, was booed by his own constituents at a recent town hall meeting for saying obama \"is a citizen of the united states .\" he was responding to a woman who waved her own birth certificate, contended obama was born in kenya, and shouted out, \"i want my country back!\" theories that obama was born abroad abounded during the presidential campaign, even after an official hawaii birth certificate was produced, along with august 1961 birth notices from two honolulu newspapers. numerous lawsuits and emergency appeals were lodged challenging obama's eligibility to be president, and all were rebuffed. the constitution states that a person must be a \"natural-born citizen\" to be eligible for the presidency. the birthers contend that obama's hawaiian birth certificate is a fake, and many say he was actually born in kenya, his father's homeland. limbaugh, for example, joked that obama and god have something in common - the lack of a birth certificate. dobbs has broached the issue several times, saying at one point, \"the questions won't go away .\" and 10 republican members of congress have co-sponsored a bill that would require future presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate. one of those congressmen, <mark>john campbell</mark> of california, was pressed by msnbc's <mark>chris matthews</mark> as to whether he believed obama was a u.s. citizen. \"as far as i know,\" <mark>campbell</mark> replied. the issue also was raised by cnn's <mark>larry king</mark> this week, in a conversation with liz cheney, a former state department official and daughter of former vice president dick cheney. \"i think the democrats have got more crazies than the republicans do,\" liz cheney said. \"but setting that aside, one of the reasons you see people so concerned about this...people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, i think, a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas .\" a fellow guest, democratic strategist james carville, suggested cheney should have been more critical of those questioning obama's citizenship. \"she refuses to say this is ludicrous because she wants these people to believe this,\" he said. carville is among many democratic commentators suggesting that republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base. even some conservatives say dragging out the controversy only hurts the republican cause and helps obama. \"he has a significant number of conservatives wasting enormous amounts of time on a side issue that can never bear any fruit and, as an added bonus, it makes them look somewhat unhinged to many americans,\" wrote conservative blogger <mark>john hawkins</mark> on townhall.com. \"when your political enemies are making fools of themselves, why stop them?\" john feehery, a gop consultant and former press secretary for dennis hastert when he was house speaker, suggested that dobbs and other broadcast figures were seeking to capitalize on the controversy to boost ratings. \"it says more about the media culture we're entering and the decline of responsible journalism, and less about the political realm,\" feehery said. as for the birth certificate bill introduced by the 10 house republicans, feehery said, \"it's so they can point to something if they're asked questions .\" the president's birthplace and citizenship have been among the most popular topics in e-mails to ask ap, a q & a column where associated press journalists respond to readers' questions about the news. over the past year, dozens of readers have asked about obama's birth certificate, or have simply declared that he was born in kenya and asked why he's allowed to serve as president. seemingly unimpeachable evidence hasn't swayed the birthers, as msnbc's conservative talk show host <mark>joe scarborough</mark> noted this week. \"they would rather be like sea lions barking at waves,\" he said. \"instead of trying to figure out what's happening to their country...they embrace conspiracy theories, and they make themselves look like cartoon characters .\" comments from unverified
