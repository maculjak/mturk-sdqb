A series of farm business events in Western Australia in February will include a pragmatic focus on the area of farm labour arrangements--including compliance, risks and recommended actions. Pacer Legal director <mark>Stephen Park</mark> will be one of the presenters at Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) Farm Business Updates in Tambellup on February 12, Lake Grace on February 13 and Moora on February 14. These events are designed to enhance grower and adviser knowledge of farm business issues, to help with effective planning and management. Mr <mark>Park</mark> will address the topic of \"Employing farm labour--practices, compliance and minimising risks' at each of the three Updates, where he will stress the need for proper planning and documentation by employers, as well as knowing your obligations and complying with them. He says farm business employers are expected to maintain and manage employment relationships in accordance with their statutory obligations.\" In this regard, they can be expected to be held to a high standard as they are expected to have the resources, as a reasonably sized enterprise, to ensure compliancy with statutory obligations. Ignorance will not be excused, \"he said.

To minimise these risks, Mr <mark>Park</mark> encourages farm business employers to: Know and comply with their employment obligations Have a concise set of employment practices and procedures Maintain a comprehensive set of employment records for seven years. He will delve deeper into the topic, including a \"drill down' session using a grower case study example, at the Update events. Areas covered will include how to identify the jurisdiction under which to engage employees, and unfair dismissal claims.

Their father was bound, beaten and stabbed to death in his Sydney home during a robbery gone wrong. More than 30 years later, a \"never-ending nightmare\" of thoughts about Charles Skarratt's killing continues to haunt the bookmaker's children. Terry <mark>John Gordon</mark> Hickson, 60, was in December found guilty of the brutal murder of the wealthy bookie after a day at the Dapto greyhound races in 1989. Peter Skarratt and Victoria Frerer choked up as they told the NSW Supreme Court about the impact of their father's death. \"Like a never-ending nightmare, thoughts of how he died will never go away,\" Peter Skarratt said at Hickson's sentencing hearing on Friday. He said his father's ordeal \"over a few dollars\" was beyond his comprehension. \"What is truly horrifying are the thoughts I have of what it must have been like for dad being left to die without the ability to move, care for himself or seek help,\" he said. \"I do not know a life without these...thoughts.\" Mr Skarratt's wife found his body surrounded by blood on the garage floor of his Woolwich home in December 1989. Her victim impact statement was handed to the judge but not read to the court. Ms Frerer told the court she remembered her father as a shy, intelligent and proud man. \"The violent way his life ended - tortured, taped, gagged, stabbed and alone - just breaks my heart,\" she said. \"I have never felt anger, however there is a sadness that visits me every day.\" Hickson's defence barrister argued the judge should sentence his client on the basis Mr Skarratt died during the course of the armed robbery, not because Hickson intended to kill him. Philip Young SC rejected the Crown's claim Mr Skarratt was tortured, saying he was seriously injured in a violent scuffle with Hickson and then bound and gagged. But crown prosecutor Craig Everson argued multiple stab wounds - one ferocious enough to fracture the victim's ribs - showed Hickson intended to do more than stop Mr Skarratt's resistance. \"If his intention was not to kill, it is just outrageous that he didn't do anything to summon some assistance,\" he told the court. Justice <mark>David Davies</mark> was also asked to consider Hickson's extensive criminal history and ill health in his sentencing.

REUTERS/Lucas Jac By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. Federal Reserve rolls out trillions of dollars to blunt the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, there's a notable difference to the last financial crisis: close to zero concern over \"moral hazard\" - the sticky business of bailing out those whose dilemma is of their own making. That's freed up the U.S. central bank to do more, and faster, than it dared to do a decade ago, when it was last called on to launch emergency moves to help protect the economy. Back in 2007-2009, policymakers voiced repeated concern that bailing out banks and financial markets more generally would reward them for having taken imprudent risks. The Fed also faced a political backlash from its congressional overseers for what some saw as extending its reach into the fiscal sphere and, in effect, picking and choosing winners and losers. How the Fed acted then stuck in the craw of many conservatives, in particular, for years after the crisis ended. In 2011, the governor of Texas, Rick Perry - who was also running for the Republican presidential nomination - called the Fed's aggressive bond buying \"almost...treasonous\" and even suggested then-Chair Ben Bernanke might get roughed up if he ever ventured to the Lone Star State. This time around? Crickets. In an appearance on Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made clear that he faces no groundswell of criticism this time around, either among the central bank's policymakers or the wider corridors of power. The priority, he said, remains on helping people who through no fault of their own have lost their livelihoods, at least temporarily, due to \"stay at home\" orders across the country. \"People are undertaking sacrifices for the common good. We need to make them whole. To the extent we have the ability to make them whole we should be doing that as a society,\" Powell said. \"They didn't cause this. Their business isn't closed because of anything they did wrong. They didn't lose their job because of anything they did wrong.\" And while he emphasized the Fed's role is to lend, not spend, staging an effective rescue means close coordination with Treasury and elected politicians, he said. \"Financial stability is really something where we both have a stake and both have authorities...we do work closely with them on these facilities and I'll say that's been a very productive relationship,\" he said. In the space of roughly a month the Fed has launched nine crisis-fighting programs - some old and some brand new - designed to keep credit flowing to businesses and households by shoring up liquidity in financial markets. The Fed's programs may end up helping some businesses whose trouble is at least partly of their own making - having loaded up on debt before the crisis, for instance. But for the moment, neither Fed policymakers nor politicians seem too concerned with separating the deserving from the less so. Economists at Citigroup Global Markets in a note last week said minutes of the Fed's emergency meetings \"predictably reflected a unified cohort of policymakers willing to use all available tools to support the economy, with little regard to second-order effects or moral hazard.\" And even as the size of the Fed's balance sheet sets new records weekly, Powell indicated there is little pushback should the Fed find other new, untested ways to help the economy. \"As we identify other areas, we won't hesitate to move into those areas,\" he said. BACK THEN, CONFUSED AND MUDDLED Back in 2008, objections were frequent and forceful. As the financial crisis gained steam, Fed officials were very concerned that their lending programs could reward or could be perceived as rewarding bad behavior. Indeed that was one reason Fed policymakers cited for allowing Lehman Brothers to fail rather than ride to its rescue. Raising the alarm weren't just inflation hawks like Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, but centrist Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart as well. Even Bernanke, speaking to colleagues in September 2008 just after the Lehman collapse, said he was \"decidedly confused and very muddled\" by the tension between the fiscal and moral hazard costs of the rescue on the one hand and the potential for \"severe consequences for the financial system and, therefore, for the economy of not taking action.\" In Congress, criticism of the Fed's bailout of banks was front and center. \"You are the definition of moral hazard,\" Senate Banking Committee member Jim Bunning, a Republican, told Bernanke at his confirmation hearing in late 2009. That tension is all but gone in 2020. \"We don't make decisions about individual firms,\" Powell said on Thursday. \"Any borrower that meets the eligibility requirements for one of these facilities can take part in the facility, we are not going to be picking this firm but not that firm.\" Fed policymakers are agreed on going full steam ahead, Powell said, in part because they learned from the last crisis that worries an increase in the money supply will cause runaway inflation are unfounded. With muted inflation in the decade since, the central bank chief was curt on Thursday. \"I worry that in hindsight, you will see that we could have done things differently, but one thing I don't worry about is inflation right now,\" Powell said.

The rover has been constructed in a large, sterile room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, near Los Angeles, where its driving equipment was given its first successful test last week. Shown to invited journalists on Friday, it is scheduled to leave Earth in July 2020 from Florida's Cape Canaveral, becoming the fifth US rover to land on Mars seven months later in February. \"It's designed to seek the signs of life, so we're carrying a number of different instruments that will help us understand the geological and chemical context on the surface of Mars,\" deputy mission leader <mark>Matt Wallace</mark> told AFP. Among the devices onboard the rover are 23 cameras, two \"ears\" that will allow it to listen to Martian winds, and lasers used for chemical analysis. Approximately the size of a car, the rover is equipped with six wheels like its predecessor Curiosity, allowing it to traverse rocky terrain. Speed is not a priority for the vehicle, which only has to cover around 200 yards per Martian day--approximately the same as a day on Earth. Fuelled by a miniature nuclear reactor, Mars 2020 has seven-foot-long articulated arms and a drill to crack open rock samples in locations scientists identify as potentially suitable for life. \"What we're looking for is ancient microbial life--we're talking about billions of years ago on Mars when the planet was much more Earth-like,\" said <mark>Wallace</mark>. Back then, the Red Planet had warm surface water, a thicker atmosphere and a magnetic force around it, he explained. \"And so it was much more conducive to the types of simple single-cell life that evolved here on Earth at that time,\" <mark>Wallace</mark> said. Once collected, the samples will be hermetically sealed in tubes by the rover. The tubes will then be discarded on the planet's surface, where they will lie until a future mission can transport them back to Earth. \"We are hoping to move fairly quickly. We'd like to see the next mission launched in 2026, which will get to Mars and pick up the samples, put them into a rocket and propel that sample into orbit around Mars,\" said <mark>Wallace</mark>. \"The sample would then rendezvous with an orbiter and the orbiter would bring the sample back to the Earth.\" Samples should reach Earth \"in the course of a decade or so,\" he added. To maximize its chance of unearthing traces of ancient life, Mars 2020 will land in a long dried-up delta called Jezero. The site, selected after years of scientific debate, is a crater that was once a 500-yard-deep lake. It was formerly connected to a network of rivers that flowed some 3.5 to 3.9 billion years ago. The crater measures just under 30 miles across, and experts hope it may have preserved ancient organic molecules. The Mars 2020 mission also carries hopes for an even more ambitious target--a human mission to Mars. \"I think of it, really, as the first human precursor mission to Mars,\" said <mark>Wallace</mark>. Equipment on board \"will allow us to make oxygen\" that could one day be used both for humans to breathe, and to fuel the departure from Mars \"for the return trip.\" The ambitions come as a new space race hots up, with Beijing increasingly vying to threaten US dominance. China on Friday launched one of the world's most powerful rockets in a major step forward for its own planned mission to Mars next year. NASA's Mars 2020 will remain active for at least one Martian year, which is around two years on Earth. But Martian rovers have frequently exceeded their intended lifespans--its predecessor Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 and is still trundling around the planet's Mount Sharp region.

Charleston to pay $6.5 M settlement to family of man shot by cop <mark>BRUCE SMITH</mark> Published: Thursday, October 8, 2015 at 8:00 p.m.. Last Modified: Thursday, October 8, 2015 at 8:47 p.m. NORTH CHARLESTON--City officials in South Carolina approved a $6.5 million settlement Thursday with the family of an unarmed black man fatally shot by a white police officer who was captured on cellphone video firing at the man's back as he ran away. The North Charleston City Council approved the settlement by a 10-0 vote, and members of <mark>Walter Scott</mark>'s family were on hand when it was announced. Scott, 50, was shot April 4 by North Charleston officer Michael Slager while trying to run from a traffic stop. A bystander recorded the shooting in dramatic cellphone video. Slager was indicted on a murder charge in June and a judge refused to set bond last month, saying his release would \"constitute an unreasonable danger to the community.\" \"While nothing can replace having <mark>Walter</mark> in our lives, the City of North Charleston's historic action ensures that he did not die in vain,\" Scott's brother Anthony said, noting the settlement will provide for Scott's children. \"It was a bittersweet victory,\" he added. \"The family still wants justice for my brother and this was a step in the right direction.\" Anthony Scott said the family plans to donate some of the money from the settlement to disaster relief for victims of the recent floods in South Carolina. Mayor Keith Summey said he was pleased with the settlement. \"The family took steps to keep the community calm, and for that the city is thankful,\" he said. \"This is a very difficult period for the Scott family. I know they are glad to have this part behind them so their healing process can continue.\" The bystander's cellphone video showed Slager firing eight times as Scott ran. The shooting inflamed the national debate about how blacks are treated by law enforcement officers. After the video went public, the family called for peace and calm in the community. At least in part, the family's actions are believed to have prevented the kind of violence that erupted elsewhere in the nation following the deaths of black men following encounters with law enforcement. The mayor said that since the shooting, North Charleston police have been outfitted with body cameras. Slager was not wearing one. Summey also noted the police department will be working with a division of the Department of Justice that helps local communities resolve issues involving race, color, national origin or gender. City Attorney Brady Hair said Summey met with the family and their attorney several days after the shooting. Hair said both sides felt that it was in everyone's best interest to reach a resolution and avoid a lawsuit. While attorneys for the family said at the time they might sue, they never did. A mediator helped negotiate the settlement, which Hair said will be paid by the city's insurance carrier and from the city's reserve fund. He said how much would come from each has not been worked out. Attorney <mark>Chris Stewart</mark>, who represents the Scott family, said a number of issues had to be considered in reaching the $6.5 million figure. Noting that North Charleston is no New York, he remarked, \"There is no way this city could pay $50 million.\" He said attorneys also had to consider the damage a drawn-out legal battle might do to the city and its residents. Hair said the $6.5 million represents the largest settlement for such a case in the state's history. Slager was fired following his arrest on the murder charges and has been detained in solitary confinement. Before the video was brought to the attention of authorities, Slager had told investigators that Scott tried to grab his gun and Taser. But prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said Scott was running away and the only time Slager could be seen running was to go back, pick up the Taser and then drop it by Scott's body. Slager faces from 30 years to life in prison without parole if he is convicted of murder. There were no aggravating circumstances such as robbery or kidnapping, so the death penalty doesn't apply in the case, the prosecutor has said.

Popular Stories Bubbly Sharon \"was truly an angel' Tributes flow for Garth\" Mr Noosa' Prowd Proving the grieving wife was actually calculating murderer Local Real Estate Cars For Sale A WOMAN has admitted to murdering Adelaide grandfather Robert Whitwell during a violent robbery that she carried out with her friend - who was the granddaughter of the victim and has already pleaded guilty to murder. On Monday, Bernadette Burns, 22, of Redbank Plains, 33km southwest of Brisbane, pleaded guilty to murder before Supreme Court Justice Trish Kelly. She was set to face trial for murder but has instead pleaded guilty to the crime - under a unique section of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act. Burns has admitted to committing an intentional act of violence while undertaking the robbery, which resulted in the death of Mr Whitwell. The offence - which is similar to the controversial US offence of \"felony murder\" - still carries the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Justice Kelly transferred the case to her colleague Justice <mark>Kevin Nicholson</mark>, who is hearing the matter of her co-accused Brittney Jade Dwyer, the granddaughter of Mr Whitwell. The pair will be back in court later this month. Shelby Lee Angie Holmes (left) and accused killer Brittney Jade Dwyer (right). Source: Facebook Last week, Dwyer, 20, faced sentencing submissions for her role in the killing of Mr Whitwell, 81, in his Craigmore unit in August last year. Dwyer, also of Redbank Plains, fabricated an eleventh-hour lie to tarnish the name of her victim and excuse her crime, the court was told. Supreme Court Justice <mark>Kevin Nicholson</mark> heard Dwyer told a psychiatrist that her grandfather may have sexually molested her as a child - but she wasn't sure if it was real or not. \"It is a most unpleasant assertion. It's unfounded in any other material,\" prosecutor Jim Pearce told the court. He said \"at one minute to midnight\" Dwyer was having flashbacks about something her victim may or may not have done, despite never having raised this as a motive at any other point in the investigation. \"In my submission, the court would be entitled to infer, with the absence of evidence from Ms Dwyer about this, that it is just simply an invention designed to give her an explanation for why she acted as she did,\" he said. \"Because the only other explanation is a premeditated, pre-planned, almost sociopathic killing.\" It's insidious to a man who was murdered in that way. \"He asked Justice <mark>Nicholson</mark> to place no weight on that part of the psychiatric report. Murder victim Robert Whitwell, who was found dead in his Craigmore unit on August 8, 2016. Dwyer's lawyer, Craig Caldicott, said his client wasn't sure whether\" her flashbacks \"were real or not and it would not be presented as a motive in the killing. He said the motivation was to steal money from her grandfather. Her case was then adjourned until after Burns' case had been finalised. Another friend, Shelby Lee Angie Holmes, 19, was sentenced last week for trespassing on Mr Whitwell's property in the months leading up to the murder. Holmes was jailed for 17 months with a non-parole period of nine months, suspended on the condition she be of good behaviour for three years. The court was told Dwyer and Holmes drove from Queensland to Adelaide to rob Mr Whitwell of\" thousands of dollars \"of the\" hundreds of thousands \"which they believed was kept in his shed. But the girls were frightened off by a sensor light, barking dogs and a nearby neighbour. Last month, Mr Whitwell's brothers told how they embraced his crying granddaughter in the days after his death - only to discover they had been comforting his killer. Dwyer had to listen as her family outlined their devastation and despair in victim impact statements read out in the Supreme Court by prosecutor Jim Pearce. In his statement, Mr Whitwell's brother Geoffrey Whitwell said he was devastated by his brother's murder and missed him dearly.\" Bob and I were very close, \"he wrote.\" We always came together for Christmas and Bob's birthday was special because it was on the same day as my wife's (birthday). \"He wrote that he would speak with his older brother on the phone frequently.\" But I'll never hear the phone ring with my brother on the other end, \"he said in his statement. Mr Whitwell said Dwyer, her mother Tonya Dwyer and brother all flew to Adelaide from Queensland after the murder.\" We welcomed you into our home, embraced you and comforted you, all the while you wept with your fake tears and made comments like \"my poor poppa',\" he said. \"I now know that I had been embracing and comforting my brother's killer. You are a master of deception, I will give you that.\" I will never forgive you. You're a cruel, deceitful person with no regard for human life - I believe you are dangerous and evil and deserve the highest penalty. \"Mr Whitwell's other brother, Peter Whitwell, also spoke of inviting Dwyer into the family home and comforting her in the days after his death.\" We were just coming to terms with his death when we found out it was his own granddaughter who was responsible, \"he said in his statement. Tonya Dwyer - whose daughter killed her father - also provided a statement to the court, saying she had been a happy wife, mother and daughter until everything changed on May 2 last year.\" (Now) I feel like I'm drowning in life, \"she said. Dwyer's father, Garry Dwyer, described his former father-in-law as a\" great man, who loved his family \". He asked the court to impose an\" appropriate \"jail term on his daughter. Dwyer pleaded guilty to the murder and in February and admitted to a further charge of aggravated serious criminal trespass between April 30 last year and May 2. crime Read More Login to follow murder Read More Login to follow national Read More Login to follow Topics: crime murder national 0 Stay Connected Update your news preferences and get the latest news delivered to your inbox.
