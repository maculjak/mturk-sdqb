don't lie - i bet it was blowing stuff up. lundgren: i loved the character that sly created for me in the first one. it's the second time he did that for me - the first one was 27 years ago, ivan drago, and i almost killed him in a fight. but now i'm on his side. crews: this was the biggest thing i've ever been involved in. i'll be honest with you, i would have done the first one for free, but my agent pointed a gun at my head and he's like,\" you're gonna get out there and make some money for me! \"and then my wife said the same thing when i got home. couture: why wouldn't you come back? it's not like you had to have your arm twisted. i was ecstatic to hear there was going to be a 2, and to hear rumblings there might be a 3 is awesome. stallone: doing a film like this is like having a dinosaur as a house pet - you know it's going to be extinct pretty soon, so enjoy it while it's here. rocky iv, could you imagine doing an action film 30 years later? stallone: no. i mean, you had the fantasy, but the reality hit that the business is so ferociously competitive now and so unforgiving. i have a feeling that they would never make rocky today. they may not even make first blood - first blood sat on the floor for five years. everyone passed on it. i was the 11th choice. after i did the movie, i said,\" my career's over .' that genre hadn't been done yet: the man against his own country, the one-man-army thing. so i thought i was done. i literally tried to buy back the film and burn it, for real. so who knew? lundgren: physical shape is important, too. these guys are in great shape for their age, and if you're not in shape, we couldn't do it. but does your training regimen change for the rigours of an action movie? stallone: it definitely intensifies for me. these guys work out much harder during the film than i do, but i try to front-load. i get in the best shape that i can and then have smaller workouts because i know it's going to be diminishing returns. every day, i'm going to get a little weaker, but if i come in in really good shape, i'll make it to the end. crews: i treat the film as a camp. we were in eastern europe, i had no family, i was 100 per cent all this movie. i would study my lines, go over them again, work out in the morning, and then i'd do it all again in the afternoon. anybody can be in shape, but you want people to understand your character. acting is a discipline. couture: i was already in shape, still training and competing, and it becomes part of your lifestyle. it's who you are, the things you do. lundgren: you focus a little more on the visual when you're filming because you want to show off a little more. you try to stay in shape and live through it. stallone: the ultimate first action films, of course, are seven samurai and yojimbo and the japanese classics. they were where i was first aware of bringing guys together, and then they did american takeoffs, like crews: i didn't come up in the dirty dozen days, but enter the dragon was in my formative times. as a kid, i never saw anything like that ., and what set the tone for my action career was tootsie (starring dustin hoffman in drag). i got in touch with my sensitive side. if i had to wear a dress, that would be really violent. how key is male camaraderie to a movie like this? stallone: it's very important. if there's one actor who has his own agenda and he's not a team player and he's dragging his lines and he's blowing his takes and he's arriving two hours late, it can throw such a negative spin on the whole process. crews: women bond through good times where men bond through pain.we were all sitting there like, \"man, i miss my family'. you're watching pain happen to your castmates, but what happens is you realise these guys are taking hits for the team. it's like in the nfl - when you watch somebody get de-cleated, you get a respect for the guy. stallone: when we're sliding down high-tension wires with one arm, it sounds like, hey, no problem, but by the sixth take, think about it: you're 200 pounds, you're hanging with one arm, and with the momentum and the g-force, after a while it gets old. especially if you're like us and have worn rotator cuffs. i literally cannot lift a four-pound pistol - i have to switch hands. these stunt guys, it's very dangerous because it's not been done and will never be done again. (terry's) smashing a guy's head into a pillar and the timing is critical, otherwise the guy will die for real. i know it must be very frustrating sometimes to work with green screen. i wish some of the younger actors could come into our world and just work under real conditions. i wouldn't know how to do it any other way. let's say sly is psychic and expendables is rebooted in 20 years. who's in it? stallone: oh, my god! i think the hemsworth brothers (liam and the avengers' chris) could definitely be in it. who would play me? lundgren: i could do the <mark>chuck norris</mark> part. stallone: it's hard to say because you don't know if you're going to be around in 20 years. crews: they're all on disney channel now. stallone: they haven't gone through puberty yet. call me in 10 years.",

parts of tyneside on his release from prison a gang leader has been banned from a tyneside estate for helping to organise a violent street fight. dean elliott was jailed for 32 months for his part in the brawl in churchill street, howdon, in april last year. the incident involved two rival groups attacking each other with weapons including swords, machetes and knives. one man was stabbed in the chest and needed hospital treatment. elliott, 22, who grew up in north shields and cullercoats, was described as the main instigator of the clash. his gang had a long-standing rivalry with another group, led by dale fuller. both sides had been provoking each other on facebook in the run-up to the fight. fuller, 25, of coldstream gardens, howdon, has already been barred from entering major parts of the town. now elliott, who is due to be released from prison today, has received the same ban after north tyneside council obtained an anti-social behaviour injunction at north shields county court. prosecutor peter rowbottom said: \"mr elliott is number 11 out of 16 people who were arrested and imprisoned after a serious incident of public disorder in howdon. ten others have been made subject to similar injunctions and there have been no breaches so far .\" this is being done to help rid this area of gang culture which resulted in violence. \"elliott, of blackpool, was not in court and district judge <mark>david grey</mark> granted the injunction in his absence. he said he was satisfied the defendant had been informed about the case and had the chance to instruct lawyers if he wished to. the order will run until august 2014. the exclusion zone covers the howdon, willington and holy cross areas of wallsend. after the hearing, colin boxshall, the council's safer estates manager, said:\" this injunction reaffirms our commitment to protecting communities from anti-social behaviour. \"we put victims first and take decisive action against perpetrators. others involved in

of its devices and political pressure to thwart efforts by google inc.'s motorola mobility to block imports of the iphone and ipad, two of the best-selling electronic devices in the u.s. the u.s. international trade commission in washington is scheduled to announce today whether iphones and other apple devices infringe motorola mobility patents and, if so, whether it will stop them from being imported into the u.s. from asia. as part of its review, the itc is weighing whether to limit use of import bans in disputes over patents that relate to industrywide standards. some members of congress, the u.s. federal trade commission and companies including intel corp. have urged such a step. \"i do not think, in the current legal and political climate, that there is any possibility that the iphone will be excluded from importation,\" said rodney sweetland, a patent lawyer with duane morris in washington who specializes in itc cases. motorola mobility says apple products infringe four patents, two of which relate to industry standards for 3g wireless and wi-fi technologies, and that apple has rebuffed offers to license the standard-essential patents. the other two patents aren't standard-essential, nor are the seven patents that are the subject of a new complaint motorola mobility filed aug. 17. apple denies infringing the patents and contends they're invalid. even if the commission finds a patent violation, apple says in filings that its devices shouldn't be stopped at the u.s. border. \"neat' products\" the commission is under some political pressure not to keep \"neat' products out of the country,\" said <mark>scott daniels</mark> of westerman hattori in washington, who does itc cases. \"normally, politics and congress have very little impact on commission rulings. in the case of something so central to the economy, there could be an impact .\" a trade judge in april said apple, which this week became the most valuable u.s. company in history, violated one patent that's essential to 3g. the commission is reviewing his findings. the iphone's $47.1 billion in sales and $20.4 billion in ipad sales together made up more than 62 percent of cupertino, california-based apple's fiscal 2011 sales, according to data compiled by bloomberg. the second standard-essential patent in motorola mobility's complaint also would cover mac computers, the ipod touch and apple tv. members of congress including house judiciary committee chairman lamar smith, a texas republican, wrote the itc in june saying the benefits of adopting standard technologies \"may be undermined\" if patent disputes threaten the ability to sell products in the u.s. the senate judiciary committee held a july 11 hearing on the issue. patent owners whose technologies are adopted as industry standards, such as specifications that let wireless phones communicate with one another, agree to charge fair and reasonable licensing fees. in those kinds of cases, the ftc urged the trade commission to take other steps, such as pushing for mediation of royalty amounts, before considering a ban on imports. blocking imports based on infringement of a standard - essential patent \"has the potential to cause substantial harm to u.s. competition, consumers and innovation,\" the ftc wrote in a june 6 filing with the agency. it said companies could be coerced into unreasonable licensing fees in a practice known as a \"patent holdup .\" motorola mobility says it fulfilled its obligation to make a reasonable royalty offer and apple refuses to negotiate. \"unwilling licensee'\" apple and others--without analyzing the facts of this case--point to the problem of \"hold up,'\" motorola mobility told the commission in a july 16 filing. \"but they ignore the counter problem of\" hold out'--an unwilling licensee being rewarded for its intransigence in a manner that will deprive patent owners of value and create disincentives for innovative companies from participating in standards setting. \"the case represents one battle in a broader global legal war over patents, including more than a dozen complaints at the itc over the past two years, as companies vie for increased shares of a smartphone market that grew 62 percent to $219 billion last year. apple, in one of the high-profile cases, is awaiting a california jury's verdict in a separate dispute claiming that samsung's android phones copied patented iphone features. in south korea today, the seoul central district court ruled that apple and samsung infringed each other's patents and told them both to stop selling some versions of their products in that country. google, based in mountain view, california, is counting on motorola mobility's long history with mobile phones--and its trove of 17,000 patents--to force apple into a settlement of the itc case that could also encompass handset makers using google's android operating system, including samsung electronics co. and htc corp. motorola mobility approached apple in 2007 about a patent license, demanding a royalty of 2.25 percent of the price of apple products. motorola mobility has said that's the standard offer it makes, and expects the figure to change during negotiations. apple and microsoft corp., which has its own legal fights with motorola mobility, said the demand was unreasonable. presidential review president barack obama could review a commission decision and reject any import ban on public policy grounds. in the past, patent owners have lost efforts to block imports for health - related products, for devices that reduced gasoline consumption during the 1970s oil crisis, and when the government was in the midst of trade negotiations. itc judge thomas pender, who presided over the trial, recommended that the agency issue an import ban on any product found to infringe the motorola mobility patents. he said apple should pay the 2.25 percent royalty rate during the 60-day presidential review period .\" extreme solution' qualcomm inc., which makes and designs chips for mobile phones and gets more than one-third of its revenue from licensing, said the ftc's suggestion for limiting import bans based on standard-essential patents is \"an extreme solution in search of a problem .\" the commission could say that an import ban isn't in the public interest, or delay imposing a ban to give apple and motorola mobility time to resolve their differences or to have other courts hear their cases, said david long, a patent lawyer with dow lohnes in washington. \"their challenge would be to create what relief they can if there is a violation,\" long said. \"it's up to congress to establish whether standard-essential patents are welcome at the itc, and congress hasn't done that .\" the case is in the matter of certain wireless communication devices, portable music data, processing data devices, computers and components thereof, 337-745, u.s. international trade commission (washington). apple inc.

carolina's wild 45-42 victory over georgia last september in athens, mark richt's fate with the bulldogs seemed sealed. he entered the season on the hot seat after uga stumbled to a 6-7 record in 2010, and an 0-2 start in 2011 was a harbinger of his doom. about the only thing that could save him would be some unlikely turnaround that allowed the dawgs to win the sec east. ten victories in a row, coupled with a pair of league losses for usc, helped avert a doomsday scenario for the coach. he ended his 11th year between the hedges with a 10-4 mark, east crown and trip to the sec championship game. it was a job-saving performance for sure, and even led to richt getting a contract extension through 2016. but richt can't get too comfortable just yet. you've heard of a trap game? this could be a trap season for the top dog. unlike 2011, when fans and pundits alike cast a wary eye toward uga's gridiron prospects, the expectations are clear this fall. simply put, if the no. 6 bulldogs don't win the sec east, the campaign will be a disappointment. and if georgia loses three or four games, just how safe will richt really be? there was a time when contracts and contract extensions could be taken at face value but that time has passed. just because a coach gets a new deal doesn't mean the deal is done. after leading alabama to 10 wins and an sec championship in 1999, mike dubose - fresh from being named sec coach of the year - was given a two-year contract extension that december. ten months later he was invited to resign after the tide won only three games. \"what have you done for me lately\" is a tired old expression but it very much applies to coaches who ply their trade in modern college football. i'm not sure if it's telling or not but when the financial terms of richt's contract were released earlier this summer, his salary was largely unchanged. it still falls in the $2.8 million per year range. on the other hand it was laden with incentives. if, for example, richt can guide the dawgs to both an sec and national championship, his combined bonuses will hit seven figures. does richt have to win the sec championship game this year to keep his job? of course not. but his team better be a contender from wire to wire. some are already conceding a loss to usc in columbia, but even so those same people figure the gamecocks will lose two sec games (they have to play at lsu and face arkansas). another loss to usc - which would make three in a row for georgia - would sting, but not necessarily derail the red and black from a trip to atlanta in december. and a spot in the league's title tilt is almost a must for richt if he wants to stay in the good graces of bulldog nation. whether you blame him or not for the rash of suspensions and arrests of bulldog players, they've occurred under his watch and cast the school in a poor light. that can't make athletics director greg mcgarity or school president <mark>michael adams</mark> happy. and while the sec has claimed the last six bcs national championships, six seasons have passed since georgia last topped the league. there are grand opportunities ahead of both richt and his football team this fall. college football preview: bulldogs ready to put it all together anderson's chili cook-off canceled this year to make way for new event proposed $30 million honea path nursing

argue his case at republican national convention poised at last to claim the prize he's been chasing for years, mitt romney has barrelled into tampa, florida, as republicans worked to showcase him at their national convention as a man who understands everyday americans and a leader who can fix the economy. ann romney, the woman who knows him best, said she was tickled that her husband would be on hand for her evening speech to the convention. and tough-talking new jersey govermor chris christie was ready to make the case in his keynote address for mr romney as the right leader to get the economy moving. \"it's going to be fun for him to be there,\" mrs romney told reporters before touching down in tampa, where she headed to the convention hall for a microphone check, practicing with a few lines from lincoln's gettysburg address. running mate <mark>paul ryan</mark> arrived in the convention city, too, still tweaking the speech he'll deliver tomorrow. but with new orleans and much of the gulf coast waiting fearfully to see where hurricane isaac makes landfall, politics became an awkward enterprise and no one knows what sort of party the republican gathering will turn out to be. after a one-day weather delay, the convention proceeds according to its latest script: delivering mr romney the presidential nomination he fought years to achieve, calling the party to unify around him and setting the stage for the final stretch of the hotly contested campaign to unseat president barack obama. mr obama, not one to cede the spotlight, tended to presidential business, urging gulf coast residents to prepare for the approaching storm. and then he headed out on a three-state campaign trip focused on winning over college students. mindful of the political perils of campaigning in the face of a natural disaster, aides said mr obama was open to adjusting his schedule if warranted. but campaign spokeswoman jen psaki added: \"it's important for him to be out there less than 70 days before the election making the case for why he's a better choice for the american people .\" mr romney has finalised his own friday aest convention speech, said aide stuart stevens, and it will be \"a clear vision of a romney presidency and very much from his heart about america and why he wants to be president and what his presidency would be like\". the cash demands of campaigning never far away, mr romney worked two fundraisers into the schedule for his first day in tampa, while ann romney and mr <mark>ryan</mark> both popped out new email appeals for campaign contributions. obama campaign manager <mark>jim messina</mark> was out with his own fundraising appeal for cash to fight what he said were sure to be distortions at the republican convention. the day's convention business got under way at midafternoon, with a string of republican governors and congressional candidates set to warm up the crowd for the roll call of the states that will nominate mr romney and the evening's main speakers. mr christie, ready for his keynote address, said that for those americans who aren't yet sold on mr romney, \"you start turning it around tonight\". in a round of morning talk-show appearances, mr christie said ann romney would humanise her husband for the nation, and that his own speech would make the case for mr romney's economic credentials. but ultimately, mr christie said, it will up to mr romney himself \"to let the american people see who he is\". meeting with michigan delegates, mr christie insisted that an effective president trumps likability. \"we need somebody who cares more about getting the job done than they care about being temporarily popular with any particular segment of our country,\" mr christie said. mr christie has his own fan club. \"i just love him,\" said sandy barber, a delegate from rural northwest ohio. \"he's plain-talking. he's himself. he's someone who lets his personality come through .\" mr romney \"is a different kind of personality. his personality exudes leadership .\" part of the tampa tableau: a slew of republican presidential also-rans: michele bachmann and herman cain posed for a photo after running into each other at the convention centre. mr cain joked that the caption could be: \"we ain't mad. we support mitt and <mark>ryan</mark>.\" newt gingrich and rick santorum were on hand too, both with speaking slots. the high campaign season opens with mr romney and mr obama about even in the last of the pre-convention polls, with each candidate possessing distinct and important advantages. the democrat is the more likable or empathetic leader; the republican is more highly regarded as the candidate who can restore the economy, the top issue for voters. ann romney's convention speech was designed to speak to that divide. it was an important part of the party's effort to flesh out her husband and present him to the nation as more than a successful businessman and the former republican governor of a democratic state, massachusetts. she went about the business of humanising the romney family with a taped appearance on cbs this morning in which she talked about the pain of a miscarriage, telling details about the experience that were news even to her husband. the romneys have five sons. isaac, which reached hurricane strength tuesday, skirted tampa, a big relief for convention organisers worried about the safety of the host city and gop delegates. but they remain saddled with the question of how to proceed with a political festival - one devoted both to scoring points against obama and firing up excitement for romney - under the shadow of a dangerous storm crawling toward the gulf coast. tampa awoke to sunny skies while convention planners monitored weather reports for the storm's impact on the gulf coast some seven years since hurricane katrina devastated the region. in a reminder of both the storm and the presidency, mr obama warned residents of the gulf coast to heed

runs in their first innings tomorrow and pick a few early wickets to put the hosts under pressure in the second and final cricket test, opener martin guptill said today. after scoring 328 for six on day one of the second test match at chinnaswamy stadium here, guptill said his team would now look to exploit the conditions as the wicket had swing and seam on it. \"the contest from here on would be interesting if my team put 400-450 on the board and pick a few wickets early on because there is a bit of swing and seam on this wicket. if we do that it will be great,\" he told reporters at stumps here. guptill said the wicket looked good and hoped the team would be able to continue the positive way of play next morning. \"the wicket was a little flat and our positive intent paid off well,\" he added. guptill said the team came out with a positive frame of mind of attacking the indian bowlers. \"<mark>ross</mark> (<mark>taylor</mark>) showed some excellent footwork,\" he added. guptill said new zealand had always played positive cricket and luckily the plan worked out for the team which alleviated some of the pressure off the team. \"we got enough boundaries initially that took load of us,\" he said. asked if being aggressive cost them too many wickets, guptill said: \"you are going to give chances when you play positive. we got away with it sometimes and not on other occasions. that\" s the way cricket goes. on whether indian bowling was below par as compared to hyderabad test, guptill said the hosts are a good bowling side, but the bad balls which they bowled were punished and it put pressure on them. guptill said it was all about properly executing a shot against the spinners as each player scores differently. \"sometime you opt to go straight, ariel and may not get it right. that happens in cricket. franklin didn't get it in the middle. he got a leading edge. it's quite different for each player,\" he said. \"each player scores differently. i think they should go for the shots and they would continue to do well .\" guptill was a bit disappointed for not converting his starts, but said he is trying to make sure that doesn't happen in the next few test matches. \"it is a little bit frustrating but that is the way it goes. sometimes you go on to make a big score and sometimes you go only half way there,\" he added. guptill also praised his captain <mark>ross taylor</mark> for scoring a brisk 113 and said he is a class player and his presence in the middle makes things a lot easier for the next batsmen. \"it takes a bit of pressure off them,\" he said.",
