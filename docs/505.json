(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Lawsuit Filed Against California County Fair Over Gun Show Ban By Zach Li January 29, 2019 Updated: January 29, 2019 Share LINKEDIN PINTEREST REDDIT TUMBLR STUMBLEUPON A Southern California county fair is being sued by the California Rifle & Pistol Association (CRPA) over its controversial ordinance prohibiting firearm vendors from continuing a gun show that has been held there for 30 years. The lawsuit, which was filed on Jan. 21, says that a gun show ban passed by the board members of Del Mar Fair in 2018 is unconstitutional and has violated the plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights and others. \"The 41-page complaint alleges that the Del Mar action has purposely violated the First Amendment free speech rights of the plaintiffs and constitutes a prior restraint on speech, along with the equal protection of the plaintiffs,\" said a written statement from the CRPA. Crossroads of the West, one of the plaintiffs, has held gun shows about five times a year at the fairground over the past 30 years, according to Fox 5. In September 2018, the 22nd District Agricultural Association, a nine-member board operating the Del Mar Fairgrounds on behalf of the state, decided to stop renewing the contract with the Crossroads of the West Gun Show for 2019.

Board President Steve Shewmaker said at a meeting that he's concerned about safety issues after several arrests were made in the fairground as felony offenders sent \"their wives and girlfriends in to buy ammunition and guns\" at the gun show.

However, the board's decision didn't convince everyone. \"It sounds like a nice,\" here is our olive branch,' but it's really nothing. It means we're going to do whatever we can to make sure you can't do your business model the way you normally operate, \"Tracy Olcott, president of Crossroads of the West, told Fox 5. Olcott also said the Crossroads shows typically brought the fairgrounds between $500,000 and $700,000 a year.

(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) The CRPA indicated in its statement that the ban is one of the campaigns aiming at annihilating gun shows at\" several state-owned fairgrounds \"across the state led by anti-gun activists who are trying to eliminate the\" gun culture. \"In 2018, then Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> vetoed a bill that would prohibit gun shows at the Cow Palace, which is a state-owned fairground at the Bay Area. Crossroads of the West is also the gun show organizer at the Cow Palace .\" In fact, the Fairground's own head of security noted that the gun shows are operating in full compliance with the law and that there are no safety concerns with the show, \"the statement reads .\" Nonetheless, the Del Mar Fair Board bowed to the political pressure of anti-gun activists and gave in to those Board members with a particularly strong bias against the tens of thousands of individuals who attend these shows. \"Share this article RECOMMENDED TOP VIDEOS Videos of the Day: US Acting Defense Secretary Meets NATO Secretary General in Pentagon 9hr By Epoch Newsroom Videos of the Day: Border Patrol Working to Stop Sickness at the Border 1d By Epoch Newsroom Videos of the Day: Pompeo Urges International Community to Financially Disconnect From Maduro Regime 2d By Epoch Newsroom US News November 8, 2018 What We Know About Ian David Long, California Bar Shooter By <mark>Jack Phillips</mark> Former U.S. Marine Ian David Long has been named as the suspect who shot and killed 12 people in a Southern California bar before turning the gun...Southern California November 28, 2018 Thousand Oaks Shooter\" Ambushed' First Officers on Scene, Say Police By Sarah Le, Epoch Times Officials have revealed new details to the public into the investigation of the Nov. 7 shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California that...US News January 22, 2019 Supreme Court to Hear Biggest Gun Rights Case Since 2010 By Reuters WASHINGTON--The Supreme Court took up its biggest gun rights case in nearly a decade on Jan. 22, agreeing to hear a challenge to New York City's strict...US News January 24, 2019 Supreme Court Green-lights NYC Gun Law Appeal By Matthew Vadum The Supreme Court has decided to take up a gun rights case for the first time in nine years, this time a challenge to New York City's...Southern California January 29, 2019 Insurance Claims From Deadly California Wildfires Top $11.4 Billion By The Associated Press SACRAMENTO, Calif.--Insurance claims from California's deadly November 2018 wildfires have topped $11.4 billion, making the series of fires some of the most expensive in state history, officials...Southern California January 26, 2019 California Election Watchdog Hopes to Set Up Town Hall With President Trump By Sarah Le, Epoch Times The Election Integrity Project California (EIPCa) hopes to set up a meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss safeguarding the integrity of the election process. \"We believe...US News January 25, 2019 US Returns Asylum Seekers to Mexico By Reuters TIJUANA/MEXICO CITY, Mexico--The United States was expected to send a first group of 20 Central American asylum seekers back to Mexico through the border city of Tijuana...US News January 25, 2019 California Couple and Dogs Rescued After Two-Week Mountain Ordeal By Tom Ozimek Members of the Special Enforcement Bureau tactical squad and sheriff's deputies rescued two California campers and their dogs, trapped by snow for two weeks in the mountains...Companies January 25, 2019 Suspicious Website Publishes False Press Release, Claiming to Be PG & E By Ilene Eng A suspicious website that imitates the official Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG & E) site issued a false press release on January 23 and fooled several media outlets.

Opening a crucial day of debate in the House of Commons, Mrs <mark>May</mark> said MPs had made clear what they did not want when they rejected her Withdrawal Agreement by a 230-vote margin earlier this month, but now it was time for them to tell Brussels what they do want. She called for them to send an \"emphatic message\" to the EU by backing an amendment tabled by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady which would require her to replace the backstop with \"alternative arrangements\" to avoid a hard border in Ireland. And she told them: \"If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit .\" Despite what she acknowledged was a \"limited appetite\" in Europe for reopening talks, she insisted: \"I believe with a mandate from this House...I can secure such a change in advance of our departure from the EU .\" The amendment from Sir Graham--the chair of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee--was one of seven selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow for consideration and possible votes on Tuesday evening. Also up for debate is a cross-party proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles--backed by the Labour frontbench--which would hand control over the Brexit process to Parliament, potentially delaying departure day from March 29 to the end of the year. Mr Bercow also selected Jeremy Corbyn's own amendment--which would allow debate on Labour's preferred plan or a second referendum--as well as others which would rule out a no-deal Brexit, extend the two-year negotiation under Article 50 or permit a series of \"indicative votes\" to establish the will of the Commons. The Commons chamber was packed as the day's debate on Brexit began (PA) In an attempt to fend off possible rebellion by Tories seeking to avoid a no-deal departure, Mrs <mark>May</mark> promised that Tuesday's votes would not be MPs' final chance to pass judgment on EU withdrawal. She told the Commons she aims to return to the House \"as soon as possible\" with a revised deal, which will be subject to a \"meaningful vote\" of MPs. If defeated, she will table another amendable motion for debate the following day. If no new deal is reached by February 13, the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day. Mrs <mark>May</mark> acknowledged that the Commons defeat of the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with EU leaders last November had been \"decisive\". And she told MPs: \"I listened .\" It was in the interests of the whole House to back the Brady amendment, which would resolve the main obstacle to Britain securing a smooth and orderly exit from the EU, she said. A cross-party amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper was selected for debate (PA) Mrs <mark>May</mark> said it was time for Parliament to \"speak as one\". \"I will never stop battling for Britain, but the odds of success become much longer if this House ties one hand behind my back,\" she said. \"I call on this House to give me the mandate I need to deliver a deal this House can support .\" Do that and I can work to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Do that and I can fight for a backstop that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland in a way this House can support. Do that and we can leave the EU with a deal that honours the result of the referendum. \"So the time has come for words to be matched by deeds. If you want to tell Brussels what this House will accept, you have to vote for it. If you want to leave with a deal, you have to vote for it. If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit .\" She warned those considering voting for the \"cacophony\" of rival amendments to rule out no-deal: \"Unless we are to end up with no Brexit at all, the only way to avoid no-deal is to agree a deal .\" That is why I want to go back to Brussels with the clearest possible mandate to secure a deal that this House can support. That means sending the clearest possible message not about what this House does not want but what we do want. \"Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s hopes of securing a majority for the Brady amendment were boosted when former foreign secretary and Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson said he would\" gladly \"vote for it, if it meant legally binding changes to the backstop. We can't have some codicil or letter or joint declaration. We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country 2/2--Boris Johnson (@ BorisJohnson) January 29, 2019 But the chances of the Commons derailing her plans were also heightened when Labour confirmed it will back the Cooper-Boles plan. Mrs <mark>May</mark> is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening. Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, and Ireland's European affairs minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned:\" There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage. \"But Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s official spokesman said:\" There is a very clear message from the EU's leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK. \"(PA Graphics) Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs <mark>May</mark> on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment. But it was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the 118 Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s deal on January 15. Remain-backing Tories <mark>may</mark> rally behind the Cooper-Boles amendment, while other proposals <mark>may</mark> gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit. MPs rejected <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of 230 votes earlier this month (Mark Duffy/UK Parliament/PA) Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party. Drawn up in meetings co-ordinated by housing minister Kit Malthouse, the compromise recasts the backstop as a\" free trade agreement-lite \", with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border and an extended transition period to December 2021. DUP leader Arlene Foster--whose 10 MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration in the Commons--said it provided a\" feasible \"alternative to the backstop .\" If the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on, \"said Mrs Foster.
