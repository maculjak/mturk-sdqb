you have to speak their language. activist leaders preparing for the next ballot fight can start by venturing outside their boardrooms. if you cannot engage dissenting voices within the lgbt community, you can hardly expect to reach more intractable voters. this point is evidently missed by human rights campaign president joe solmonese, who appeared willfully obtuse in a post-election message rejecting any \"if\" questions on how such a campaign might be run differently. he thus dismisses not just recrimination but the analysis and war-gaming essential to any effective campaign. to be fair, hrc doesn't run the statewide campaigns, and its support wins praise; but when we spend millions and still come up short, the post-mortems need to be opened up. as long as demonizing entire groups can lead to power and profit, unscrupulous people will keep doing it. right-wing blogger michelle malkin responded to the fort hood massacre by waving the red flag of group blame, reprising a 2003 piece on \"muslim soldiers with attitude .\" her message: the real culprits are multiculturalism, open borders, tolerance and diversity. in addition to the offensiveness of exploiting a tragedy, and the incongruity of a person of filipino ancestry talking as if america belongs to anglo saxons, malkin's attempt to scapegoat multiculturalism points to the right's long-term vulnerability. aside from most of america's mass killers having been white - theodore kaczynski, eric robert rudolph, timothy mcveigh - multiculturalism is not merely a philosophy but a fact of modern life. instead of seeking ways to promote mutual respect in a diverse society, the right stokes divisions by race, religion and sexual orientation for partisan gain. this cynical scavenging poses a greater threat to the social order than the demons conjured by the malkins of the right. when more moderate voters are disillusioned and stay home on election day, as appears to have happened in new jersey and virginia, they concede the race. unfortunately, an angry mob holds an advantage on motivation. maybe it's time to try something different to mobilize our base, and show some righteous indignation in defense of our lives and families. one minister of my acquaintance urges other clergy not to be distracted by the closet cases who all too often lead the anti-gay charge. the conflicted homosexuality of many anti-gay crusaders is an open secret, and those wise to it can dissuade others from enabling it without a public confrontation. but i would love to see someone like <mark>mike rogers</mark> of blogactive.com expose these ministers, whether we call their poison hypocrisy or something else. it is important that we aim our salvos accurately, as <mark>rogers</mark> has a record of doing. we cannot defeat right-wing recklessness with more recklessness. similarly, a \"damn them all\" attitude towards foot-dragging democrats can help elect even worse candidates. (for example, john aravosis has just launched an effort calling for a halt in donations to the democratic national committee, the obama campaign and organizing for america until enda is passed, and both \"don't ask, don't tell\" and doma are repealed .) in pressuring purported friends in office, we have more tools besides threats of withdrawal. to defeat right-wing wedge tactics, we must persuade prospective coalition partners of our mutual interests, which requires listening as well as talking. we should not allow setbacks to dishearten or unnerve us. time, as <mark>rogers</mark> observed last week, is on our side. there is not a single strategy, battlefield or organization for all of us to join. we have work to do in our legislatures and courts and families and communities - something to suit every person's talents and passions. if our campaigns have become too staid, we should try making them dance a bit more. but even dancing requires practice and discipline, if you want to do it well.", "articleID": "2009111207_00138022_W", "names": {"Mike Rogers": ["Q1933467", "Q970515"]}}, {"date": "2009-11-12", "url":

veterans, officials, children and parents. \"it's nice that my husband is helping his country,\" lasella said. \"veterans day means more to my son because my husband is serving his country .\" justin

left for asia, with the us economy, jobs and a yawning trade deficit with china looming large on his agenda. global climate change, the north korean and iranian nuclear disputes and obama's review of his afghanistan strategy are also major topics for his talks with the chinese and other officials on the first trip to asia of his presidency. \"i will be meeting with leaders abroad to discuss a strategy for growth that is both balanced and broadly shared,\" obama said at the white house before departing for japan, underlining the economic focus of his week-long trip. \"it is a strategy in which asia and pacific markets are open to our exports and one in which prosperity around the world is no longer as dependent on american consumption and borrowing but rather on american innovation and products .\" in an interview with reuters this week, obama described china as a \"vital partner, as well as a competitor .\" but he warned of \"enormous strains\" in relations between the world's two most powerful nations if economic imbalances between them were not corrected. those imbalances - america's excessive consumption and borrowing, facilitated by china's aggressive export strategy and purchases of us debt - are seen by many as a major cause of the boom and subsequent bust in the global economy. obama's nine-day tour includes a stop in singapore for the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit, followed by visits to shanghai, beijing and seoul. obama said he would talk to the chinese about revaluing their currency, the yuan, as well as encouraging chinese consumers to spend more and opening chinese markets further to us goods. with the u.s. unemployment rate now at 10.2 percent, the obama administration hopes an emphasis on building export opportunities will play well at home. giving obama a possible boost ahead of the trip, china signalled on wednesday it might allow appreciation of the yuan, saying it would consider major currencies - not just the dollar - in guiding the exchange rate. soaring us budget deficits have weakened the dollar because of us borrowing to meet the day-to-day spending needs of the united states. the dollar has declined against a basket of major currencies since mid-february. us manufacturers have long complained that beijing artificially holds down the yuan's value to make chinese exports cheaper and us goods more costly for china. but obama may face some pushback from china and other countries who worry that washington's drive for economic cooperation with asia may be too one-sided. ad feedback beijing is upset over us moves to slap tariffs on chinese tires and steel pipes, while south korea and other countries harbour doubts over whether obama, elected with strong labour union support, is committed enough to a free-trade agenda. the asia tour also comes as obama juggles many pressing domestic issues, including his drive to pass healthcare reform and climate change legislation, and nears the final stages of a decision on whether to send more us troops in afghanistan. seeking deeper ties one of obama's main messages will be a promise to put a high priority on engagement with the dynamic asia-pacific region, an area of the world where he has personal connections, having grown up in hawaii and indonesia. \"the president is the first president of the united states really with an asia-pacific orientation,\" said <mark>ben rhodes</mark>, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. \"he understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world .\" forging an effective working relationship with beijing will be crucial to any effort to deepen us engagement in asia. \"i certainly think this administration differs from its predecessors in its apparent recognition of the ascendancy of china and the ascendancy of asia,\" said david rothkopf, a business consultant and former us official. the obama administration's approach towards china, known as \"strategic reassurance,\" builds on a bush administration effort to ease mistrust between washington and beijing and encourage china to become a responsible stakeholder in global affairs. obama has been accused by some critics of giving short shrift to human rights issues but he said he would bring up the subject in his meetings in china. underscoring the importance placed on the three-day china visit, obama's itinerary includes a formal state dinner, a series of meetings with president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao and a dialogue in shanghai with chinese youth. japan will be another crucial leg of obama's trip. some in tokyo and in washington worry about a drift in relations between the two staunch allies. prime minister yukio hatoyama campaigned on a pledge to set a more independent course from washington and frictions have arisen over plans to relocate the us military base on japan's okinawa island. many japanese also wonder whether historic rival china's growing economic and military clout will affect relations between washington and tokyo, which mark the 50th anniversary of their security alliance next year.",

knowledge of their parents, to its former colonies, including new zealand, during the 20th century. as many as 150,000 poor british children were shipped off to the colonies over three and a half centuries, often taken from struggling families under programmes intended to provide them with a new start - and the empire with a supply of sturdy white workers. forty years after the programme stopped, britain and australia are saying sorry to the child migrants, who were promised a better life only to suffer abuse and neglect thousands of miles from home. the british government said on sunday that prime minister <mark>gordon brown</mark> would apologise for child migrant programmes that sent boys and girls as young as three to new zealand, australia, canada and other former colonies. many ended up in institutions where they were physically and sexually abused, or were sent to work as farm labourers. australian prime minister kevin rudd will offer his own apology on monday to the child migrants, as well as to the \"forgotten australians,\" children who suffered in state care during the last century. sandra anker, who was six when she was sent to australia in 1950, said the british government has \"a lot to answer for .\" \"we've suffered all our lives,\" she told the bbc. \"for the government of england to say sorry to us, it makes it right - even if it's late, it's better than not at all .\" the british government has estimated that a total of 150,000 british children may have been shipped abroad between 1618 - when a group was sent to the virginia colony - and 1967, most of them from the late 19th century onwards. most sent to australia after 1920, most of the children went to australia through programmes run by the government, religious groups and children's charities. a 2001 australian report said that between 6000 and 30,000 children from britain and malta, often taken from unmarried mothers or impoverished families, were sent alone to australia as migrants during the 20th century. many of the children were told that they were orphans, though most had either been abandoned or taken from their families by the state. siblings were commonly split up once they arrived in australia. authorities believed they were acting in the children's best interests, but the migration also was intended to stop them from being a burden on the british state while supplying the receiving countries with potential workers. a 1998 british parliamentary inquiry noted that \"a further motive was racist: the importation of\" good white stock' was seen as a desirable policy objective in the developing british colonies. \"ad feedback british children's secretary ed balls said the child migrant policy was\" a stain on our society. \"\"the apology is symbolically very important,\" he told sky news television. \"i think it is important that we say to the children who are now adults and older people and to their offspring that this is something that we look back on in shame,\" he said. \"it would never happen today. but i think it is right that as a society, when we look back and see things which we now know were morally wrong, that we are willing to say we're sorry .\" making amends britain has been trying to make amends since the late 1990s by funding trips to reunite migrants with their families in britain. <mark>brown</mark>'s office said officials would consult with representatives of the surviving children before making a formal apology next year. official apologies for historical wrongs have proved controversial. former australian prime minister <mark>john howard</mark> initially resisted calls to apologise to institutionalised children and australian aborigines, arguing that contemporary australians should not take responsibility for mistakes made by past generations. rudd reversed the policy after he was elected in 2007 and apologised to aborigines for 200 years of injustice since european settlement. at a ceremony on monday in canberra that hundreds of former child migrants are expected to attend, rudd will apologise for his country's role in the migration and say sorry to the 7000 survivors of the programme who still live in australia.", "articleID": "2009111521_00000789_W", "names": {"Gordon Brown": ["Q10648", "Q1537981", "Q18763895", "Q20979218", "Q3110844", "Q5584912", "Q5584914",
