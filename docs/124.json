Photo: Evan Vucci, AP <mark>Trump</mark> urged to tackle campaign finance in\" swamp draining' 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP)--Washington lawmakers acknowledge they spend a \"sickening\" amount of time raising money--and a bipartisan advocacy group sees President-elect <mark>Donald Trump</mark> as part of the cure. Issue One has united 165 former members of Congress, governors and administration officials behind a plan to rewrite campaign finance laws to give small donors more power in the political process. The coalition is led by former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer, who says Republican and Democratic lawmakers often describe their fundraising duties as \"sickening.\" \"You had <mark>Trump</mark> saying he was going to do something about this,\" Roemer told a news conference Wednesday. He said <mark>Trump</mark> and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, both of whom raised hundreds of millions of dollars from small donors, \"launched a hand grenade into Washington with this election.\" As presidential candidates, both lambasted the influence that money--particularly from big donors--holds over politicians. Lawmakers, Roemer said, think <mark>Trump</mark> could use his political juice next year to help pass the first major campaign finance overhaul in more than a decade. After the 2002 legislation known as McCain-Feingold, which limited how much special interests could give to the political parties, court rulings and legal and regulatory changes have cleared a path for unlimited donations to outside groups. That has reduced the importance of smaller donations. Republican former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, part of the Issue One effort, said the current system is \"awash in money, with little or no accountability\" and said Washington should embrace voters' calls for change. Issue One has passed along its policy proposals to <mark>Trump</mark> transition aides Kellyanne Conway, <mark>Donald Trump</mark> Jr., Steve Bannon and others, said Nick Penniman, the group's executive director. Key pieces include incentivizing small donors by providing them a tax rebate and restructuring the Federal Election Commission. The group is hoping to break through to <mark>Trump</mark>, who has put forward no policy proposals on campaign finance even as he has repeatedly pledged to \"drain the swamp\" of Washington. His swamp-draining platform centers on curbing the influence of lobbyists, and Penniman says its failure to include campaign finance proposals is a major oversight. Yet many of <mark>Trump</mark>'s actions and comments on the campaign trail have campaign-finance reformers feeling hopeful. Throughout the primary campaign, when he was largely paying out of his own pocket, the billionaire New York businessman called out rivals as \"puppets\" of big donors and promised to change the system. In the general election, <mark>Trump</mark> dialed back that rhetoric as he began raising money--including from donors writing half-million-dollar checks to his campaign and party allies. Still, <mark>Trump</mark> was one of most successful low-dollar fundraisers in history. His campaign raised more than twice as much from people giving less than $200 than from larger donors, fundraising documents show. Democratic former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who also signed on to the Issue One plan, said <mark>Trump</mark> might be able to achieve what President Barack Obama couldn't--sweeping changes in how federal campaigns are financed. Despite running on such a mantra in 2008, Obama \"did not engage in this issue very strongly at all,\" Glickman said. <mark>Trump</mark> can take up the fight because \"he doesn't have a stake in this current system like I think previous presidents have,\" Glickman said. __ Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at http: //www.twitter.com/bykowicz Most Popular 1 Video: Troopers save driver from burning car 2 Staples winter preview: Seideman, Pritchett form 1-2 punch for...3 Greens Farms opens new squash facility with Staples 4 Police: Westport man ran from cops after crash 5 Westport police: Weston man drove drunk, ran red light 6 To Kill a Mockingbird: Still relevant after 50 years 7 Stratford man allegedly shoplifted in Westport View Comments & copy; 2016 Hearst Communications, Inc. ."}, {"articleID": "2017050313_00564384_W", "names": {"Michael Garvey": ["Q16232116", "Q57033300", "Q6830539"]}, "date": "2017-05-03", "url": "http://www.tiftongazette.com/sports/marlowe-wins-state-hurdles-championship/article_96dff0ce-2f84-11e7-9451-fb8cb7676825.html", "content": "Marlowe wins state hurdles championship TIFTON--Tiftarea Academy's Marlee Marlowe was crowned state champion Saturday in the Georgia Independent Schools Association state Class AAA track meet in the 100-meter hurdles.

Marlowe wins state hurdles championship Becky Taylor 3 min ago Sarge Dorsey Marlee Marlowe won an individual championship at Saturday's state track meet for Tiftarea Academy, running the 100 hurdles in 16.04 seconds. TIFTON--Tiftarea Academy's Marlee Marlowe was crowned state champion Saturday in the Georgia Independent Schools Association state Class AAA track meet in the 100-meter hurdles. Competing at Albany's Hugh Mills Stadium, Tiftarea finished 13th overall in the boys meet and 14th in the girls, accumulating four and 16 points, respectively. Deerfield-Windsor swept the meet, though it had to settle with Trinity Christian of Dublin for a tie in boys. Both Deerfield and Trinity totaled 114.5 points. The Lady Knights scored 92 points to defeat Augusta Prep by seven. Marlowe's win \"feels really great,\" said David Dark, head coach of Tiftarea's track team. \"She blew the competition away,\" he said. \"She ran almost a full second faster in the finals.\" Marlowe, who also won the region hurdles title earlier in April, had qualified in a preliminary Thursday for the finals at the top of the heap in 16.7 seconds. She then improved upon that time in the finals by running in 16.04 seconds. The time allowed her to finish more than a half-second ahead of her nearest competitor, Teresa Dominguez of Holy Spirit Prep, who finished in 16.83 seconds. Dark said the competition was actually stiffer in the preliminary. One of Marlowe's top opponents fell in the qualifier and did not finish in time to make the final round. He refused to accept any credit for Marlowe's championship. That, he said, should be split among two people: Marlowe and Newell \"Sarge\" Dorsey. A Tiftarea stalwart for all sports, Dorsey coached the 1984 Lady Panthers to the state title. \"Marlee's hard work and Sarge's great,\" Dark said. \"He's really her coach.\" Tiftarea earned points in four other events, the girls 400 meters, girls long jump, boys 800 meters and boys 4x400. Adylein Hunt was sixth in the long jump at 15' 04.25. \"\"Adylein jumped a foot farther than she had all season,\" said Dark. Sixth place also went to Abby Carswell in the 400. He said he was \"really proud\" of her finish, as well as Adam McKinney, who was eighth in the 800. Even more impressive for McKinney, he shaved 10 seconds off his previous time. McKinney was also on the sixth place 4x400 relay team with Jackson Cook, Logan Carswell and Spence Massey. McKinney was not originally set to run with the group, but was forced into duty after an injury to Dallas Hunt. Hunt was injured during state and did not finish his individual race, the 1,600 meters. Dark said Hunt sacrificed his own race for the 4x400 team to help them qualify for the finals. \"He didn't finish that race so he had something to give.\" McKinney had not trained much for the 4x400, but quickly jumped into the slot. Tiftarea didn't miss a beat, finishing within a second of their qualifying time. Dark said the meet was bittersweet. Logan Carswell and Cook are seniors and this was their last ever meet for Tiftarea. Though they did not earn points, he was also proud of Kassidy Goodman and <mark>Michael Garvey</mark>. Goodman won region in shot put and was 12th in the finals. <mark>Garvey</mark> was 10th in discus.

The latest economic forecasts from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) indicate that the UK's overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate should improve by 3 per cent this year. In response to weakening economic signals from abroad and lower-than-expected household consumption growth, this is slightly down on the group's earlier prediction of 3.2 per cent. However, despite the slight downgrade, the business group said further growth is expected to be seen in the building industry between now and 2016. It said the output of the construction sector should grow by 4.9 per cent in 2014, in full-year terms. Looking further ahead, the body added that construction output growth rates of 1.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent should also be witnessed respectively in 2015 and in the following year. Employers in the construction trade continue to offer apprenticeship schemes, in order to plug skill gaps and provide work opportunities to young people. These efforts appear to be having a positive impact, with the BCC suggesting that the unemployment total among 16 to 24 year-olds should drop from 737,000 in the third quarter of this year, to 533,000 in the same period of 2017. The UK's wider unemployment figure should dip from 1.959 million to 1.839 million by the third quarter of next year, meanwhile, the group suggested. Despite the downgrade in the headline GDP forecast, BCC director general <mark>John Longworth</mark> said the UK should remain one of the world's quickest-growing developed economies this year. He added: \"This is a great achievement, and businesses up and down the country should be congratulated for their hard work and resolve to drive the recovery in the face of challenges and uncertainty both at home and abroad.\" As Britain continues to recover from the effects of the recession, the BCC said businesses should see further economic growth in both 2015 and 2016. It said the country's GDP reading is likely to improve by 2.6 per cent next year and by another 2.4 per cent in 2016. Among its other predictions, the trade body said business investment levels should stay strong. It said these investments should go up by 7.5 per cent in 2014 alone.

elected as the company's chairman of the board. while lewis has been at the helm, the bank has received us $45-billion in government aid. scott silvestri, a spokesman for charlotte, north carolina - based bank of america, declined to comment on lewis yesterday. lewis said earlier this month that the firm \"absolutely\" doesn't need more capital, while adding that the decision on whether to convert the u.s.'s previous investments into common equity is \"now out of our hands.\" citigroup, in a statement, said the bank's \"regulatory capital base is strong, and we have previously announced our intention to conduct an exchange offer that will significantly improve our tangible common ratios.\" along with bank of america and new york-based citigroup, some regional banks are likely to need additional capital, analysts have said. suntrust banks inc., keycorp, and regions financial corp. are the banks that are most likely to require additional capital, according to an april 24 analysis by morgan stanley. bank of america advanced 2.6% to us $8.36 in german trading and citigroup climbed 3.5% to us $2.99. suntrust slipped 0.2% to us $13.69 in germany. by taking the less onerous path of converting preferred shares, the treasury is husbanding the diminishing resources from the $700 billion bailout passed by congress last october. \"does that indicate that's what the regulators actually believe, or is it that they felt politically constrained from doing much more than that?\" said douglas elliott, a former investment banker who is now a fellow at the brookings institution in washington. geithner said april 21 that us $109.6-billion of tarp funds remain, or us $134.6-billion including expected repayments in the coming year. lawmakers have warned repeatedly not to expect approval of any request for additional money. some forecasts predict much greater losses are still on the horizon for the financial system. the international monetary fund calculates global losses tied to bad loans and securitized assets may reach us $4.1-trillion next year. geithner has said repeatedly that the \"vast majority\" of u.s. banks have more capital than regulatory guidelines indicate. the stress tests are designed to ensure that firms have enough reserves to weather a deeper economic downturn and sustain lending to consumers and businesses. he also said there are signs of \"thawing\" in credit markets and some indication that confidence is beginning to return. his remarks reflected an improvement in earnings in several lenders' results for the first quarter, and a reduction in benchmark lending rates this month. financial shares are poised for their first back-to-back monthly gain since september 2007. the standard & poor's 500 financials index has climbed 18% this month, while still 73% below the high reached in may 2007. national post -

Trump took several days to specifically address the hate groups' actions but in a recent press conference said there were \"very fine people\" on both sides of the conflict. On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke out about Trump's refusal to fully condemn the hate groups who participated, saying, \"President Trump this afternoon gave a press conference that can only be described as clinically insane.\" Meyers went on to highlight Trump's comparison of a Confederate general to George Washington. He also highlighted White House Chief of Staff <mark>John Kelly</mark>'s slumped posture during the speech. The late-night host joked, \"Trump is so fully out of his mind he broke a general. That guy's been in wars.\" Seth Meyers ended his segment, titled \"Breaking Crazy,\" with a call to Congress to \"cut bait\" on the President.

JPG Ring In September 2013, Jamie Siminoff went on ABC's \"Shark Tank\" in hopes of raising $700,000 for his company, DoorBot. He thought it was worth $7 million. His company made a video doorbell that connected to your smartphone, so you could remotely see and talk to the person at the door through your mobile device. The idea was largely based on the fact that burglars tend to ring the bell before breaking in. With DoorBot, you could see who's at the door, and even pretend you're at home when you're not, making it a convenient home security device. Siminoff was already making about $1 million in annual sales then, and he had high hopes of getting one of the \"sharks\" in as investors of his company. But the sharks weren't impressed. One by one, the sharks dropped out, leaving only Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \"<mark>Mr. Wonderful</mark>,\" as the last potential investor. O\u2019Leary's offer wasn't too enticing: he'd offer a $700,000 loan, then take 10% of all sales until the loan was paid off. After that, O'Leary wanted to collect a 7% royalty on all future sales, forever, plus 5% stake of the company's equity. Siminoff rejected the offer and walked away with nothing. \"It's that moment when I say you're dead to me, because you don't want to take my offer,\" <mark>Mr. Wonderful</mark> told him. You can watch Siminoff's appearance on \"Shark Tank\" below (it starts at 2:03): Youtube Embed: The most important thing that's ever happened to the business Going on \"Shark Tank\" doesn't guarantee you airtime. Siminoff says when you leave the set, the producers simply tell you, \"Someone will call you.\" \"It's like you literally have no way of contacting anyone when you leave that set that day,\" Siminoff told Business Insider. \"We were like,\" Ah, s--t.' So we just had to block it out as if it just never happened because that was a possibility. We were pretty significantly disappointed by not being able to raise money on the show. \"But DoorBot still had a pretty solid business and was growing fast. It had $250,000 in sales in the month before going on\" Shark Tank, \"all online. And after two months, Siminoff was able to raise $700,000 at a $7 million valuation (the exact amount he had offered the sharks). And a week after raising, he also received a call from the\" Shark Tank \"producers.\" It's going to air, \"they told him. The episode featuring Siminoff ended up airing in November 2013. And as soon as the show aired, DoorBot took off like crazy.\" We think we got at least $5 million of additional sales through the airing of \"Shark Tank,\" ' Siminoff said. \"It just absolutely throttled our revenue, awareness in the market from every level. Everything just popped after that.\" \"It was probably the most important thing that's ever happened to the business,\" he continued. \"It's almost like it gave us a free check.\" Richard Branson's call As the company grew, Siminoff wanted to create a more serious image, and so he changed the name of the company to Ring. His company's credibility went up too, and soon he was able to get into some of the world's top retailers, including Home Depot, Target, and BesetBuy. Now Ring's products are sold in 93 countries worldwide. Its wider reach also led to what Siminoff describes as a \"lucky break\" with one very prominent investor: Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group with a net worth of $4.8 billion. & copy; Provided by Business Insider Inc RBransonRing Siminoff says a Ring customer happened to be vacationing at Branson's island a couple months ago. He used Ring to talk to a UPS delivery guy who was at his home in San Francisco. Branson, who happened to be next to that person, saw the interaction and was immediately hooked by the product. In fact, Branson liked it so much, he asked for Siminoff's email address and soon started talking business with Siminoff. He wanted to invest in the product. \"I didn't even figure he'd invest,\" Siminoff said, who at the time was just about to close a Series B round. \"But then he was like,\" What if I send someone right now?' And then I got on with a couple of his guys from his team of investment the next day. \"In less than 48 hours, Branson agreed to join the round. And on Wednesday, Ring made it official: a $28 million funding that gives it a $60 million valuation. Other investors include: Shea Ventures, American Family Insurance, True Ventures, and multiple angels, including Sky Dayton.\" [Branson's team] was actually really careful with their due diligence. Probably more than any other investor we had, \"Siminoff said. Looking back, Siminoff says it's still hard to believe everything unfolded the way it has.\" It's like beyond surreal. I still can't believe it. \"But it also makes him feel pretty good about his business, especially after getting turned down in a public manner by some of the top celebrity investors.\" I think it's a little bit of redemption that I'll take a slight smile on, \"he said.\" But I got to get back to focus, get back to work now. \"NOW WATCH: All the incredibly useful things you didn't know your iPhone headphones could do Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report inappropriate content Sorry!
