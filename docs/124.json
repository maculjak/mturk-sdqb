the street attendees named as their favourites. <mark>david proctor</mark>, the author of a series of books set in a post-apocalyptic toronto where \"condos block out the sky in every direction,\" couldn't have picked a better time to make his debut at the city's largest literary festival. this year's word on the street festival was one of the best-attended in the festival's history, with thousands showing up, but also one of the most political. <mark>proctor</mark>'s latest in his \"condopocalypse\" series concludes with the destruction of kensington market and the construction of a \"mega-condo\" in its place. \"i've been told this is non-fiction,\" he said. queen's park was closed off sunday morning - a warm and sunny autumn day - lined with book booths and food trucks and visited by a steadily growing crowd of people celebrating all things books. june dickenson, head of public relations at the festival said the mood of the festival was different this year because of the talk of budget cuts at city hall. \"people are saying i want to see the authors because it (the festival) may be taken away from us .\" last year, she said, there wasn't such urgency. \"nobody rallied around things the same,\" she said. the toronto public library workers union, which represents 2,400 full and part-time employees, made its inaugural appearance. maureen o'reilly, a librarian and the union's president, said she got over 1,000 signatures on her petition to keep libraries open and sold all 350 of her grey canvas tote bags emblazoned with her union's logo. in a way, the union's bags and pins became the chic accessories of the festival - a defiant kind of political statement. \"nobody in their right mind assumes they'll run into (mayor) rob ford here,\" said <mark>dennis raphael</mark>, professor of health policy at york university, carrying a union bag and wearing a red tommy douglas shirt. the other festival must-have was the little book of rob ford, a pocket book of the mayor's quotes published in 2011 by house of anansi press. the anansi booth was giving the book out free with another purchase, while the unionized library workers were giving it away outright. an varied assortment of word-loving groups attended the festival, including the poets league, the horror writers association (complete with a grave stone rip-patterned tablecloth), and chizine publications, a publisher of surreal and disturbing fiction. \"if we can frighten dogs and children we're doing our job,\" said co-publisher sandra kasturi. republican approach would

<mark>chavez</mark> nationalizes local ferry company email print next page? caracas (reuters) - venezuelan president <mark>hugo chavez</mark> nationalized a local ferry company on monday in his latest move to put more of the south american opec member's economy under socialist state control. the company, conferry, which operates ferries from the mainland to the resort island of margarita, had been sanctioned in the past by the state consumer protection body for delays, technical failures and repeated customer complaints. \"no more. that is a disaster. we're going to nationalize it? the safety of our people who travel to margarita is very important,\" <mark>chavez</mark> said in a telephone call to state television. company officials were not immediately available to comment. conferry is owned by a wealthy family and began operating in 1959. it has three vessels, only two of which are operating, sailing from puerto la cruz and la guaira. the 57-year-old socialist leader has put swaths of the economy under state control during his 12 years in power, including most of the crucial oil sector. he is recovering after a fourth session of chemotherapy to treat cancer, but has vowed to win a new six-year term in a presidential election due in october 2012. also drawing <mark>chavez</mark>'s ire were emergency landings on monday in the southeast of the country by two planes operated by local companies. \"we must tighten the screws on all public and private companies to ensure they maintain their aircraft,\" he said. more in regional news reader comments? the comments section is

2011, will be handed over to marshall university by the end of february 2012. huntington--the veterans memorial field house's days officially were numbered wednesday night after the greater huntington park and recreation district board unanimously voted on a deal that would put the property in the sole possession of marshall university by the end of february 2012. after months of negotiations, park and university officials reached a deal earlier this month that will allow for the transfer of the property from the district to marshall for a planned soccer stadium complex, which also will include a public park. part of the deal requires that any structure constructed on the property, regardless of ownership, will include \"veterans memorial\" in the title, which will be accompanied by appropriate signage. any other naming rights or sponsorships will be prohibited from being displayed more prominently than the \"veterans memorial\" sign. the deal also includes $100,000 from marshall to the district to create a half-acre neighborhood park on the site that also would commemorate veterans. the park, which will be named \"veterans memorial park,\" will include a playground, a picnic shelter and an american flag-themed rock-climbing wall. many of the deal's details involve making a notable dedication to veterans, which always was the goal of the field house said ken wolfe, president of the park district. \"the number one thing in all of this was for us to be able to continue to honor the veterans,\" wolfe said. \"we were never concerned that we would lose that, and this will even be sort of an upgrade in how we honor them and pay tribute to them by taking a deteriorating structure they used and providing a brand new facility that will still be named for them and available for their use .\" one of the details of the deal simply states that \"marshall university will make the new facility for available for community use,\" and that the university will be responsible for \"satisfying any and all claims that other entities, including the cabell county board of education, may have on the property .\" the park district will honor its commitments through february 29, 2012, which include the st. joe invitational basketball tournament, which will be one of the final events to take place in the field house. a veterans memorial field house grand finale basketball game is planned for saturday, feb. 11, 2012 and will be the very last event at the field house before it is transferred to marshall. the proceeds from the finale will be split 50-50 between the park district and marshall as will the proceeds from a salvage sale featuring items including chairs and the basketball flooring that will take place at a later date. in the past decade, the park district has spent more than $520,000 to support revenue losses at the field house, but the board was not looking to sell the property when marshall officials approached them this past spring. marshall plans to spend approximately $5.4 million through a bond issue to demolish the field house and build a soccer stadium complex that would include a turf field, seating, locker room facilities and lighting. the field house has a leaking roof, which has been patched numerous times, and, when the board was approached about the deal, they were looking into repairs that would have cost between $940,000 and $1.4 million. wolfe said there was \"no reasonable likelihood\" that the district would ever be able to obtain funds to replace the roof. jason aldean \"my kinda party\" tour 2011 7:30
