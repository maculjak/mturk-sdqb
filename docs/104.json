before the tipsy millionaire shows up in an alcoholics anonymous meeting. it's merely the latest amble into tone-deafness for a movie that, despite a lot of funny lines and a committed performance by the big screen's newest professional drunk, russell brand, fails. the original arthur (dudley moore) wouldn't have dreamed of twelve step meetings. the makers of that first film, which was a huge hit and won john gielgud an oscar, were just as politically incorrect in their day. but they knew, even while making a giggling drunken wastrel their hero in the early days of mothers against drunk driving, of celebrating a wealthy spendthrift in the reagan recession, how much of a buzz-kill the very idea of of aa interrupting arthur's bender would be. the new \"arthur\" has a winning cast - brand, helen mirren in the john gielgud role, jennifer garner as the rich girl arthur is ordered to marry and the charming greta gerwig in the poor little liza minnelli role. it's got some zingers recycled from the first movie and more than a few new one-liners that land. \"did you kill minnie mouse, or did she surrender that dress willingly?\" hobson (mirren) sneers at arthur's new infatuation (gerwig). brand is arthur bach, a rich brit brat whose wicked wicked ways have made him a fixture in the new york tabloids. we meet him as he and his chauffeur (<mark>luis guzman</mark>) run the batmobile - yes, he's bought it - under the wall street bull statue. arthur has more cars than jay leno, more toys that toys r us and has grown up so pampered and spoiled that he knows nothing of the real world. but one arrest too many - he extravagantly and generously bails everybody at the jail - forces a meeting with his frosty, distant mum (geraldine james). \"i remember from when i used to live in your womb!\" when mother stops going on about \"that charming coffee-colored gentleman who runs the country,\" she decrees that arthur must marry susan, her favorite ruthless go-getter executive. she's played with a venal verve by jennifer garner, and the fact you kind of root for her throws the whole story out of balance. then there's the hand-to-mouth tour guide arthur meets on his way home from the auction where he bought the suit lincoln wore to his second inaugural, a suit he promptly dons. he rescues naomi (gerwig) from arrest (she has no license) with a bit of fanciful invention. the cops want to see his id. arthur produces a penny. there isn't any chemistry between brand and gerwig, which may explain why she's not in the commercials or the poster. she's winsome and fetching, but the spark isn't there. meanwhile, the wedding plans continue apace, and we see just how far gone nick nolte's voice is - he's the two-fisted, menacing builder who is the father of the bride. arthur accidentally shoots him with his own nail gun and jokes about how nails in the hands \"made a hero out of jesus .\" oh no he didn't. the first 45 minutes of this have plenty of laughs as we navigate \"the vast moat of champagne called last night\" and enjoy mirren's way with a one-liner. brand's offhand delivery of a whispered \"help me\" to the diners in a restaurant where arthur is forced to propose and garner's drunken seduction scene - the one involving arthur's magnetic levitation bed that you see in the commercials - are a stitch. but i never bought mirren's nanny snobbery (gielgud sold it, and how), arthur's foray into the world of working people (a job at dylan's, new york's most famous candy store) and i don't want to know why arthur drinks. not for a comedy.

outside fenway park. a worker cleared the dust and litter just inside gate d with a high-powered vacuum. the historic home of the boston red sox was just about ready for its 100th opener on friday. the team needs plenty of work. the high-priced red sox were a popular pick to win the world series. so far they've lost every game, six in a row, their worst start in 66 years. the team batting average is .181. the era is 7.13. but even with the rival new york yankees coming in for a three-game series, signs of panic seem as rare as a red sox rally. \"we're going to score a lot of runs,\" said jon lester (notes), who pitched seven shutout innings in thursday's 1-0 loss to the cleveland indians. \"it's just a matter of time .\" back home, fans, usually quick to ask \"what haven't you done for me lately?\" were surprisingly calm in their calls to all-talk radio shows. brandon in allston: \"i don't think the red sox are done .\" but another caller said the team seemed to lack focus and a third questioned manager terry francona's toughness. francona was loose before thursday's game and matter of fact afterward. that was a sharp contrast to st. louis manager tony larussa, who went on a postgame rant after wednesday's 3-1 loss to pittsburgh when asked about the cardinals' offseason effort to improve its lineup-an effort that, so far, has failed. for the red sox, the pressure is building to get that first win, especially with saturday's and sunday's games against the yankees on national television. but they'll have the advantage of playing before their own fans, a full house that is sure to cheer loudly during pre-game introductions. their reaction might be different if starter john lackey (notes) struggles. \"there's not two red sox teams. there's only one,\" designated hitter <mark>david ortiz</mark> (notes) said. \"you gotta cheer for this one if you are a red sox fan, right?\" history works both ways. sure, the red sox haven't been 0-6 since 1945. but in francona's eight seasons as their manager, they've had a winning record after six games just once and still won two world series. in 2009, they had two six-game losing streaks and reached the playoffs. besides, the red sox are only 4 1/2 games out of first place in the al east with 156 games left. and they picked up two of baseball's top position players in the offseason, first baseman adrian gonzalez (notes) and left fielder <mark>carl crawford</mark> (notes). gonzalez has been the lone bright spot in the batting order with a .350 average, one homer and five rbis. only two other players-ortiz and dustin pedroia (notes) - are batting above .250, and the red sox have been outscored 38-16 in sweeps at texas and cleveland. but with a 10-game homestand, they're optimistic they can turn that around. \"we've got great fans on our side,\" said youkilis, who is batting .133 with one rbi and two hits in 15 at-bats. \"we thrive on them and they thrive on us .? we've got a good team. we've just got to get out of this little funk we're in .\" we're frustrated as hell because we never thought we'd be here, but we are here, so you've got to deal with it. \"the yankees enter the series with a 4-2 record. but they know that one week, no matter how well or poorly a team plays, hardly indicates how it will finish the season .\" who cares if they're 0-6 or 6-0? \"new york reliever joba chamberlain (notes) said .\" they're still a talented ballclub. and we know that. we're not looking at their record. we're looking at the talent they're putting on the field that we're going to have to face. we're not playing their record. we're playing their team. \"derek jeter (notes) put it more simply:\" i think a lot of times people pay too much attention to the first week of the season. \"still, that week has been filled with poor hitting and starting pitching, fielding and running gaffes and relievers who can't find the plate. in wednesday's 8-4 loss to the indians, dennys reyes (notes) came out of the bullpen and threw 12 pitches, 11 of them balls and two that hit batters. dan wheeler (notes) relieved him with the bases loaded and got michael brantley (notes) to line to third baseman youkilis, who dropped the ball. youkilis stepped on third for the forceout then threw to catcher jason varitek (notes), who assumed the force was still in effect and stepped on the plate but didn't tag travis buck (notes), who scored .\" it was totally my fault, \"the red sox captain and 15-year veteran said. on thursday, <mark>darnell mcdonald</mark> (notes) pinch ran after <mark>ortiz</mark> walked with two outs in the ninth and cleveland leading 1-0. j.d. drew (notes) then hit the ball off pitcher <mark>chris perez</mark>'s (notes) leg for a single. but third baseman adam everett (notes) fielded it and, when <mark>mcdonald</mark> rounded second and slipped trying to get back, threw there for the final out .\" we've got to put ourselves in a better position that when somebody does slip, it doesn't cost us the chance for a game, \"francona said. the miserable start is disappointing to francona, but it hasn't wiped out his sense of humor. on thursday morning, when the red sox were still 0-5, he was asked if the team can feed off the fenway crowd's energy .\" i had 12 pieces of bacon this morning, \"he said .\" i'm going to feed off that. \"now they're 0-6-two pieces for every loss .\" this, \"francona said,\" hasn't been a real kind road trip. \"you can send a story to multiple email addresses by separating the email addresses with a semicolon

line that could run immediately east of the city, delivering power to the industrial heartland. the city wants to see the line buried, warning of possible health impacts, poor esthetics and the potential for nearby property values to drop. the towers could be up to 24 stories high. \"one of the names that this is being called is the mother of all power lines, because? 24-stories outside your backyard is not something attractive, to say the least,\" coun. <mark>karen leibovici</mark> told a news conference friday. the proposal, a joint venture between epcor and and altalink called the heartland transmission project, is slated to go before the alberta utilities commission (auc) monday. the hearing, which will hear from one of the city's lawyers, is expected to run into may. the 65 km power line would deliver electricity from south edmonton to industrial users northeast of edmonton, running along the eastern portion of the transportation utility corridor. the project would cost about $580 million if the lines are above ground, nearly doubling to $1.1 billion if a portion is buried, said tim le riche, spokesman for the project. \"we've gone through an extensive public consultation,\" said le riche, noting there was contact with over 200,000 stakeholders. \"after gathering all of the information, we have determined that when all factors are considered, it is our position that the best option, with the overall least impact, is an overhead line .\" however, the group has included information to the auc about burying a portion of the line, he said. epcor and altalink have countered claims of potential health risks and significantly lower property values. if the line is not buried, the city wants it to run along a second proposed route, immediately west of the city, through parkland and sturgeon counties. accused killer mark twitchell's \"lies' fire on 118 avenue near 94 street ivivva athletica to open at edmonton??? s southgate centre zig-zagging with
