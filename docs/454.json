At week's end, Delaware's media, political, and academic establishments were still rocked by that homicide-suicide in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania. So many folks knew Meredith Chapman. And, as we've learned, homicide-suicides perpetrated by women are quite rare. Looks like Delaware's three casinos could be on track to get a tax break to keep them viable. At least, the state Senate finance committee has okayed a measure to reduce taxes and fees; it remains to be seen if this package will clear the legislature. I realize jobs are on the line, but casinos are no panacea for jobs, as even some very impoverished places--such as Tunica County, Mississippi--have discovered. Casinos are no elixir. In fact, with all kinds of gambling, we have an oversaturation of casinos. Just look at Atlantic City. So would Delaware lawmakers be throwing good money after bad? And let's not forget the ugly social costs from all this gambling. From casinos to state lotteries, a charlatan's way to raise revenue. That task force that reviewed the pros and cons of consolidating school districts in Delaware decides consolidation is not the way to go. No matter the calls to talk-shows and letters to the editor of newspapers. The benefits of consolidation are also illusory. It's interesting how many of the proponents of consolidation also somehow favor charter schools, which require principals, assistant principals, and, of course, buildings. Can't people comprehend the inherent contradiction? Not to mention making a school board and superintendent even more remote from the general community? I happen to come from a part of the country (suburban Chicago), where each village or town generally has its own school board and administrators for the elementary schools (K-8). But the high schools come under the township level, with their separate school boards and administrators. Could you imagine? Yet, because the public schools enjoy widespread public support in most cases--with hardly any competition from Catholic or other private schools--you don't hear all that consolidation talk. Even with much higher property taxes. Consolidation is also not some elixir. During the \"Susan Monday Show\" this (Friday) morning, I heard Susan and callers debate whether President <mark>Trump</mark> should get most of the credit for the two Koreas seemingly come together. Not so fast. From my analysis, such talk is unrealistically premature. What good is a vague North Korean pledge to denuclearize? People have short memories. We've seen this before. Arguably, North Korea's dictator <mark>Kim Jong-Un</mark> is just trying to detach South Korea from its U.S. alliance. Arguably, Pyongyang has set a trap for President <mark>Trump</mark>. Has \"Rocket Man\" not pulled out the rug from underneath President <mark>Trump</mark>? Because if President <mark>Trump</mark>, in a summit, cannot win intense verifiable inspections of North Korea's nukes - and he withdraws from any talks, or even again threatens North Korea--Mr. <mark>Trump</mark> comes off looking like the global bully. From The Guardian...And a reality check from The Asia Times...Yet, clearly, in South Korea, at least some people are optimistic, given all the hopeful visual symbolism. But again, this could serve to detach South Korea's interests from America's. From The Korea Times of Seoul...Yet, there's something to the argument that President <mark>Trump</mark>'s \"Crazy-like-a-Fox\" posture brought North Korean leader <mark>Kim Jong-Un</mark> to the negotiating table. From Australia's Melbourne Age...Still, one can't help but think: Either this unorthodox President has achieved a great breakthrough precisely because he's avoided all the usual diplomatic niceties, or he's fallen into the same trap as all his predecessors, but doesn't even realize it yet. From The Atlantic...Of course, the buzz has begun: <mark>Donald Trump</mark> for the Nobel Peace Prize! From New York Magazine...I continue to believe the <mark>Trump</mark> Administration is toxic for nearly all who serve in it. Almost everyone who serves comes out diminished or degraded. This analysis from Politico Magazine...Also, from Politico Magazine: \"The Puzzle of Sarah Huckabee Sanders\" Article continues below advertisement Remember so-called \"Freedom Fries\" (in response to France's opposition to the proposed second invasion of Iraq, in 2003)? That seems so long ago, when many Americans were enraged with France. Now, France has arguably eclipsed Britain and Germany as a top international player with the U.S., following French President Macron's state visit to Washington. The Germans certainly are aware. From Spiegel...What is so ironic is that the French President's speech to Congress was, in so many ways, a sharp rebuke to Trumpism.

In collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of New York and the Costume Institute, this year's theme will be \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Image .\" Rihanna is one of the most fitting choices we can imagine to host, as she's attended the gala as far back as 2007, skipping a few in between to amount to a total of seven appearances on NYC red carpet. As one of the biggest nights of the year when it comes to fashion, we can't wait to see how all in attendance--especially Rihanna herself--will interpret the religiously-pointed theme. 11 years ago, 19-year-old Rihanna hit the red carpet for her first ever Met Gala in a Georges Chakra dress that was understated and simple, despite some embellishment on top. Since then, she's only risen further and further up the fashion-statement totem pole, consistently topping the best-dressed list and being one of the few celebrities on the red carpet to nail the theme each year.

Decker, 72, was a pretty good weekend golfer with scores below 100 and playing two or three times a week. Then his shoulder started hurting and he was hitting the ball 15 yards short. \"Then I hit one too many...and I hurt it more. Then a tried taking another and I just couldn't do it,\" he recalled. That was late last year. He had torn his rotator cuff. Surgery was Jan. 19. Now he can barely raise his left arm above his shoulder and his surgeon doesn't want him playing golf for several more months. \"So I can't swing yet. I can't play,\" he said. As to what his game will be like when he takes up golf again next year? \"I don't know,\" said the former assistant warden from the federal prison system, shaking his head. To give himself the best chance of being able to play again, though, Decker and 32 other golfers attended a recent presentation at the Citrus County YMCA hosted by Citrus Memorial Hospital's rehabilitation program. The program offers physical rehabilitation with a focus on getting your golf game back as we age or recover from surgery or injury. About 40,000 Americans opt for rotator-cuff surgery every year, but more than half don't return to normal use of their arm if they've had a large tear, according to an Orthopaedic Research Institute study done in Australia. Decker is recovering from a bad tear. Physical therapist Fred Shirley told the group of mostly seniors that the hospital's program works like most other rehabilitation strategies, but with the goal that the patient wants to golf again or improve their game. Shirley uses a Blast Motion cell phone app that video records the patient's golf swing. The program also includes a small sensor placed on the handle of the club that records swing velocity along each point in the swing. The rehabilitation focuses on injuries that cause golfers to swing incorrectly or changes in their swing due to surgeries. He said the therapy is useful whether the patient is still recovering from surgery or an injury and not yet back playing golf again. It's also good for patients back at the game but not playing up to par. Shirley said that while he's not a great golfer, that's not important in this therapy program. \"I look at everything from a biomedical (perspective) and I'm looking for balance,\" Shirley said. The problem is that during the healing period, golfers often pick up bad habits to compensate for their injuries or surgeries, he said. \"And that drastically changes your swing,\" he said. And even when the injury heals or the surgery site recovers, those bad habits remain, he told the golfers. \"That's where I come in,\" he said. Shirley analyzes the swing and then gets to work building the patient's strength in the right areas and ending unwanted compensation. In many cases health insurance will pay for the rehabilitation when there is a legitimate injury or when the patient is recovering from surgery, Shirley said. Shirley works out of Citrus Memorial's Crystal River rehabilitation location. Decker and others like him are good candidates for the program, Shirley said. \"The habits he's picking up now are ones we can eliminate before they become really difficult to get rid of,\" Shirley said. Ale Denton is an 80-year-old retired postman. He also came to the event. It's not the surgeries that have slowed his golf game down, Denton said, but rather the natural progression of age. \"I was never really that good,\" Denton said, \"but maybe I can be better .\" He wants Shirley to help with that. Shirley told the group that most people can't hit the ball as far as they could 20 years ago, so analyzing a player's swing as they age and then strengthening where they can would help most players, Shirley said. <mark>David Reed</mark> is the YMCA's operations director and an avid golfer. He lent Citrus Memorial Hospital the YMCA room for the presentation because there are many golfers here enjoying Citrus County's more than a dozen golf courses. \"Golf is a sport; a community,\" <mark>Reed</mark> said. \"People respect the game of golf. It brings people together .\" Katie Myers, Citrus Memorial's director of marketing and public relations, said that all of the hospital's physical therapists enjoy specializing in one kind of rehabilitation in addition to traditional therapy. \"Fred's really honed in on something that's near and dear to him,\" Myers said. \"People don't realize how much that they do during their daily lives that can be helped with physical therapy,\" she said, \"and that includes golf .\" Golf is such an important aspect of our community, \"she said,\" and Citrus Memorial wants people to continue to do what they love. \"People interested in contacting Shirley can reach him at 352-563-0030.

His attorneys did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages. Nielsen was salon director at several hotels developed and built by Wynn, including Bellagio, Wynn Las Vegas and Encore. Nielsen told the Journal that he and other employees informed company executives about sexual advances by Wynn, but no action was taken. Wynn denies the allegations. In a statement Monday, his attorney Lin Wood referred to a \"media frenzy\" surrounding the initial reporting of accusations against Wynn. Wood noted that the filing against Nielsen was the third defamation lawsuit by Wynn recent weeks.
