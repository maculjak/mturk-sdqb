Debbie Reynolds Carrie Fisher While nothing has been finalized just yet, E! News has learned that discussions are currently underway to determine what is the best way to honor two talented ladies. According to <mark>Todd Fisher</mark>, a joint funeral has been discussed but is not official. \"That is my preference,\" he shared with E! News. \"Obviously it's not finalized, but I think that sounds like a grand idea given the beautiful story between them.\" In only a matter of months, both Debbie and Carrie were set to star in the HBO documentary, Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher.

News that HBO reached out and both parties hope the documentary can be a part of the memorial in some way. \"Remarkably enough, the [Bright Lights] documentary is the greatest tribute you can imagine to both of them,\" <mark>Todd</mark> shared. As planning continues, The Los Angeles Coroner's Office confirmed to E! News Thursday afternoon that Carrie's body is in their possession and that the autopsy is on hold due to the \"family's loss for two.\" \"We're not out to rush the family,\" the office shared with us. \"We're giving the family some space. They not only lost Carrie, but lost Debbie too.\" As the tributes continue pouring in from fans and celebrities alike, <mark>Todd</mark> revealed that many of Carrie's Star Wars co-stars have reached out. And while many of the tributes will remain private, some family members can't help but express some of their emotions on social media. \"This is a beautiful love story to witness in my 58 years,\" <mark>Todd</mark> wrote on Twitter with a drawing of a mother and daughter. \"I miss them both so much.

Thornton Arkansas receiver Jared Cornelius is tackled during a game against Tennessee-Martin on Saturday, Oct. 31, 2015, at Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville. FAYETTEVILLE--Six weeks after Arkansas receiver Jared Cornelius suffered two fractures in his left arm, the sophomore was back catching passes and punts Saturday in the Razorbacks' 63-28 victory over Tennessee-Martin. More from WholeHogSports UA football trailblazer dies \"I thought I was out for the season for sure,\" Cornelius said of the injury he sustained when he was tackled against Texas Tech on Sept. 19. \"The training staff did a wonderful job of starting me at zero and working my way back. We were just really aggressive with it and didn't baby it that much coning back.\" Cornelius had 4 catches for 33 yards and a 33-yard punt return. \"I was just trying to get back into the offense,\" he said. \"I felt a little rust here and there. I ran a couple routes that were wrong.\" Arkansas Coach Bret Bielema said he was surprised by how well Cornelius played. \"You're always concerned when someone has been sitting out for so long, but he's been able to practice the last couple of weeks fairly well,\" Bielema said. \"Even when he wasn't officially cleared to play in a game, he'd been catching balls in team periods.\" Arkansas resumes SEC play at Ole Miss next week. \"I'm ready to go,\" Cornelius said. \"This game was kind of to move me back into the offense. Now that SEC play is here I've got to step it up.\" Injury report Arkansas receiver Drew Morgan left the game in the second half to have a shoulder injury evaluated, but Coach Bret Bielema said it was more of a precautionary move and Morgan should be ready to play at Ole Miss.. Bielema said Morgan injured the shoulder earlier this season and aggravated it Saturday. \"It was good for us to get him out of there,\" Bielema said. Cornerback Jared Collins sat out the game because of what Bielema called a \"turf toe\" injury. Bielema said he expects Collins to return to practice Tuesday. Starting offensive tackle Dan Skipper missed a few plays because of an apparent right arm injury, but he returned to the game. He had ice on his arm during the fourth quarter when the backups were playing. Fullback Kendrick Jackson played Saturday after missing last week's game against Auburn because of a concussion. Tailback Rawleigh Williams, who underwent season-ending neck surgery last week, watched Saturday's game from the Arkansas sideline. He wore a neck brace but was smiling as he walked off the field. Ramirez misses game Arkansas backup free safety Santos Ramirez missed the game for an undisclosed disciplinary reason. \"We made a decision this week he wasn't going to be with us,\" Coach Bret Bielema said. \"He will be full go next week.\" 2 Hogs released Bret Bielema said receivers Jojo Robinson and Kendrick Edwards are no longer on the team and have been given their scholarship releases so they can find new schools. Bielema said he won't release them to sign with teams the Razorbacks are playing in the future. \"The good news is they've got five official visits to take a look at some other programs,\" Bielema said. \"We'll do everything we can to help them so their story ends positive.\" Bielema has said previously Robinson and Edwards have been suspended for missing classes to the extent that it jeopardizes their eligibility at Arkansas. Senior award for Allen Arkansas quarterback <mark>Brandon Allen</mark> received the Crip Hall Award, as voted on by the media, for being the team's outstanding senior in the homecoming game. Allen completed 14 of 19 passes for 265 yards and 2 touchdowns without an interception. Pulley starts Freshman cornerback Ryan Pulley made his first career start and played throughout the first half. He started in place of junior D.J. Dean, who sat out because of a toe injury. In the third quarter nickel back Henre Toliver moved over to the outside in place of Pulley and <mark>Kevin Richardson</mark> played at nickel back. Pulley was back at cornerback in the fourth quarter. Half a million Tennessee-Martin's guarantee from Arkansas for Saturday's game against the Razorbacks will be $500,000, according to the Union City (Tenn.) Daily Messenger. Many firsts The Razorbacks had a lot of firsts Saturday, including: \u2022 Damon \"Duwop\" Mitchell scoring the first touchdown for the Razorbacks when <mark>Brandon Allen</mark> connected with him on a 49-yard pass play. \u2022 Backup quarterback Austin Allen throwing his first touchdown pass, 35 yards to tight end Jeremy Sprinkle. \u2022 Tailback Juan Day getting his first carries and gaining 17 yards on 4 attempts. Flag bearers Alex Collins carried the U.S. flag and Matt Emrich carried the Arkansas flag when the Razorbacks ran onto the field before kickoff. Benny back Former Arkansas center fielder Andrew Benintendi, who helped lead the Razorbacks to the College World Series last season, was presented with the Golden Spikes Award on the field during a break in the first quarter. The Golden Spikes Award was among several national honors of Benintendi, who also won the Dick Howser Trophy and was named player of the year by Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball magazines. Benintendi is playing in the minor leagues for the Boston Red Sox, who made him the seventh overall pick in last year's draft. Playing 54 games for Class A Short Season Lowell (Mass.) and Class A Greenville (S.C.) last season, Benintendi hit .313 with 11 home runs and 31 run batted in. High five Five former Razorbacks who were NFL Draft picks watched the game from the sideline: Trey Flowers, Martrell Spaight, Chris Gragg, Tevin Mitchel and Kiero Small. Flowers (New England), Spaight (Washington), Gragg (Buffalo) and Mitchel (Indianapolis) are with teams this season. Spaight and Mitchel are on injured reserve.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) | Photo: AP Updated: December 24, 2019 08:01 AM Created: December 24, 2019 07:53 AM New York (AP) - Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will resign from the board next week, effectively severing ties with the ride-hailing company he co-founded a decade ago. Uber turbocharged the gig economy and since 2010 has logged 15 billion trips. Kalanick was ousted as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in numerous lawsuits. Advertisement The departure did not come as a surprise. Kalanick recently sold more than $2.5 billion worth of shares in the company, more than 90% of his holdings. \"Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,\" Kalanick said in a prepared statement Tuesday. \"I'm proud of all that Uber has achieved, and I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines.\" Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, the company ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be reeling out of control. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick calls Fowler's accusations \"abhorrent\" and hires former U.S. Attorney General <mark>Eric Holder</mark> to investigate. Days later, Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that Anthony Levandowski - a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project - stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division. Then, The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's use of the Greyball software.

Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of tech giant Huawei and eldest daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud. Meng made no comment as she rushed past journalists and protesters waving \"Free Meng\" and \"Trump stop bullying us\" placards outside the British Columbia Supreme Court. Her husband and Chinese consular officials sat in a packed gallery to watch the proceedings. In order to secure her freedom, Meng, known as the \"princess of Huawei,\" must convince a Canadian judge that the US charges--linked to alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran--would not stand up in Canada and are politically motivated. The US alleges Meng lied to HSBC Bank about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. \"Simply put, there is evidence she deceived HSBC in order to induce it to continue to provide banking services to Huawei,\" the Canadian justice department said in court filings. Meng has denied the allegations. She has been out on bail, living in one of her two Vancouver mansions for the past year. Earlier, China's foreign ministry called Meng's extradition case a \"grave political incident\" and urged Ottawa to release the Huawei executive in order to normalise relations. \"The US and Canada are abusing their bilateral extradition treaty,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a regular press briefing in Beijing. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Ottawa would not interfere in the case, adding that Canada \"honours its extradition treaty commitments.\" The Canadian justice department has said it will justify extradition by arguing that the US accusations against Meng would be considered a crime in Canada if they had occurred there--a key test known as double criminality. Her lawyers, however, will counter that misrepresentations, if they occurred, do not amount to fraud, and that Canada has not matched the US sanctions against Iran. \"Sanctions drive this case,\" lead defence lawyer <mark>Richard Peck</mark> said in an opening statement. \"This case is founded on allegations of breach of US sanctions, which Canada has repudiated,\" he said. \"The US has cast (Meng's) alleged behaviour as a fraud against a bank. This is an artifice,\" <mark>Peck</mark> said. Canada is effectively being asked \"to enforce US sanctions.\" Caught up in US-China row Meng's arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 put the 47-year-old at the centre of the US and China's battle over the technology giant's growing global reach. It also stuck Canada in the middle of a trade row between the world's two largest economies, resulting in China restricting agricultural imports from Canada. In addition, China arrested two Canadians on what Canada said were vague and trumped-up charges of \"harming national security.\" China's \"arbitrary detentions,\" according to Ottawa, of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, only days after Meng was taken into custody, have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. The hearing in Vancouver is scheduled to last five days. But if the US accusations are found to also be a crime in Canada, a further phase will follow in June, with the defense arguing that authorities conspired to nab Meng as part of a \"covert criminal investigation.\" In court documents, Canadian prosecutors assert that Huawei controlled the operations of Skycom in Iran; that its staff used Huawei email accounts and security badges, and its bank accounts were controlled by Huawei. But Meng told HSBC executives in a presentation in 2013 that Huawei no longer owned Skycom and that she had resigned from that company's board. From 2010 to 2014, HSBC and its American subsidiary cleared more than US $100 million worth of transactions related to Skycom through the US. Stunting Huawei's rise Ren Zhengfei has suggested that the case is part of a US plot to crush Huawei, which it sees as a security risk. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had hoped when he came to power in 2015 to deepen Canada's economic ties with China, earlier asked the US for help. He told broadcaster TVA last month that he urged US President Donald Trump not to finalise a trade deal with China \"that doesn't settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.\" Trump went ahead, however, and signed a \"phase one\" trade deal with China last week. Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien and his ex-deputy <mark>John Manley</mark> have urged Trudeau to simply release Meng in a \"prisoner swap\" for Spavor and Kovrig to help restore relations with China. But extradition experts consulted by AFP argued that that would encourage what some called Beijing's \"hostage diplomacy\" tactics .--AFP"}, {"articleID": "2017112306_00162282_W", "names": {"Joe Barton": ["Q6208505", "Q966261"]}, "date": "2017-11-23", "url": "http://www.wbt.com/articles/ap-news/report-rep-joe-barton-threatened-ex-lover-police", "content": "Report: Rep. <mark>Joe Barton</mark> threatened ex-lover with police The Chris Ferrell Show, seg1 11/18/17 November 18, 2017 FILE - In this June 14, 2017, file photo, Rep. <mark>Joe Barton</mark>, R-Texas, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, about the incident where House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of La., and others, were shot during a Congressional baseball practice. <mark>Barton</mark> is apologizing after a nude photo of him circulated on social media. <mark>Barton</mark> released a statement on Nov. 22 to the Texas Tribune acknowledging that while separated from his second wife, prior to their divorce, he had sexual relationships \"with other mature adult women.\" (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) Report: Rep. <mark>Joe Barton</mark> threatened ex-lover with police November 23, 2017 - 12:10 am Categories: News DALLAS (AP)--U.S. Rep. <mark>Joe Barton</mark> told a woman that he would complain to U.S. Capitol Police if sexually explicit photographs of him and other material from their relationship were to be exposed publicly, according to a published report. The Washington Post reported the threat Wednesday after <mark>Barton</mark>, a North Texas Republican, apologized for a nude photo of him that circulated on social media. The photo of <mark>Barton</mark> appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. It was not immediately known who posted the photo or when it was taken. <mark>Barton</mark> issued a statement saying that while separated from his second wife, prior to their divorce in 2015, he had sexual relationships \"with other mature adult women.\" The 68-year-old Republican said each relationship was consensual and has since ended. \"I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down,\" said <mark>Barton</mark>, the longest-serving member of Congress from Texas.

She also shared with the Post a secretly recorded telephone conversation with <mark>Barton</mark> in 2015 in which he warned her against using the material \"in a way that would negatively affect my career.\" The Post reported the woman, who is not married, spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy. A message left by The Associated Press at <mark>Barton</mark>'s district office in Arlington, Texas, was not returned. The voicemail for his office in Washington was full. In a statement to the Post, <mark>Barton</mark> said a transcript of the telephone conversation provided by the newspaper may be \"evidence\" of a \"potential crime against me.\" He also said that Capitol Police had informed him Wednesday that they were opening an inquiry. Capitol Police did not respond to a request by the AP for comment late Wednesday.

"content": "Pochettino confident <mark>Kane</mark> will be fit for England 2017-11-06 14:35 Khune out injured with facial fracture London - Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino insists <mark>Harry Kane</mark> will be available for England's upcoming friendly internationals despite an injury scare in a 1-0 Premier League win over Crystal Palace. The Spurs striker went off 14 minutes from the end of Sunday's success at Wembley after receiving treatment in the first half. Pochettino also believes Dele Alli will recover from a hamstring problem in time for his club's next game with north London rivals Arsenal, even if he is missing England duty for the matches with Germany and Brazil. But he was unsure whether Harry Winks will have to withdraw from Gareth Southgate's squad after the midfielder went off with an ankle injury in a below-par victory where Spurs failed to hit the heights of their thrilling midweek 3-1 success over Real Madrid in the Champions League. \"<mark>Kane</mark> was subbed because after 75 minutes we wanted to protect him,\" said Pochettino. \"After Real Madrid it was such an emotional game, it was better to avoid risk. I think he's OK and I'm sure he will go with the international team.\" The former Southampton manager added: \"Harry Winks twisted his ankle in the first half, it's a little bit painful, we must assess him with our medical staff and the national team medical staff.\" He is so excited to be with the national side but now it is up to the medical staff to assess the player. \"Dele felt his tendon at the end of the Manchester United game close to his hamstring and then played 90 minutes against Real Madrid. It is a very small thing. It was not a massive risk to play him here and we hope he can be ready for Arsenal.\" Spurs were disappointing against Palace in a match where the deadlock was not broken until the 64th minute thanks to Son Heung-Min's 20-yard drive. \"It was very difficult,\" admitted Pochettino. \"We knew after Real Madrid it would be a massive challenge to compete again. In the end I'm very pleased, the team was very professional.\" It was a game where we had possession and dominated but we conceded a lot of chances. You need some luck to win and it was a good performance. \"\"Deserved more' Palace remain bottom and are five points from safety but the Eagles can feel aggrieved with Wilfried Zaha missing their best chance when he fired wide at 0-0 after rounding debutant goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga.\" I will be leaving Wembley as a loser, which didn't happen much when I was here for four years, \"said Palace's former England manager Roy Hodgson.\" We created chances and had moments where we were even on top against an illustrious side. We deserved more than what we had. \"But in football you get what you get. You don't get what some people think you deserve.\" Hodgson added: \"We look at the table and we are still on four points. But globally there is not a lot I can accuse my players of. The confidence is fragile but when the goal went in we could have collapsed and lose by three or four.\" They (Tottenham) have players who can punish you. That's a positive they didn't. \""}, {"articleID": "2009042207_00060126_W", "names": {"Dave Davies": ["Q364890", "Q5228642"]}, "date": "2009-04-22", "url": "http://philly.com/r?19=961&43=165761&44=43408742&32=3796&7=195202&40=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.philly.com%2Fphilly%2Fnews%2F20090422_Butkovitz__City_could_save___with__tele-nurse_.html", "content": "posted on wed, apr. 22, 2009 butkovitz: city could save $with \"tele-nurse' by <mark>dave davies</mark> philadelphia daily news a city controller's report recommends that the city take some pressure off its 9-1-1 emergency system by routing noncritical calls to a\" tele-nurse \"who could dispense medical advice and recommend alternatives to an ambulance run. controller alan butkovitz says three other cities that employ the technique were able to reduce their ambulance trips by about 8 percent. tele-nurses in those cities assist in arranging doctor's appointments and alternate transportation, including taxis and paratransit.\" the biggest benefit would be saving lives because all 9-1-1 fire and medical emergency calls would be prioritized, and as a result more ems units would be available to respond to all critical emergencies, \"butkovitz said. if philadelphia's experience were similar to that of houston, seattle and richmond, he said, the city could avoid as many as 18,000 ambulance runs a year and save about $2.5 million. butkovitz said that many callers would be better served by tele-nurses.\" people want help, and if they feel there's somebody at the other end of the line that's helping them, why would they want to get into an ambulance and wait for hours at an emergency room? \"he said. the controller's study said that if the city adopted the program, it would have to think carefully about quality-control and liability issues. butkovitz said that he'll present the report to the fire department, which operates the 9-1-1 system. fire officials couldn't be reached for comment on the proposal late yesterday. david kearney, a veteran paramedic who is recording secretary of the firefighters union which represents ems personnel, said that he's interested in the idea. because your contributions are currently under review, no comments can be made at this time. philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations. please treat other participants with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated. you are responsible for what you say. and please, stay on topic. if you see an objectionable post, please report it to us using the\" report abuse \"button. about your comments: these comments are monitored by philly.com staff. we reserve the right at all times to remove any information or materials that are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable. personal attacks, especially on other participants, are not permitted. we reserve the right to permanently block any user who violates these terms and conditions. according to our terms of service, you are not yet of legal age to be able to contribute to this site. thank you for registering! please note that your registration will not be considered fully complete until you confirm by following the link we have provided in a confirmation email that was just sent to"}, {"articleID": "2018060903_00107510_W", "names": {"Roger E.

[1] Contents [show] Description Edit These statues were made from cherry wood and adorned with a large onyx. Unlike other spelljamming figureheads, which were carved in humanoid form, these took the shape of couatl. The wings of the statue would wrap around each side of the ship and the tail would dip beneath its prow. Each figurehead granted their ship a unique illusion. [1] Powers Edit When activated by the mage at the spelljammer's helm, figureheads of illusion could, once per day, create an illusory effect, altering the appearance of the ship. These images could be additional weaponry, larger and more numerous sails and armor or other such deceptive appearances. These illusions were non-functioning, but could be eliminated by contact, the spelljamming mage losing concentration or until dispelled.

(for different purposes, he also spoke at the memorial for shooting victims at fort hood and welcomed home the remains of troops at dover air base .) the vice president and the first lady, in turn, have made the rounds at half a dozen other facilities. presidential addresses to the uniformed military were relatively rare before 2002, when bush went to west point for a june 1 speech to the cadets detailing the doctrine of preemptive war. had sarah palin watched that speech, she would have avoided four of the most damaging words of the 2008 presidential campaign, uttered when abc news's charlie gibson asked whether she agreed with the bush doctrine: \"in what sense, charlie?\" in the last days of his presidency, bush returned to west point for another speech, reminding everybody about his forgotten doctrine. by then, he had delivered dozens of speeches before crowds of soldiers and sailors under his command. at eglin air force base in florida, he wore a bomber jacket and used air force one as his backdrop. at macdill air force base in florida, he appeared in a hangar with fighter jets, flags, military banners and troops. then, of course, came the aircraft carrier landing on an s-3b viking, for which bush trained in the white house swimming pool, and the premature \"mission accomplished\" banner. on and on went the speeches to the troops: wright-patterson air force base, the army war college, national defense university, fort hood, fort bragg, the air force academy. even his second inauguration, in 2005, served as a vehicle for bush to surround himself with all things military. as the televised speeches to military audiences became more frequent, so did the complaints of the opposition, which questioned the propriety of bush attacking democrats in front of the troops, who are not allowed to participate in political events while in uniform. predictably, the cry was picked up by the right after obama took office and continued the practice of speeches to the troops. two weeks ago, fox news's <mark>glenn beck</mark> played an image of obama speaking in front of uniformed soldiers and complained: \"i'm sick of it, especially when it comes to the soldiers. they are not props.\" but they are required to be loyal, and when their commander in chief talks, whether it's bush or obama, they salute. or applaud. or yell \"hoo-ah.\" and on tuesday night, this military pageantry will only compound the sense on the left that obama is not the man they thought he was. in an open letter to obama on his web site monday, liberal activist <mark>michael moore</mark> wrote that by increasing troops in afghanistan, \"you will do the worst possible thing you could do--destroy the hopes and dreams so many millions have placed in you.\" \"with just one speech tomorrow night,\" <mark>moore</mark> continued, \"you will turn a multitude of young people who were the backbone of your campaign into disillusioned cynics. you will teach them what they've always heard is true--that all politicians are alike.\" post partisan quick takes from the post's opinion writers. washington sketch dana milbank writes about political theater in the capital."}]
