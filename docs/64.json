a scabbard became a fancy wand and with his father's old pair of glasses (with the lenses taken out) and a mascara lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, he was ready. he went to school, practicing saying \"expelliarmus!\" under his breath. at the bus stop, there was a fantastic mr fox, another harry potter, a willy wonka and a few more roald dahl characters. but what i couldn't guess what character a girl the same age as my son, wearing a funky version of her school uniform, with her tie askew and a lurid short skirt over a pair of black tights, was. i quizzed her mother and got the answer that the girl was a st trinian's school girl. \"ah!\" , said i. \"yeah, she rejected the white witch cos it wasn't cool enough\" , completed the mum. this is what has come down too - relative

while france's anti-terrorism police interrogated one suspect and tried to track down at least one other assailant who escaped. the shooting tuesday of a 53-year-old officer outside paris marked the first time eta has killed a member of the french police, spanish media said. eta has traditionally used france as a refuge and a staging ground for attacks in spain. french police have been cracking down on members hiding out in france, and the shooting came soon after the group's suspected leader was arrested here. \"france has paid a high price for its help against eta,\" spanish prime minister <mark>jose luis rodriguez</mark> zapatero said at an impromptu news conference. a former eta member said the police killing in the eastern paris suburb of dammarie-les-lys did not appear to be a calculated shift in eta strategy--willful violence in a country long spared the type of attacks waged across the border. rather, he said, it seemed to result from on-the-spot thinking by a unit confronted by police. he said eta crossed a line it had avoided until now by killing a member of french security forces. france may react with a crackdown, and eta might be forced to keep an even lower profile for a while, said the former eta member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the case. it was the first killing this year blamed on eta. the last one was a car bomb that killed two civil guards in july on the spanish mediterranean island of mallorca. the exact circumstances of the shooting were still unclear. one french police official said the suspected eta commando unit was allegedly trying to steal cars tuesday when it was surprised by police. the gunfight started after four officers approached a suspicious vehicle near a used car dealership in dammarie-les-lys, he said. one of the suspects opened fire on the officer, who was hit by two bullets and died soon afterward, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with department policy. the suspect being questioned was a spanish basque wanted on a european arrest warrant issued by authorities in spain, the police official said. officials were analyzing his weapon to see if it was the gun used to kill the officer. authorities were still searching for at least one other suspect. eta's alleged leader was arrested in france on feb. 28. ibon gogeascoechea and two other suspected eta members had been hiding out in a cottage rented with false identity papers when they were apprehended. gogeascoechea was the fifth eta leader arrested in spain or france since may 2008. although this is first killing of a french policeman blamed on eta, the group has been involved in shootouts with french security forces at least four times since 1988, and four french police officers have been wounded, the spanish newspaper el pais reported. so far this year, 34 eta members have been arrested: seven in france and the rest in spain, according to the spanish interior ministry. the figure includes the detainee in the policeman's killing. the spanish prime minister said he planned to speak with french president nicolas sarkozy and expressed his condolences to the family of the slain officer. his comments were the first official ones in spain or france linking eta to the shooting. zapatero pledged that spain and france will \"maintain a relentless fight against the criminals of the terrorist gang eta .\" eta has killed more than 825 people since the late 1960s in its campaign for an independent basque state in northern spain and southwestern france

deer, but people are spooked. in late february, a single whitetail buck in central missouri tested positive for chronic wasting disease, a contagious, fatal brain infection. it was the state's first-ever case, found in one animal among the state's estimated 1.4 million deer. the discovery prompted a swift reaction. state and federal officials, preparing for this moment in missouri for years, quickly quarantined the high-fence shooting ranch in linn county where the sick deer was found. they hoped to quell the outbreak before it spread unchecked in the wild. \"we have to be aggressive,\" state veterinarian taylor woods said. \"this all boils down to credibility .\" outside the fence, worry consumed the people who breed deer and run hunting lodges - part of an estimated $4 billion a year industry in the united states. oklahoma closed its borders to missouri deer. so did illinois. then louisiana and indiana. one by one, states refused entry permits to people seeking to import deer from missouri. all because of one buck. \"it's sickening, the panic. what am i going to do?\" said <mark>david wood</mark>, who has been unable to move any deer from his breeding farm in linn county, mo., since the outbreak. afflicted deer eventually stagger, grind teeth and starve before death. but most of the animals now being discovered with the disease are outwardly healthy. researchers and industry officials say this is because they are looking more closely for outbreaks. although testing cannot be done on live animals, many states test dead animals. illinois found the disease in a single wild deer in 2002. kansas found it first in 2006, and again last week with 10 deer testing positive. \"if you do enough sampling, you're going to find it,\" said bill pittenger, head of the missouri whitetail breeders and hunting ranch association. missouri began its statewide surveillance for chronic wasting disease in 2002. it finally turned up at heartland wildlife ranches in ethel, mo., 200 miles northwest of st. louis. heartland is a high-end hunting operation, with a sprawling lodge set on 800 acres surrounded by 8-foot fences. hunters come from across the country to take aim at trophy animals such as whitetail deer, elk and zebra. a three-day hunt for water buffalo costs $4,000. the infected deer actually died last fall. months later, as part of the state's regular surveillance program, heartland sent a specimen sample along with other samples to a federal lab in iowa. on feb. 25, the test came back positive. \"i was disappointed. worried. surprised,\" said rob brasher of salt lake city, whose family has owned heartland for two decades. the positive test sent a shudder through missouri's 39 big-game hunting operations and 272 licensed deer breeders, whose operations provide hunters with so-called shooting bucks. the state's deer industry supports the testing program, pittenger said. but members also chafe at how regulators react to an outbreak. as one person complained on a deer hunter's message board, the disease \"is a lot like global warming,\" suggesting that the response was making the problem seem worse than it really is. but government officials say drastic actions are needed to halt the march of a little-understood disease. oklahoma's state veterinarian made no apologies for shutting out deer from missouri \"as soon as we found out\" about the positive test. \"because we don't have cwd in the state of oklahoma, we need to protect our cervid breeders and our native whitetail population,\" said dr. becky brewer. other states took similar action. most states, including oklahoma, have since eased those import restrictions to deer raised closer to heartland, either in a surrounding county or within a 25-mile radius. missouri officials are now trying to determine the size of the outbreak. the 4-year-old infected buck spent its entire life at heartland. the state agriculture department is running the investigation. last weekend, 50 deer were killed at heartland. specimens were sent for testing. results are expected friday or early next week. to see whether the infection jumped the fence line, another 150 wild deer are being culled in a five-mile radius around heartland by the state conservation department. \"it'll be interesting to see what comes with the second round of testing,\" said brasher, owner of heartland. but any test results - positive or negative - will be of little solace for <mark>wood</mark>, who runs the linn county deer farm just 17 miles from heartland. last year, the linneus, mo., machinist decided to step up his small breeding program. he said he spent his savings and borrowed some more to buy a sturdy buck and quality does. he knew it was a gamble. but a baby deer can sell for $4,000 to $8,000. some farmers have even turned to laparoscopic artificial insemination to generate deer herds. but after that one positive test, it no longer mattered that <mark>wood</mark> had taken part in the state's disease surveillance program since its inception. or that he de-wormed and vaccinated his deer. or that it would seem almost impossible for the infection to have spread to his animals. his deer farm was simply too close to heartland for cautious buyers and regulators. he was being blacklisted. \"there is no bright spot for me,\" he said. he thought about it for a moment.", "articleID": "2010031805_00003633_W", "names": {"David Wood": ["Q1631653", "Q18162769", "Q19003417", "Q21453240", "Q27909754", "Q3019012", "Q42610330", "Q5241272", "Q5241273", "Q5241275",
