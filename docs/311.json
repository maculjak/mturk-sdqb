[4] aang's crush on her was made explicit, while katara was told she will marry a powerful bender and had the appearance of an epiphany when sokka casually described aang as a powerful bender. crystal catacombs, his earthly attachment to katara prevented him from triggering the avatar state. after being shot down by azula and being revived by katara's spirit water, aang looked up at katara and smiled at her weakly, indicating that he had not truly given her up. invasion of the fire nation, aang kissed katara on the lips before leaving to find and battle fire lord ozai. [8] despite this, the two were not a couple; katara even refused aang's romantic advances during an intermission of the [9] however, they kissed passionately at the end of the series, [10] beginning a romantic relationship. it has been proven that aang and katara married in their later lives and had three children, including two sons by the names of katara and zuko - known as \"zutara conflict at tu zin, katara offered to help zuko heal his uncle's wound. [12] zuko and katara later happened to both be imprisoned in the same [14] she was able to forgive and start trusting him. soon after, they slowly became friends. when it was time for everyone to choose their own destiny, zuko enlisted katara's aid in facing azula. zuko actually saved katara's life by jumping in the way of azula's lighting bolt that was targeted for her. [16] their relationship never turned romantic. sokka and ty lee - known as\" ty lokka sokka at several points in the story. when she first met him, she commented to mai that he was \"kind of cute\". [12] when she met him a second time, she happily exclaimed, \"it is the avatar...and friends!\" with a special emphasis on sokka. kyoshi warriors, ty lee fought sokka in a fashion that prompted her to say, \"it's like we're dancing together!\" sokka pointed out that he was \"kind of involved with suki\". mai's smile at the thought of seeing zuko again, [18] maiko was one of the primary ships of the show. the two were childhood sweethearts, ember island that mai and zuko had trouble with one another's anger or apathy and split up. [8] mai interpreted this as him breaking up with her and, in a later confrontation, stated he had broken her heart. despite this, she betrayed azula to save him, saying, \"[23] moments before zuko's coronation, they reaffirmed their relationship with a hug and a kiss. jet and katara - known as\" jetara [24] however, when jet tricked katara into harming innocent people, she abandoned all loyalty to him and remained bitter toward him from then on. however, katara seemed uncomfortable and defensive when questioned about her relationship with him in ba sing se, and apparently considered jet her ex-boyfriend. any remaining chance of them becoming a couple was eliminated when jet died under long feng. [25] interestingly, jetara was commonly supported as a prelude to zutara, as it was claimed to be proof that katara liked \"bad boys\". it was also revealed on avatar extras that jet was katara's first kiss, though it was off screen. aang and toph - known as \"taang toph and aang had a close friendship throughout the series, although as actor sokka said, they had a\" rocky relationship \". [26] but did not meet toph until he, katara and sokka bought tickets to attend the earth rumble vi tournament. toph initially refused to join their group, but agreed when her father expressed his desire to hide and protect her even more. [27] proponents of the ship liked their nature as opposites. sokka and toph - known as\" tokka \", fans known as\" tokkans \"or, more commonly,\" tokkaneers \"- this ship was mostly based on the pair's deep friendship and, later on, toph's clear crush on sokka. explicit hints about her feelings for him began when toph was bitter about how he ran straight to suki instead of thanking her for saving his life. later on, when toph was drowning, sokka announced his intention to save her, only for suki to reach her first. toph, believing sokka rescued her, kissed suki on the cheek. [7] their friendship was later emphasized even more when toph blushed upon sokka's return from training with [31] later, they had a tender conversation when she had a falling out with katara. [29] during the final battle, sokka and toph worked together, at first with [16] after suki saved both of their lives, sokka remained in his relationship with suki. tokka was commonly shipped in tandem with kataang, as it provided romantic partners for all four members of team avatar. many tokka shippers\" abandoned ship \"after it was revealed that toph's daughter dated katara's son, as this would have meant the two would be cousins if sokka was lin's father. [32] toph and zuko - known as\" toko \"- toph was the first member of the group to accept zuko, encouraging the others to let him join team avatar. [13] they had a tender conversation, where zuko expressed concern about his actions toward [12] that he had probably already forgiven his nephew. when the team temporarily separated in an attempt to track down aang, toph immediately chose to accompany zuko, claiming that everyone else had gone on a\" life-changing field trip with zuko \", and it was therefore her turn. she clung to zuko's arm, causing him to blush. [33] their friendship made for a convenient fanon ship, as the complete team avatar (aang, katara, sokka, toph, zuko, suki) can be paired off among themselves as kataang, sukka, and toko. it should also be noted that toph stopped blushing about sokka around the same time zuko showed up, and hit his arm constantly, her way of showing affection. [9] any problems between the two usually resolved quickly, including the time zuko burned her feet. yue and sokka - known as\" yukka [36] she came to love him, too, but the two were kept apart due to yue's engagement to another warrior, [37] yue ultimately died when she gave up her life force to save the moon spirit tui, and was thus reincarnated as tui's successor. yue kissed sokka goodbye, promising she would always be with him. [38] sokka remained very upset about yue's sacrifice, believing he failed to protect her. [30] although he had since fallen in love with suki, sokka's love for yue remained very strong. [39] haru and katara - known as \"haru and katara was suggested after katara met haru in the forest near the mining village. when haru was arrested by the fire nation, katara tricked the fire nation into arresting her in order to save him, a task in which she succeeded. she and haru grew close after they confided their personal sadness due to the ongoing war to each other. [40] haru and katara have since remained good friends and fought by each other's side during the sokka and suki - known as\" ' sukka suki and sokka's relationship began when they first met each other on kyoshi warriors. however, suki showed him the error of his ways. she later kissed him on the cheek before he left kyoshi island. full moon bay, although there were some awkward moments for them. however, they parted again after sharing a passionate kiss. [30] suki was captured by mai, azula and ty lee shortly after, [42] so they did not meet again until sokka ventured the [43] later on, the two planned a romantic rendezvous in sokka's tent; however, it was comically interrupted when zuko approached sokka for advice on dealing with katara. [33] azula and ty lee - known as \"tyzula\" , this is a fairly popular ship. ty lee frequently compliments azula, and many fans feel that azula has a soft spot for ty lee, as demonstrated in \"the beach\". they state that ty lee's betrayal was what sent azula over the edge, and despite ty lee's betrayal at the boiling rock, this remains a popular ship, arguably more popular than any other ship involving either girl in avatar: the last airbender. song and zuko - known as \"zong\" - this short-lived ship came up after an jin and zuko - known as \"jinko ba sing se, displayed an open attraction to zuko and eventually earned a date with him at iroh's insistence. zuko denied that jin was his girlfriend, but he enjoyed his date more than he wanted anyone to know. zuko and jin even shared a kiss before zuko realized that their relationship would never work out, leaving her somewhat saddened. zuko later admitted to iroh that his date was\" nice \". [45] jin and zuko met again, but by this point, zuko was back with his childhood sweetheart, mai. [46] suki and zuko - known as\" makorra \", fans known as\" makorrians \"- this wildly popular the legend of korra ship was inspired well before the series debuted. when korra and mako first encountered, [47] makorra hints were present, causing the shipping to peak. the ship went viral once a promotional trailer showed a shot of korra kissing mako. although their relationship is still fairly undeveloped, the ship supporters continue to grow in numbers based on the various teasings of the couple. ikki and jinora explicitly state the fact that korra has a crush on mako, the two involuntarily fall asleep on each other at republic city park, and when the two pose as a couple to infiltrate amon's rally to save [48] in fact, mako's scarf has been a center argument for many fans, claiming it is similar to the\" red string of fate \", an idea in eastern mythology that the god's might tie two lover's fates together with a red string so that they will meet and never separate. furthermore, korra is revealed to be jealous of asami and mako's budding relationship. [49] when korra admitted her feelings to mako, he initially shot her down, but after witnessing her going on a date with bolin, mako expressed feelings of jealousy. when korra then kissed him by surprise, he willingly kissed her back, complicating his relationship with asami and his brother. [50] mako continues having an interest in korra's welfare, as he was the first to hug her after she faced off against some equalist factory when he could have carried lin or tenzin as well, but left them for his brother. borra\" or \"kolin\" - this ship has a lot of fans that would like to see korra and bolin have a non-platonic relationship. bolin convinced toza to let korra pass by after she snuck into the pro-bending arena, and invited her back to the pro-bending teams' locker room to watch the match. the two soon became friends, he willingly showed her some pro-bending tricks and was quick to accept her on the [48] bolin thanked her by giving her a cupcake and a rose. his little gesture of kindness was overshadowed by the large gift basket the. bolin immediately inquired whether or not that \"tarrlok guy\" was bothering korra, as he was willing to have a word with him. when korra laughed it off, saying that tarrlok was just \"some old guy\" , bolin expressed joy upon hearing this, stating \"that sounds better, i like that better\". [49] soon after, bolin talked to mako about korra being his future girlfriend, saying that he and korra would be perfect for each other. although mako was against it, bolin asked korra out, and took her to narook's seaweed noodlery for their \"date\". they ate dinner, had fun, and took a trip to republic city's tower to gaze out over the city's skyline. bolin bought korra a bouquet of flowers the next day, but witnessed her kissing mako, which reduced him to tears. masami \"or\" mami \"- this ship began when asami accidentally hit mako with her moped, introducing the two. upon laying eyes on her, mako was smitten by asami's beauty. to make up for the accident, asami asked him on a date to kuang's cuisine, at which asami holds mako's hand. at tarrlok's gala, the two go as a couple and asami is seen consistently holding mako's arm. later on, the two ride in a taxi cab through republic city park where they express their emotions, eventually leading to the two cuddling. [49] mako and asami are currently going steady, leaving korra to be\" the other woman \". [50] given that this ship is a strong threat due to the two officially dating, there is always the chance for a shipping war similar to kataang/zutara of the series prior. mako was willing to threaten his friendship with korra when she insisted on going after asami's father, immediately choosing asami over korra. he also cares deeply for asami's safety and is very protective over her, venturing down a possibly dangerous road in her place to find out information for her. tahorra\" or \"tahnorra\" - this ship began when a promo was released revealing tahno and korra standing in close quarters. during this interaction, korra challenged him to a fight, calling him \"pretty boy\" , and then the wolfbats' waterbender uttered: \"go for it\". this first interaction occurred while the avatar was on a date with bolin, when korra saw that tahno was staring at them. tahno walked over to her and offered her pro-bending \"private lessons\". this single scene resulted in a constantly expanding fandom. [50] korra and tahno also interacted when tahno was at the \"bosami\" - this undeveloped ship is occasionally promoted by makorra advocates, conveniently pairing asami with bolin to solve asami's love interest in mako and bolin's love interest in korra. makorra advocates also use it to ship the new team avatar as makorra and bosami. the two have interacted infrequently, but bolin enjoyed living in asami's mansion after the closing of the [51] he also seems to trust asami with pabu, as she was seen holding pabu when mako and bolin are preparing to move out of the arena. in search of korra, bolin told asami about mako's true love, revealing korra and mako's first kiss. days later, bolin aided asami to defeat <mark>hiroshi sato</mark> by sending earth boulders to <mark>hiroshi sato</mark>'s mecha tank. [52] iroh and korra - known as \"iroh debuted, but before he and korra even met, masami fans and fans strongly against makorra started shipping korra with iroh. after iroh receives word that republic city is under attack, iroh states that he\" look [s] forward to winning back republic city, together. \"[53] later, when iroh's fleets were approaching the city, he was attacked, and fell in the water. korra saved him and brought him to team avatar's hideout, and used waterbending to heal his wounds. iroh was at first against the idea of korra leaving to fight amon, but decided that his grandfather, zuko, would value the avatar's opinion, so he should too. [54] iroh and asami - known as\" irosami \"or\" asaroh \"- as with korroh, this ship began before iroh and asami met by makorra shippers who did not like bosami. the pair barely interacted during their time together in the series. they first met after korra brought iroh to team avatar's hideout. after korra and mako left to fight amon, iroh and asami, along with bolin, naga, and pabu, went to attack the equalist's airfield, but were captured by <mark>hiroshi</mark>. after naga freed them, iroh split up with the group in an equalist airplane to destroy other airplanes. [54] korra and asami - known as\" \"pemzin\" - pema and tenzin are happily married with three kids, with their fourth child being born during the series. fans have expressed shock over the sixteen year age difference between them, but that has not stopped people from enjoying and celebrating their relationship. tenzin and lin beifong - known as \"linzin\" or \"tenlin\" - as the son of the avatar and the daughter of one of his good friends, they have known each other since childhood. they were once romantically involved, but began to drift apart due to \"different goals in life\". pema told korra that she could not watch tenzin spend his life with \"the wrong woman\". [50] tenzin broke up with lin after pema confessed her love for him. however, there is still lots of friction between the chief and the airbender. korra even suggested that lin has still not gotten over what happened. lin agreed to tenzin's request to be lenient with korra when she destroyed some shops in republic city, and promised to act with more decorum during the pro-bending tournament championship when he asked her. [32] furthermore, lin was very willing to help out her old boyfriend out by protecting his family whilst he went to an urgent council meeting, and even put her life and bending on the line in order to buy tenzin and his family time from the pursuing equalists. edit fans often had a \"fan preferred couple\" which they attempted to find reasons to substantiate as well as reasons to disregard other possible matches with these characters. some fans even designated a pairing which they defended fervently. fanon was written extensively; forums were filled with \"shipping\" theories and rumors. this often resulted in conflicts between conflicting \"shippings\" , the most well-known example being between \"kataang\" and \"zutara\". supporters on both sides became increasingly antagonistic to the other \"ship\" and theories extended beyond how their \"ship\" was correct to how the other \"ship\" was incorrect. often, shippers would cite how one member of the opposing ship was or should be romantically attracted to a different person. typically kataangers would cite zuko and mai's relationship, while zutarians began shipping toph with aang to deal with the problem of the hero being unattached. because the correct \"ships\" remained unrevealed throughout most of the show, fans constantly debated their preferred \"ships\". at one point, the creators, bryan konietzko, said they were inclined to \"kataang\" , but did not say outright that it was correct, noting \"zutara\" as an interesting concept. they also expressed surprise about the concept of \"shipping\". the \"shipping wars\" had a generally negative impact on the avatar fan community. although the correct \"ships\" have now been revealed, there is still an antagonistic feeling among a small number of avatar fans. with the release of legend of korra, the \"shipping wars\" now concern the conflicting ships of this series, particularly \"masami\" and \"makorra\". shipping war i - this shipping war took place during avatar: the last airbender and continued for a few months after the last episode in book 3: fire and mainly revolved around the zutara, maiko, and kataang ships. shipping war ii - this shipping war is ongoing in the legend of korra and mainly revolves around the makorra, masami, and borra ships. shipping conflict - this shipping conflict is ongoing, and has the potential of becoming a full fledged shipping war. it revolves around the tokka/the doph and linzin/pemzin shippings, as well as revival of old zutara, maiko, and kataang hatred. it primarily started when lin lost her bending in this is for those who ship makorra or masami and those who have been hating on mako, korra, or asami, i do not mean to offend anyone this is just my opinion ^ not that i'm homophobic, but your reasoning is a bit of a logical reach there. ^ how is it hateful and homophobic if they simply don't show a homosexual couple. and to clear the air, i'm not homophobic, but if your gonna swing for the other team and flaunt it around, don't do it around me. yes well, some parents don't like their kids watching shows with murder-suicides in them. too bad for those parents. this is a fan webpage, we do not have to censor ourselves for everyone. for those of you who think korrasami should be taken down simply because you believe it to be \"inappropriate,' please stop being so ignorant. yes, we are well aware that nickelodeon would never allow a gay couple to be depicted in their programming, but this list has nothing to do with accuracy and what would most likely happen. there are a fair amount of fans of this ship who believe they have some sort of chemistry, or merely want them together in the romantic sense. while i don't really think it's an appropiate ship (except in terms of\" romantic friendship' rather than lesbianism) i'm inclined to agree that it should stay as the purpose of this page is not to show the ships that will or can happen so much as the pairing that fans ship in general. frankly i find toph and zuko pretty sick (age difference, anyone?). but it's still on here because it is a popular ship with some canon evidence. korrasami should really be a \"make believe ship\" that shouldn't be on the official shipping page, and should just stay in the minds of people who think they should be together...even though they never will be. and ^ age doesn't matter, but they really shouldn't be together anyway, i just don't see it...honestly, i know two kids that where raised by gay couples and they came out completely fine and unscarred. they love their parents, gender doesn't matter to them. it's not going to screw up the kids mind, if anything never showing a gay couple will because they hear about gay couples and don't understand and then wonder why it's not in anything they watch if they hear about it. my sister's step daughter turned to me in the middle of watching arthur and said: \"why aren't there any love between buster and arthur like uncle tommy and uncle richy?\" she's completely and utterly confused as to why none of her favorite shows show a relationship like my brother's and his husband."}, {"articleID": "2010012020_00011459_W", "names": {"David Miller": ["Q1175688", "Q12899557", "Q15455696", "Q16185473", "Q19875639", "Q20656547", "Q28870727", "Q3018511", "Q30607124", "Q404333", "Q404779", "Q5237563", "Q5237568", "Q5237569", "Q5237573", "Q5237574", "Q5237576", "Q55196713", "Q56458216", "Q57729525", "Q57832355", "Q6828449", "Q92986"], "Leslie Thomas": ["Q23409670", "Q3403159"]}, "date": "2010-01-20", "url": "http://northjersey.com/r?19=961&43=518787&44=82175092&32=4497&7=309037&40=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.northjersey.com%2Fcommunity%2F82175092_Cousin_s_death_sparks_Wyckoff_worker_s_Haitian_relief_effort.html", "content": "community cousin's death sparks wyckoff worker's haitian relief effort last updated: wednesday january 20, 2010, 2:48 pm wyckoff -

She prays that they will \"be saved and be able to support and take care of themselves, and if they get a family, to be able to support the family and not to get on drugs .\" Quote Every day, McDowell County's Virginia Dickerson prays that her great-grandchildren will \"be saved and be able to support and take care of themselves, and if they get a family, to be able to support the family and not to get on drugs .\" Graffiti doesn't mar school property, and schools don't have metal detectors in McDowell, a county at the southernmost tip of West Virginia. There are no gangs here. Students wave and greet visitors in school hallways. A Bible verse, I <mark>Timothy</mark> 4:12, hand-scrawled on a sign posted by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, welcomes all who enter River View High School: \"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity .\" With its popular Hatfield-McCoy Trail snaking through densely treed mountains, trout fishing and have-a-seat-on-my-porch culture, McDowell County could be some sort of utopia if not for the abandoned businesses that outnumber the open ones along its namesake avenue in Welch, the county seat, and its spiraling, two-lane highways so dangerous that churchgoers thank God on Sunday mornings that they made it through the week safely. The county competes with its coalfield neighbors for having the highest unemployment rate in the state. In 2016, it was the county with the highest opioid mortality rate in the nation. But lately, in the place that for more than 50 years has been the poster child for rural poverty in America, change has been taking hold. Schools have been returned to community control. The four-year graduation rate is up 14 percentage points, from 74 in the 2010-11 school year to 88.3 in 2016, which is above the national average. According to school administrators, teen pregnancies have gone from 64.3 per 1,000 births to 52.5--a nearly 20 percent drop. The county established a juvenile drug court. The county's dial-up internet service was replaced with high-speed internet in 2014. Students have laptops and access to computers and new books. The improvements can nearly all be attributed to Reconnecting McDowell, a collaboration among the schools; local, state and federal government agencies; and private entities, including telecommunications, construction and coal-producing businesses, health care providers, teachers unions, and nonprofits. Its partners have put their many political and policy differences aside, pledging to stay as long as needed to help the county \"create a new reality,\" starting with the lives of its children. Yet, despite its successes, six years after more than 100 individuals and organizations signed that pledge, McDowell is at a crossroads. Its schools still struggle, many of its gains are hard to quantify and the partnership is grappling with how to keep positive momentum going in the face of budget cuts and uncertainties under the <mark>Trump</mark> administration. One proposed cut would eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission, a significant funder of an $8 million teacher housing project in Welch the partnership hoped would provide a concrete symbol of its commitment and the community's progress. Development on the project has stalled, and people are slowly losing sight of the purpose of that vacant lot downtown. Versions of Dickerson's prayer for the safety of the children are repeated throughout McDowell each morning. The opioid crisis in this county of some 19,000-and-dropping residents, located at the intersection of the Bible and the Rust belts, has tested the everyone-looks-out-for-one-another tradition here, compelling grandparents and great-grandparents like Dickerson, who have family members struggling with finances or substance and domestic abuse, to raise school-age children decades after they and their own children finished school or dropped out. (Nearly 47 percent of residents over 25 in McDowell don't have a high school diploma, the highest percent of dropouts in the state .) Already under state control for nearly a decade, the McDowell school system hit bottom in 2009-10. Student performance on state tests ranked it as the lowest-performing school district in West Virginia--which ranked in the bottom quarter of states nationally on math and reading performance assessments. Some county educators and mental health professionals pointed to a \"culture of poverty\" or a \"poverty mindset\" dating back generations as the root of the problems, one that would be hard--maybe impossible--to dig out. Dickerson's family hasn't escaped the effects of the county's hard times: Two of her daughters battled drug addiction, a granddaughter brought her children to Dickerson when she could no longer support them after her marriage ended, one grandson served a year in federal prison for selling drugs and another is incarcerated. Now, while the side effects of generations of poverty remain omnipresent in McDowell, its schools have been emerging as bellwethers of change. Still, although national news outlets have covered McDowell's turnaround efforts, residents haven't necessarily connected the positive steps that have been made so far with the work of the public-private collective, local leaders say. The lack of a visible symbol might be partly to blame. \"[People] can't see anything,\" said Welch Mayor Reba Honaker. \"People need to see what's going on .\" McDowell County Schools Superintendent Nelson Spencer isn't bothered by the initiative's low profile because the community and its stakeholders are Reconnecting McDowell. \"It's an umbrella,\" he said. \"It should be the entire community did it and gets the credit for it ....If it was just an outside entity that came in, they would have been rejected immediately .\" But the lack of local visibility and understanding might be undermining the project's future. More than three-quarters of voters in this historically blue county supported <mark>Donald Trump</mark> last year based on his promise of returning coal jobs and building roads. West Virginia state Sen. Chandler Swope, a Republican who represents the area, said people didn't see the vote as a choice between improving education or improving the economy; they saw voting for the candidate who supported coal as a matter of survival. \"West Virginia would have been doomed if <mark>Trump</mark> had not gotten elected,\" Swope said. In fact, since the election, two coal mines and a processing plant have opened in McDowell. But the new additions have brought only 265 jobs to a place where 69 percent of people are unemployed or not in the labor market. The promised infrastructure improvements haven't materialized yet. Meanwhile, <mark>Trump</mark>'s policy prescriptions spell trouble for Reconnecting McDowell and the progress local schools have made. His budget would do away with funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants and an additional $575,000 in Title II funds, according to the American Federation of Teachers, a lead partner in Reconnecting McDowell. The cuts would effectively eliminate after-school programs at seven of McDowell's 10 public schools and threaten money that could support 13 full-time teaching jobs or professional development for 95 teachers. Seeing beams going up on the teacher housing project, now called Renaissance Village, would give Reconnecting McDowell the visibility it needs, as test scores also haven't risen as fast as many hoped, leaving it without stand-out numbers to trumpet the initiative's value. The county still ranks last in the state on reading and math exams, despite incremental improvements. Even if test scores haven't budged much, McDowell schools have changed dramatically in the decades since Dickerson had to leave in 1961 after becoming pregnant, and the changes are accelerating. Girls are no longer required to leave school and sit out a year after having a baby. The U.S. Supreme Court banned school prayer in 1962. Now breakfast, lunch and, in some cases, dinner are free thanks to expanded federal support. In the last few years, schools have overhauled their curricula and gone beyond teaching to provide services like dental care and mental health counseling. Entire school communities are benefiting from the introduction of mental health services and supports into the schools. \"It's been amazing,\" said Kristy East, principal of Welch Elementary School. \"We have a lot of students with anger issues,\" she said, noting that many students have incarcerated or deceased parents. \"They just don't have those coping skills,\" she said. \"[Teachers] aren't trained to deal with that .\" When Dickerson's 13-year-old great-grandson was \"disrespectful in school,\" Dickerson turned to the district's in-school mental health counseling services for help. In 2015, McDowell was one of three counties in West Virginia to receive federal Project AWARE grants (totaling $9.7 million) to \"bring mental health practices into the school and ensure teachers are equipped to manage the mental health problems of students and their families,\" said McDowell County Schools Project AWARE coordinator Kenneth Birchfield. Now, more than 3 percent of students receive in-school individual mental health therapy or group counseling, according to school officials. Hanging over the initiative, which is targeted at kids who have experienced trauma at home, is the fear that the administration could \"zero out funding at any time .\" Quote More than 3 percent of McDowell County students receive in-school individual mental health therapy or group counseling. Birchfield said that while mental health services previously existed in the region, they weren't offered in schools, and none were located in McDowell County. The agencies also weren't communicating and were replicating one another's efforts. Reconnecting McDowell provides \"an extra layer of communications and collaboration,\" bringing them all together to share information and marshal resources. Birchfield hosted the first joint meeting of the newly constituted Project AWARE leadership team in September. To support grandparents like Dickerson, the district also launched a Second Time Around Club for \"grandfamilies raising grandkids,\" which is supported with federal Title I funding for low-income schools. Nearly half of district children live in a home without a biological parent, according to Reconnecting McDowell. The club, along with the district's family advisory council, brings grandparents and guardians into the schools, giving them an opportunity to de-stress while learning parenting and coping strategies. Birchfield was a featured speaker at the Grandparents Day celebration for the Second Time Around Club in September, when some two dozen attendees learned how to build their young charges' self-esteem by not \"over complimenting them,\" while also taking a painting lesson, being served a hot ham lunch and getting a primer on the meaning of social media acronyms like BTW, L8R and POS. The last one stumped most of them. It stands for \"parent over shoulder,\" Birchfield explained. Children's more mundane-seeming needs are now also being taken care of in the schools. More than half the county's 3,056 schoolchildren received in-school dental checkups and treatment in 2016, school officials said. The district was connected to a mobile dental service through the Reconnecting McDowell partnership. Quote Teen pregnancies in McDowell County have dropped nearly 20 percent, from 64 births per 1000 to 53, and the graduation rate rose 8 percent, but only 21 percent of students are proficient in math. Still, though educators are pleased with the progress they're making to ensure students are physically and emotionally ready to learn, they are frustrated by their inability, so far, to make more academic gains. A switch to the federally supported Common Core State Standards in math and English set the county back. The county's math proficiency rate dropped to 14 percent when new Common Core tests were introduced in 2015. That rate has since increased to 21 percent, but is still below the state average of 34 percent. Quote \"Nowadays we have this math called hard core? Common Core? You have to go around <mark>John Henry</mark>'s barn to say two plus two is four .\" Virginia Dickerson, a great-grandmother in McDowell County Dickerson's 15-year-old great-granddaughter, Vitonni, is in a \"high math class\" at Mount View High School. Dickerson, who still works full time as a deputy clerk in the Magistrate Court building, shakes her head as she talks about how math has changed. \"We had algebra,\" she said. \"Nowadays we have this math called hard core? Common Core? You have to go around <mark>John Henry</mark>'s barn to say two plus two is four,\" she laughed, adding that when her great-granddaughter kiddingly asks her for help, she fires back, \"I can't, because I don't know nothing about no Common Core math .\" Attendance is another persistent problem, said <mark>Timothy Hughes</mark>, the county's school psychologist. Given the problems associated with poverty and substance abuse in the home, \"education isn't a priority as it is in the more affluent areas,\" <mark>Hughes</mark> said. \"Some parents aren't educated beyond high school and don't understand the importance of an education .\" Students are often left to fend for themselves or to care for younger siblings, missing the bus and school. Attendance dropped from 93 percent in 2011-12 to 90 percent in 2016-17. \"If you put an intervention in place and a student isn't there, you can't help them,\" <mark>Hughes</mark> said. He added that he's also had students tell him that they \"just want to grow up and draw a check .\" Quote \"If we help one child, that's well worth it. That is a success and that is a win .\" McDowell County Schools Superintendent Nelson Spencer Asked if he will see a change in this cultural mindset in his career, Spencer said, \"I don't know .\" \"If we help one child, that's well worth it,\" Spencer said. \"That is a success, and that is a win .\" Meanwhile, parents and grandparents like Dickerson continue to encourage their children to get an education and a skill and leave McDowell. Dickerson earned her diploma in 1985, the same year as her daughter, Renetta, and 24 years after she left school to have the first of her seven children. She keeps her diploma handy. \"I carry it everywhere I go \u2019cause I was proud of it,\" she said. Dickerson doesn't know what the future holds, for herself or her hometown. Of her two great-grandchildren still living with her, Dickerson says that her great-granddaughter \"hasn't said anything about what she wants to do,\" and she thinks her great-grandson wants to design homes. She said she prays for her husband's health and her own, because \"nobody's going to have to look after me .\" This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

(AP) - Wildlife rehabilitation experts are working to keep two baby opossums alive after the mother was apparently beaten to death with a sharp rock. The 2-year-old mother with two babies in her pouch was found in critical condition by a security guard outside an industrial building in Fontana last week, the Press-Enterprise reported (http: //bit.ly/1sEUKAP). The mother opossum died three days later, said Karolyn Verville, who heads Sunshine Haven Animal Rescue & Wildlife Rehabilitation in Riverside. Verville has been feeding cat milk replacement to the hungry babies, which she says tends to suit most wildlife. \"We're the next best thing to mom,\" she told The Associated Press on Sunday. Police in Fontana are searching for the attacker, after a sharp rock with blood and fur on it was found near the opossum. Animal shelter staff had hoped to save the mother opossum, which had possible skull and jaw fractures, so she could continue to nurse the babies until they were old enough to release into the wild. Verville said the babies need care for three months before they can be returned to their environment. State law requires animals to be released no more than three miles from the place where they were found, she said. \"The idea is not to protect them from death - nobody can do that,\" she said. \"It is just to give them a chance at life .\" meta content = \"2014-09-14 08:49:46\" > Hillary Clinton in Iowa stirs 2016 speculation Hillary Rodham Clinton is returning to Iowa to pay tribute to the state's retiring Democratic senator as anticipation builds over the possibility of another presidential campaign.

Flemming and Fowler, both 29, along with their friend and business partner, Will <mark>Hamilton</mark>, 37, were pouring their creative energies into a high-tech training device the likes of which the sporting world had never seen. They were building a better broom. Not just any broom, but one that they thought could be essential to the sport of curling, which relies on the best broom handling out there as teams strategically cajole a polished granite rock across a sheet of ice. They wound up calling it the SmartBroom, and in a sport that can come across as vaguely primordial, their piece of 21st-century gadgetry could play a role in determining who wins gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. <mark>Matt Hamilton</mark>, a member of the U.S. men's team, overhauled his sweeping technique after training with a SmartBroom. Curlers from countries as far afield as China, Denmark and Switzerland have leaned on it in their preparation for the Olympics. In all, Will <mark>Hamilton</mark>, who is not related to <mark>Matt Hamilton</mark>, said he had sold SmartBrooms to eight of the 13 national curling federations sending teams to Pyeongchang. \"We definitely learned a few tricks,\" said Marc Kennedy, a member of the Canadian men's team. A quick primer on sweeping: It is important. The science behind it is much more complicated than people think. The simplified version is that sweeping slightly increases the temperature of the ice while creating micro-scratches on the surface. The result is that players are better able to control for distance and trajectory as the rock travels down the sheet. The sport hinges on precision, so every brush stroke counts. But for decades, there have been competing theories about sweeping. One such debate: Is it more important to sweep faster, with a higher stroke rate, or harder, with greater force applied to the ice? And what about body positioning? Do sweepers generate more power by holding the broom upright or at an angle? These were the types of questions eating at Will <mark>Hamilton</mark>. <mark>Hamilton</mark> was coaching a junior women's team six years ago and wanted to help his sweepers improve their technique. But he knew there was no clear way to assess how well they were actually doing. It was all guesswork. <mark>Hamilton</mark> dreamed of producing data that could be used to solve some of those age-old curling debates. So he zeroed in on Flemming and Fowler, two friends with engineering degrees. <mark>Hamilton</mark> knew they liked to build stuff for fun. At the time, they were trying to invent a climate-controlled, water-cooled suit jacket. When <mark>Hamilton</mark> met with Flemming over beers one night, he pitched a new project: Was there a way to take a pedometer (to measure stroke rate) and a miniature bathroom scale (to measure force) and fuse them to a curling broom? \"So Andrew looks at me like I'm an idiot and says,\" No, you'd use, like, four sensors and an accelerometer,' \"<mark>Hamilton</mark> recalled .\" But I could tell that he thought it was interesting. \"Flemming and Fowler were coming to realize that their climate-controlled suit jacket was not about to set the world on fire. (Fowler still has a couple of half-finished prototypes in his closet .) Perhaps they would be better served by focusing on the high-tech broom .\" This has been slightly more successful, \"Flemming said. On a recent afternoon, Flemming joined Fowler and <mark>Hamilton</mark> on the curling ice here at Westmount Golf and Country Club for a demonstration. They wore matching windbreakers with\" SmartBroom: Sweep Better \"on the backs. Each SmartBroom has four sensors in the broom head that relay data to a small display unit. <mark>Hamilton</mark> took one for a spin down the ice, and the data was instantaneous--line graphs along with a slew of numbers that showed his force in pounds and his stroke rate in hertz. <mark>Hamilton</mark> also pointed to a figure that he described as his\" sweeping performance index, \"or SPI, a metric that combines power and speed in one easy-to-digest figure. <mark>Patrick Janssen</mark>, a world-class curler from Canada, has consistently registered an SPI in the 2,800 range. Fowler provided context .\" As a Thursday night club curler, I'd be happy to get 2,000, \"he said. The numbers by themselves might not mean much, Flemming said, but subtle changes in technique can lead to big differences in the quality of each stroke. And now curlers have that information at their disposal. They can experiment to see which stroke works best for them .\" It's sometimes tough to convince an athlete that what they're doing is maybe not the best, because they feel like they're working really, really hard, \"Flemming said .\" And it's probably true that they're working really, really hard. But they might also be wasting a lot of energy. \"The first SmartBroom was used by Canada before the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. But at the request of Curling Canada, the country's national curling federation, <mark>Hamilton</mark> and his partners agreed not to sell SmartBrooms to other consumers until after the Olympics. Fowler called it a\" polite agreement \"rooted in relationships with Curling Canada officials. In Sochi, the Canadian men and women swept gold. Ahead of the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the gospel of the SmartBroom spread across the globe, and many of the teams competing in South Korea this month are acolytes. <mark>Matt Hamilton</mark>, the American curler, said he discovered that he was able to generate greater force by holding the broom more upright. Kennedy, the Canadian curler, said he learned that pressure was more important than stroke rate. So now he sacrifices speed for the sake of power .\" For years, \"he said,\" we thought it was the other way around. \"Curlers have also used the SmartBroom to assess their physical conditioning. They can compare their statistics from the beginning of a workout to those at the end, or even after several weeks of training. Will <mark>Hamilton</mark> declined to say how many SmartBrooms he and his partners have sold, but they are not retiring anytime soon--or even quitting their day jobs. Flemming and Fowler are engineers, and <mark>Hamilton</mark> works in information technology for a hardware company. The SmartBroom, <mark>Hamilton</mark> said, is a\" side hustle, \"albeit a useful one. The broom retails for $3,000. (Canadians get a discount .) They all hope that more innovations are forthcoming. For example: hardware light enough to embed in brooms used in competition so that real-time statistics can be broadcast on television .\" This, \"Flemming said,\" is not the end of what we plan to do. \""}, {"articleID": "2009061822_00001150_W", "names": {"Tony Scott": ["Q18353288", "Q193648", "Q2550621", "Q27831098", "Q32937", "Q57306593", "Q7823372", "Q7823373"], "Mark Everett": ["Q6767558", "Q958642"]}, "date": "2009-06-18", "url": "http://gazette.com/entertainment/genre-56769-rated-games.html", "content": "video games \"ghostbusters the video game\" (xbox 360, ps3, wii, pc, ps2, ds and psp;

One of the exuberant dance numbers in\" Fela! \"The bedrock of the show is the infectious music by Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. The Afrobeat star Fela Kuti might have seemed an unlikely candidate for a Broadway musical. But theatrical producer Stephen Hendel, a passionate fan, was determined to create a biographical show about the man, a musical with both artistic and mass-audience appeal. He brought the idea to the right person: Bill T. Jones, the leader of the innovative Bill T. Jones/Arne Zane Dance Company and a Tony Award winner as choreographer for the musical\" Spring Awakening. \"The resultant vibrant 2009 theater piece,\" Fela! \"- coming to the Paramount Theatre this week - shook Broadway out of its commercial family-musical torpor .\" Steve didn't want a conventional Broadway director, but someone who could give Fela (as he was widely known) the treatment he deserved, \"Jones recalled by phone recently .\" He felt Fela was the greatest musician nobody heard of. I'd been listening to him since the 1970s, and he's a staple among great jazz and pop musicians, but he had no presence in the world of musical theater. \"Fela did, however, have quite a backstory. The flamboyant composer and multi-instrumentalist pioneered the blending of jazz, funk, psychedelic rock and African rhythms into an exciting, intoxicating Afrobeat brew. He was an outspoken political dissident against the military regime in his native Nigeria. He was also a macho polygamist who had 27 wives; he was a marijuana lover whose pot habit rivaled Jamaican pop idol Bob Marley's; and he had an enormous ego. He was arrested and jailed repeatedly by the Nigerian authorities - often on charges (including conspiracy to murder one of his own band members) that Fela claimed were politically motivated. In 1977, his Lagos compound was burned down, and his activist mother killed, in a Nigerian army raid. How to convey Fela's saga (he died in 1997 of AIDS) to a Broadway crowd? How to evoke his musical genius and political courage, but not sidestep the less savory, more contradictory aspects of his hedonistic life?\" We felt people needed to know in the first half of the show what a brilliant person this is, who he was, why he's important, and make that emotional connection with him, \"said Jones. And his character?\" I was not in a position to judge Fela. Let's assume you went to a concert of his, and he revealed himself to you. You can take what you need and leave the rest. First and foremost, he was an artist. \"The framework for the musical Jones and co-writer <mark>Jim Lewis</mark> devised is a late-1970s concert that Fela gave at The Afrika Shrine, his Lagos nightclub. Riffing off and through the feverish Afrobeat numbers are nonlinear biographical incidents and musings, inspired by Carlos Moore's authorized biography,\" Fela: This Bitch of a Life! \"But the bedrock of the piece is Fela's infectious music - complemented by Jones' fevered choreography and executed by hip-swinging dancers who sometimes encourage the audience to get up and groove along .\" It took over four years to clear all the music rights with Fela's family, \"said Jones. Members of Antibalas, a Brooklyn-based Afrobeat tribute band that performs many of Fela's compositions note for note, were brought in to perform, as well as oversee the musical direction and arrangements .\" The band wanted to play the shows exactly as Fela would, \"said Jones .\" But I wanted to deconstruct the music, change some of the instruments, because Afrobeat is really music for dancing. There's no relief from the groove, and that groove can become deadly in a theater if it's not relieved by storytelling. \"After a years-long gestation and many changes,\" Fela! \"was unveiled in a short pre-Broadway 2008 run at New York's 37 Arts. Though some critics felt the script was weak, Variety reviewer <mark>David Rooney</mark> pointed out that the show\" aims to be less traditional musical theater than cathartic experience, lacing its communicative passion with infectious euphoria, rebellious anger and heartfelt despair. \"After more revisions,\" Fela! \"moved to Broadway in 2009, aided by an infusion of cash and cachet from celebrity co-producers Jay-Z, <mark>Will Smith</mark> and Jada Pinkett-Smith. In the Disneyfied precincts of Broadway, the show's white-hot music, carnality and revolutionary politics were (to my mind) a glorious anomaly.

Adesola Osakalumi and Duain Richmond alternate in the demanding title role.
