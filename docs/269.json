I've always wanted to play there .\" \"I'm sure going for the first time for a World Series game, it should be fun,\" he said. Well, wait until he trips over a bullpen mound chasing a foul ball. Or a teammate loses a fly in the mist that wafts above shallow center. Or those swirling winds turn a routine popup into an all-out scramble. Who knows? Might even get a crazy carom off that odd-shaped brick facade on the right-field wall, resulting in the first Series inside-the-park home run since 1929. Yep, loads of fun. Hosmer, <mark>Alex Gordon</mark>, Mike Moustakas and most of the Royals will get their first look at quirky AT & T Park during a workout Thursday. Then it's on to Game 3 on Friday with Kansas City and the Giants tied at 1-all. Tim Hudson starts for San Francisco against Jeremy Guthrie. The Royals' only trip to San Francisco came in 2005 and they took two of three. Buddy Bell was the manager, Tony Graffanino batted third and Jeremy Affeldt was in the bullpen. The 35-year-old Affeldt now pitches for the Giants and came on in relief Wednesday night in a 7-2 loss. He said he figured the Royals could handle the new park. \"That's an athletic team over there. So I think they can make adjustments. I don't think we'll go in thinking that they're at a disadvantage because of not being at our ballpark,\" he said. About one-third of the Royals have played at AT & T Park with other teams. Of the most frequent visitors, Josh Willingham has hit .352 with five homers in 16 games and Omar Infante has batted .307 in 19 games, STATS said. Among the pitchers, Guthrie did fine in two starts and Jason Frasor made two relief appearances. Outfielder Lorenzo Cain played one game at the stadium in 2010 when he was with Milwaukee. The AL Championship Series MVP plans to practice with coach Rusty Kuntz to \"work on my angles and see how the park plays .\" \"It's kind of a work in progress and a wait-and-see type thing,\" Cain said. Good luck, Giants designated hitter <mark>Michael Morse</mark> said. \"It's a big park; right field is tricky. The wind does a lot of different things in the outfield, so our guys are used to it,\" he said. \"It's tough. It's tough out there. But everybody's a professional. I don't think it will be a factor,\" he said. One thing will change, for sure. With no DH in the NL park, <mark>Morse</mark> and Kansas City's <mark>Billy Butler</mark> will lose their spots - <mark>Morse</mark> drove in a run during a 7-1 win in the opener, while <mark>Butler</mark> already has three hits and a pair of RBIs. With tight foul ground, gusts that whip off McCovey Cove, twilight starts and pesky seagulls that hover around in the late innings, a lot of balls become adventures in San Francisco. In 2007, <mark>Ichiro Suzuki</mark> hit the first inside-the-park home run in an All-Star game when his shot off the right-field wall took a weird ricochet. There have been nine inside-the-parkers in World Series play. Lou Gehrig and Casey Stengel are on the list, and Mule Haas of the Philadelphia Athletics hit the last one in 1929. Plus, postseason is frequently a weather adventure in the Bay Area. Players need to pack for all sorts of conditions - short sleeves, hoodies, hats and gloves. During the NLCS, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said the teams played in the toughest winds of the season. Right fielder Hunter Pence had no chance trying to track a fly ball by St. Louis' Kolten Wong that landed for a triple. \"You play this game, you play in a lot of different ballparks and you find a way to adjust,\" Pence said this week. \"I think everyone's going to enjoy it .\" Moustakas was looking forward to the trip. Raised in Southern California, the Royals third baseman has seen AT & T Park only on television. \"I don't know anything about it,\" he said. \"It looks like a beautiful park. I've always wanted to see it, and this is a great opportunity to go there .\" ___ AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley contributed to this report.

Scene from \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power .\" Courtesy of American Film Foundation. Like many political events of the past few decades, Anita Hill's 1991 testimony before the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary can be recognized from a few token soundbites. Hill, then an attorney-advisor to Clarence Thomas, accused Thomas of sexual harassment preceding confirmation hearings for his nomination as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Hill passed a polygraph test; Thomas declined, calling it a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks .\" According to the film \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power,\" this phrase is a grossly misleading caricature of a difficult case. The original hearing was televised on October 12. As a nod, it seems, both to the anniversary of Hill's hearing and the recent controversy surrounding Title IX rights on campus, Stanford University sponsored a two-day conference from October 16 to 17 with Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University. The conference featured a new documentary and workshops on Hill's hearing and sexual harassment in the workplace. \"Anita: Speaking Truth to Power\" was screened on October 16 at Paul Brest Hall, with a Q & A with Professor Hill afterwards. Director Freida Mock's documentary is a compilation of interviews with Hill and her colleagues and footage from the original hearing. Throughout the film, the audience is granted glimpses of a woman who remained remarkably poised while under attack from members of Congress. In the course of the film's commentary, Hill's friends point out the imbalance of demographics at the trial's outset. The Senate Judiciary Committee was homogeneously white and male (a much younger Joe Biden presided over the proceedings). Gender and race were hot-button topics that received only a cursory evaluation - the film commits a number of blundering inquiries to memory. In an interview, <mark>John Carr</mark>, a friend of Hill's, underscored the invisible consequences of the trial. \"She paid the price,\" said <mark>Carr</mark>. \"She could've been a judicial nominee .\" The film highlighted the committee's bouts of targeted questioning, most of which required that Hill reiterate embarrassing details of her encounters with Thomas, seemed designed to make her sound absurd. Hill's quiet resilience provided a foil for Thomas's fiery rebuttals. \"I think that this today is a travesty,\" said Thomas during his testimony, in reference to the hearing in whole. He proceeded to categorically reject every accusation against him - the phrase \"high-tech lynching\" was used during this opening salvo. \"He played the race card,\" said <mark>Carr</mark> of Thomas's phrasing. The focus of the trial promptly turned away from sexual harassment and towards race. For this reason, perhaps, Thomas was cleared for his hearing and confirmed as a justice by a vote of 52-48, the narrowest margin to date. Hill returned to her teaching position at the University of Oklahoma soon after the trial. Today, Hill speaks on sexual harassment, using her experiences as a vehicle. She engaged the audience in a Q & A session following the film screening. One female audience member expressed her shock at the blatant rudeness of committee members' questions: \"Has anyone apologized?\" Hill's response was at once illuminating, disappointing, and inspiring. \"No, no apologies,\" she said. \"[In] Washington, apologies are easy - they don't mean anything. What I want is action .\" She described her faith in the younger generation of female leaders and politicians, young women who could use her experience to move forward.

Although one of the accused, Rand Stevenson, testified Monday in Fort Macleod, the trial had to be adjourned after co-accused Brent Derricott was unable to attend court Tuesday due to an ongoing battle with a foot infection. It's the second time the trial has been adjourned because of Derricott's health; the first adjournment was Sept. 15 when Stevenson, Derricott and Robert Smylski were scheduled to begin their defence. <mark>Don Young</mark>, chief litigation counsel for the ASC, said Thursday he's prepared to delay the case in deference to Derricott's illness, but not indefinitely. \"At some point we need to continue the trial,\" he said. The three men face some 62 charges under the Alberta Securities Act relating to unauthorized trading in securities. Stevenson, 63, and Derricott, 62, are charged with trading in OCI Q Corp. securities without registration or a prospectus and making misleading or untrue statements to investors. Smylski, 64, is charged with failing to comply with a previous order by the Alberta Securities Commission. Only Stevenson is represented by a lawyer. The ASC alleges that $1.2 million was raised between 2009 and 2011 from more than 50 investors through loan agreements with six-month terms, with the promise of returns of up to 150 times the loan amount. The funds were purportedly to be used to obtain the release of a billion-dollar inheritance connected to the late president Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. The Crown says many investors, who have not seen any of the promised returns on their money, had no idea their money was being used to cover the accused's personal expenses. Defence insists, however, investors have not been misled and the project is not a sham. During Monday's hearing much of Stevenson's testimony covered the project itself and information about the project contained in a binder. Defence successfully argued to have the contents of the binder placed under a publication ban.

Equals Doohan's Record Posted by: newsla on Oct 28, 2014 - 06:12 AM 2014 IHRA Hot Rod Champion <mark>Tony Jones</mark> Only this time, there was much, much more at stake. <mark>Jones</mark> secured his second ever victory in IHRA competition at the IHRA Summit Racing Equipment World Finals at Memphis International Raceway earlier this month, clinching the Hot Rod World Championship in the process when he bested Fowler for the second time in as many tries during the Summit Racing Equipment Tournament of Champions presented by AMSOIL. With a championship on the line, <mark>Jones</mark>, a newcomer to IHRA competition, bested Fowler with a .024 reaction time paired with a 10.911-second pass in the 10.90 index class at 140.39 mph while Fowler, who had been spot-on all afternoon, ran a tick too quick with a 10.898 at 142.81 mph. The win gave <mark>Jones</mark> a championship in his first season out with the IHRA after finishing third in Division 4, capping off what can only be described as a dream season for <mark>Jones</mark>. \"I have pinched myself a couple of times, but it still really hasn't sunk in just yet that I won it,\" <mark>Jones</mark> said. \"All afternoon I just took it a round at a time. After every round we kept thinking it is just three more rounds, just two more rounds and then just one more round. In the winner's circle, my buddy looked at me and simply said\" zero more rounds' and it sort of clicked that we had just won it. \"After a long afternoon that included wins over the best-of-the-best in IHRA's Hot Rod category, the irony did not escape <mark>Jones</mark> as he went up against Fowler for the second time this season in Memphis .\" I really didn't think I could beat him twice. The first time we went to Memphis and beat him, he treed me. This time he stuck me in the left lane and I ended up treeing him. It was a great race, there were a lot of nerves, but the good Lord took the anxiety away from me and we were able to get the win, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. <mark>Jones</mark>' afternoon included wins over two divisional champions and a divisional runner-up after he himself barely managed to hold on to a spot in the field. <mark>Jones</mark> entered the final race of the divisional season as the points leader in Division 4, but two poor showings plummeted him to third in the standings - the cutoff point to make the tournament. But in Memphis, <mark>Jones</mark> proved he belonged. Driving his bright yellow '67 Camaro, <mark>Jones</mark> bested Joe Tillman, Dakota Lowery and Ricky Roe to secure his place in the finals. All three rounds proved a challenge, with <mark>Jones</mark> using a .003 light to overcome Tillman's 10.915 in round one and a near-dead on 10.902 with a .009 light was needed in the semifinals to best Roe's 10.907 with a .009 tree, moving <mark>Jones</mark> into the championship bout. Championship runner-up Fowler had wins over <mark>Chris Dean</mark>, Tim Andersen and 2014 IHRA Sportsman Driver of the Year John Dustin, capping a great year for the Point Pleasant, West Virginia native who had one win and championship in Division 3 behind the wheel of the Friends of Coal sponsored 1980 Camaro .\" This whole thing has been like a dream come true. You pray for something like this, but people like me, we are just out here enjoying the sport. People like us just don't win these things, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said. Ironically, <mark>Jones</mark>' championship season almost didn't happen. It took the urging of longtime friend Roger Massey, himself an accomplished Top Sportsman racer, to get <mark>Jones</mark> out to his first IHRA event. From there, things just clicked for the Gilmer, Texas native .\" A friend of mine convinced me to give IHRA a try this year and from the very start, every time I went to a race, I found myself going rounds, \"<mark>Jones</mark> said .\" It was so different, so relaxing to run IHRA.
