They include the branch of <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian in Black Lion Street, Brighton, and more than 20 others, although three sites at Gatwick airport <mark>will</mark> stay open. Mr <mark>Oliver</mark>, 43, had pledged \u00a3 4 million as the business sought to attract more funding from investors. But today (Tuesday 21 May) the business was placed in administration, with specialist accountants from KPMG given the job of handling its affairs. Five years ago his Brighton branch of Recipease, a cooking school and deli in Western Road, also closed, with the last of the chain folding a year later in 2015. Mr <mark>Oliver</mark> said today: \"I am deeply saddened by this outcome and would like to thank all of the staff and our suppliers who have put their hearts and souls into this business for over a decade. I appreciate how difficult this is for everyone affected .\" I would also like to thank all the customers who have enjoyed and supported us over the last decade. It's been a real pleasure serving you. \"We launched <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian in 2008 with the intention of positively disrupting mid-market dining in the UK high street, with great value and much higher-quality ingredients, best-in-class animal welfare standards and an amazing team who shared my passion for great food and service. And we did exactly that .\" KPMG said: \"<mark>Will Wright</mark> and Mark Orton, from KPMG's restructuring practice, have been appointed joint administrators to <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark> Restaurant Group and its subsidiaries <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian, <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian Holdings, One New Change and Fifteen Restaurant .\" The group employs about 1,300 staff at 25 restaurants across the UK, including 22 under the <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian brand, in addition to <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark>'s Diner at Gatwick airport, Barbecoa and Fifteen London. \"The group recently undertook a process to secure additional investment in the business and, since the beginning of this year, <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark> has made additional funds of \u00a3 4 million available to support fundraising .\" However, with no suitable investment forthcoming and in light of the very difficult current trading environment, the directors resolved to appoint administrators. \"Following their appointment, all but three of the group's 25 eateries have closed .\" Both <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian restaurants and <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark>'s Diner at Gatwick airport <mark>will</mark> continue to trade in the short term while the joint administrators explore options for the sites. \"Regrettably, these closures <mark>will</mark> result in about 1,000 redundancies .\" <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark> Holdings has made arrangements to ensure all restaurant staff salaries <mark>will</mark> be paid up to the date of the administrators' appointment. \"The international restaurants trading as <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Italian, <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Pizzeria and <mark>Jamie</mark>'s Deli <mark>will</mark> continue to trade as normal and are not affected by the administration of the UK restaurant business .\" Mr <mark>Wright</mark> said: \"The current trading environment for companies across the casual dining sector is as tough as I've seen .\" The directors at <mark>Jamie Oliver</mark> Restaurant Group have worked tirelessly to stabilise the business against a backdrop of rising costs and brittle consumer confidence. \"However, after a sales process that sought to bring new investment into the business proved unsuccessful, the team took the incredibly difficult decision to appoint administrators .\" Unfortunately, with insufficient funds available to be able to trade the business in administration, all but the Gatwick airport restaurants have now closed. \"Our priority in the coming hours and days is to work with those employees who have been made redundant, providing any support and assistance they need .\" See also:"}, {"articleID": "2011040819_00092519_W", "names": {"Karen Leibovici": ["Q16151822", "Q3193114"]}, "date": "2011-04-08", "url":

delivering power to the industrial heartland. the city wants to see the line buried, warning of possible health impacts, poor esthetics and the potential for nearby property values to drop. the towers could be up to 24 stories high. \"one of the names that this is being called is the mother of all power lines, because? 24-stories outside your backyard is not something attractive, to say the least,\" coun. <mark>karen leibovici</mark> told a news conference friday. the proposal, a joint venture between epcor and and altalink called the heartland transmission project, is slated to go before the alberta utilities commission (auc) monday. the hearing, which will hear from one of the city's lawyers, is expected to run into may. the 65 km power line would deliver electricity from south edmonton to industrial users northeast of edmonton, running along the eastern portion of the transportation utility corridor. the project would cost about $580 million if the lines are above ground, nearly doubling to $1.1 billion if a portion is buried, said tim le riche, spokesman for the project. \"we've gone through an extensive public consultation,\" said le riche, noting there was contact with over 200,000 stakeholders. \"after gathering all of the information, we have determined that when all factors are considered, it is our position that the best option, with the overall least impact, is an overhead line .\" however, the group has included information to the auc about burying a portion of the line, he said. epcor and altalink have countered claims of potential health risks and significantly lower property values. if the line is not buried, the city wants it to run along a second proposed route, immediately west of the city, through parkland and sturgeon counties.

bill of rights\" in a public event wednesday. photo courtesy of the perriello office. president obama's patient protection and affordable care act was officially put into effect yesterday. proponents of the health care reform law emphasize the protections for privately insured consumers outlined in the \"patient's bill of rights .\" congressman tom perriello, d-charlottesville, highlighted those key patient rights and protections in a wednesday statement to the press. for example, virginians will have protective provisions against the denial of coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, the arbitrary cancellation of health coverage and lifetime limits on health coverage. other benefits include the rights patients will have \"to key preventive services without deductible or co-payments\" and to choose their own doctors within their insurer networks. perriello publicly discussed the \"patient's bill of rights\" wednesday at events in charlottesville and ferrum, va. \"we met parents with kids who have chronic illnesses,\" said <mark>michael kelly</mark>, deputy press secretary for the periello campaign, adding that those parents now have the freedom to make critical decisions about their healthcare under the new law. perriello and other supporters of the health care reform law emphasize that the \"reforms? put patients and doctors, not the health insurance companies, back in charge of health care decisions,\" according to perriello's press release. nevertheless, robert hurt, perriello's challenger in the upcoming congressional midterm election, believes that the health care reform bill is more detrimental than beneficial for virginians. \"robert believes that the government takeover of health care should be repealed and replaced,\" hurt campaign spokesperson amanda hennenberg said. \"it's no surprise that congressman perriello continues to champion? government takeover of health care that raises rates and taxes, kills jobs and adds burdensome costs onto the backs of small businesses and cuts medicare by $500 billion .\" other sources have shown that the health care reform policy could have some negative effects. the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced tuesday that 1.2 million seniors will be dropped from the medicare advantage or medicare prescription drug plan that is currently in place. in addition, small-town doctors who rely on medicare patients may suffer from these reported effects. despite how polarized views on the bill can be, isaac wood, media representative at the center for politics and a former cavalier daily opinion columnist, said he believes the health care policy's recent implementation will not affect the upcoming congressional election. \"i feel like many people have already made up their mind about the health care reform bill one way or another,\" wood said. \"unless they seem personally affected or changed, i don't think you will see a lot of change in the polls based on this alone .\" a new benenson strategy group poll released tuesday shows that democrat tom perriello and republican robert hurt are statistically tied. the poll revealed that 44 percent and 46 percent of likely general election voters would vote for perriello and hurt, respectively. wood called this poll more accurate than some previous polls that showed larger margins. \"anyone living in this district knows that [the election] is not a blowout - the margin is really small,\" he said. the congressional midterm election will take place nov. 2. mail (will not be published) (required) is

folks, this is a pretty tough way for somebody to start their head coaching career. see, you're the new head football coach at weber state university, but they've chosen to put that iffy qualifier \"interim\" in front of your title after you were suddenly thrust into the job when the other guy abruptly bailed for a better gig. so now it's turned into one of those classic good news/bad news scenarios: the good news is congratulations, you're the wildcats' head coach; the bad news is, uh, sorry, but your first two games are on the road against a couple of perennially strong football bowl subdivision programs. yep, we're talking fresno state and byu. hey, good luck with that! that's the difficult challenge jody sears inherited when he took over the wsu reins in late-april after john l. smith bolted from his alma mater for the greener pastures of the university of arkansas. the wildcats opened their season last saturday with a lopsided 37-10 loss at fresno. and this weekend, they'll make the bus ride south to provo to face the cougars, who whipped that \"other\" wsu team (washington state) last week, 30-6. while sears admits he might've had a \"holy, crap!\" moment or two when he first glanced at the wildcats' early season schedule, he's not looking around for a white towel to throw in when saturday's game kicks off at lavell edwards stadium - marking weber state's first game against byu since 1979. \"that's the hand you're dealt, and there's no sense crying and whining about it,\" sears said. \"it is what it is .\" when i was at eastern washington, we opened up at oregon

The ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, 57, served just under two years in the post, after her arrival was delayed by a prolonged confirmation process. Analysts say her departure will be deeply felt by both US and Mexican officials: She was one of the most experienced Latin America experts in the State Department, having spent most of her 31 years there, focusing on the region. \"I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,\" Jacobson wrote. \"This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the US-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment .\" Advertisement The Trump administration has selected a nominee to replace Jacobson but has not released the name, according to a US official with knowledge of the decision who was not authorized to comment publicly and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity.

Sign up for more newsletters here Jacobson leaves at a tense moment in relations between Mexico and the United States, with President Trump vowing to have Mexico pay to build a wall between the countries, pledging to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, and promising to deport millions of Mexicans who crossed the border illegally. There was also a testy phone call between Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico that derailed tentative plans for the two leaders to meet after Trump refused to drop his demand that Mexico fund the border wall. For Jacobson, the ambassadorial post was the culmination of a career largely centered in Washington, where she was most recently the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs. As a member of the State Department's Civil Service--as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats--it was highly unusual for Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico. But Jacobson's supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies. Advertisement Former President Barack Obama named Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long. Trump's election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over 25 years--ones that Jacobson had helped foster. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern--and anger--about the new president's tough talk. At the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Jacobson with less authority. Officials in Mexico, as well as former colleagues, lamented her departure, calling it the latest blow to strained relations. \"No career official has more consummately understood US-Mexico relations,\" said <mark>Carlos Pascual</mark>, a former US ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine. \"She grounded American policy in the belief that, as neighbors, the US and Mexico will gain most from using the vast resources of both countries to confront shared problems together .\" Advertisement Jacobson will be leaving a State Department that has seen an exodus of foreign service officers. Among those leaving are several high-ranking officials with deep experience in Latin America, including Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the third-highest-ranking official in the State Department. Shannon, the undersecretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala, and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month."}]
