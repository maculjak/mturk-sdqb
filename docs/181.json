including three three-pointers - in notre dame's 51-42 victory. \"we moved on from the providence game. in the big east, once you take a loss, you have to bounce back. i think we did that pretty well tonight .\" notre dame missed its first 12 shots and 17 of its first 18 to fall behind 19-3 with 7:08 left in the first half after tray woodall converted two free throws as a result of a mike brey technical. brey was willing to try anything, including irrationality, during the second-to-last tv timeout of the first half. \"i didn't talk to (the team) much because i was a raving lunatic through most of the timeout after the technical,\" brey said. but the impact of brey's emotion was not lost on the players. \"we just knew coach had our back,\" grant said. \"we always knew that he knew we had a chance. down 19-3, we still could play defense and get back in the game .\" the panthers would score just three more points the rest of the half, and then a mere 20 in the second half, which was just one more point than notre dame scored during it's star-crossed first half. \"the one thing i kept telling them was,\" look, we are defending pretty well. just hang in there. we're only giving them one shot. we're going to get a spurt here,' \"brey said. the irish needed a jump-start offensively, and pat connaughton provided it. back-to-back threes within 31 seconds of one another suddenly made it a 19-9 game .\" once pat knocked in those two threes, we knew we were going to be able to get back in this game, \"said <mark>jack cooley</mark>, who finished with 13 points and nine rebounds .\" it was late in the half and they only had 19. we were 1-for-18 and that's just dismal shooting. we weren't going to keep shooting that poorly. we knew we had a run in us. \"the atmosphere in the petersen events center began to shift. with each panther miss - they were just 8-of-23 (.348) from the field in the first half themselves - the angst in the home crowd's moans became evident .\" i was just trying to keep our guys fired up because that felt like we tied it quite frankly, \"said brey of his emotion following connaughton's rapid-fire three-pointers to pull the irish to within 10 .\" the climate changed in the building. the vibe changed. our body language changed, and we were able to get a few things offensively that kind of set a tone for us in the second half to have some offensive confidence. \"the irish would take the lead at the 14:41 mark of the second half when a three-point attempt by grant from the left of the circle hit the front of the rim and then slid through the rim for a 29-28 notre dame lead. pittsburgh would regain the lead moments later. but when eric atkins scored on a drive to the bucket with 10:53 left, the irish had the lead for good .\" you just keep playing, \"said atkins of notre dame's 1-of-18 shooting start .\" we were getting some good looks. we missed some easy lay-ups. we just kept saying that we've got to keep guarding them. we just really started to buckle down. i think our defense gave us confidence. \"the more the irish struggled offensively in the first half, the better their defense on the panthers .? pittsburgh's shooting in the second half didn't improve. in fact, they duplicated their 8-of-23 shooting in the second half while the irish shot a sizzling 12-of-20 (.600), including 4-of-6 from three-point range. three were by grant .\" once i hit that three, my confidence was back and the team was really hyped because we finally got a lead, \"grant said .? atkins' driving lay-up put the irish up, 33-32. <mark>tom knight</mark> hit a 17-foot jumper from the corner. after <mark>james robinson</mark> connected on a jump shot, the irish would score the next eight points on a three-pointer by grant, a <mark>cooley</mark> basket with an assist from grant, and another three-pointer by grant at the 4:46 mark that suddenly gave the irish a nine-point bulge .\" we got some stuff in transition, \"brey said .\" once we got a couple in transition, you got a deep breath. and then jerian was really able to get off ball screens and do stuff. \"jerian and eric, after the first 10 minutes, were fabulous. in the second half, they controlled the tempo. then in the last seven minutes we were burning and getting great stuff at the end of the clock .\" the fact that the panthers missed all eight of their three-point attempts was no coincidence. beyond woodall and lamar patterson, the panthers don't have consistent outside firepower, and woodall missed all four of his attempts and patterson didn't attempt one. \"we did a good job scouting them, knowing who we could help off of,\" atkins said. \"i always had the guy that wasn't the best three-point shooter, so i could dig around a little bit. i stayed in the lane when woodall would get in there. we never left woodall or patterson, but everybody else (we could), and we could really pack the lane in and make it tough for their bigs to get an easy look .\" it was really hard for them to score after they got to 19, and that really gave us confidence to get on a run. \"<mark>cooley</mark> said the irish wiped the slate clean after the loss to providence .\" once you lose the first one, there's nothing you can do but turn to the second one, \"<mark>cooley</mark> philosophized .\" to handle it the way we did and with that much adversity is huge. \"one shot at a time, one possession at a time, one victory snatched from the jaws of defeat."}, {"articleID": "2016092517_00968798_W", "names": {"Chris Pratt": ["Q503706", "Q5107796"], "Clint Eastwood": ["Q2979323", "Q43203"]}, "date": "2016-09-25", "url": "http://www.kutv.com:80/news/entertainment/the-magnificent-seven-rides-again-storks-struggles-to-get-off-the-ground", "content": "\"The Magnificent Seven' rides again,\" Storks' struggles to get off the ground by Ryan Painter Denzel Washington stars in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Columbia Pictures' THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

For more of episode 2, we saw the main point of contention be the arrival of Josh Murray, where he in turn ended up taking Amanda Stanton on a date. This upset Nick Viall greatly, given that he was already starting up a relationship with her. He now feels like he's lost her, and he has to figure out what happened. What could he do to ensure that he figures all of this out? The synopsis below offers up a few clues--it's not confirmed that it is about Nick, but at the same time there aren't many other candidates at present it could be in reference to unless someone starts to date Carly Waddell in the near future after she spent time with Evan Bass:\" When one bachelor knows he is going home since he was recently dumped, he plants a fake date card addressed to him so he can tell his original love interest how he feels. The only glitch is the beauty is very much taken and is making out with her hunky guy when the desperate guy approaches. What will the notorious bachelor do when his woman is stolen from him mid-makeout? Will the underdog prevail? \"Ultimately, we think the words\" notorious bachelor \"are the biggest clue that this is Josh. What else makes sense?

In June you're a test-ready warrior. By September, you might feel like a foggy-headed dunce. Sociologists refer to this decline as the summer setback, and it's widely cited as one of the most corrosive factors in the achievement gap between low - and high-income students. While low-income kids play games and watch cartoons in the summer, high-income kids go to camp, visit museums, and continue learning. Over time, those incremental advantages can spell the difference between who gets placed into elite colleges and high-paying jobs and who drops out. Some parents and schools have tried to help kids overcome the summer setback with enrichment classes. But others have taken a more radical approach, calling instead for a complete overhaul of the school calendar so that kids attend school year-round. Between 1985 and 2011, the number of US schools with year-round learning increased ninefold, bringing the current total to just shy of 4,000. According to recent research, however, the trend might be misguided. Year-round school doesn't help with the effects of inequality or erase the summer setback all kids tend to experience. In the worst cases, it actually hurts kids' education. What people get wrong about year-round school The biggest misconception with year-round school is that kids spend more time in the classroom. Parents hear \"no summer break\" and immediately think kids are getting an extra three months of school. That's not necessarily true. In most cases, kids who attend year-round schools learn for six weeks at a time before taking three-week breaks. Their \"summer break\" lasts only a month. They still learn for 180 days, just like traditional schools. Paul von Hippel, an expert on educational inequality at the University of Texas at Austin, argues that kids in schools using either calendar models - whether they're from low-income, middle-income, or high-income families - end up performing roughly the same on standardized tests. There's no added drawback to summer vacation that year-round school protects kids from, he tells Business Insider. A three-week break might be shorter than a three-month break, but compared to how long kids are in school before the break, the setbacks add up equally. \"It is a bit like the race between tortoise and hare,\" von Hippel wrote in a recent review of the research on year-round school, \"except that, in this case, the race ends in a tie .\" Still, people like to blame summer vacation because they see kids spending a huge chunk of time away from a classroom and think that's doing the most damage. Often, the real culprit is economic in nature. \"The differences you see between upper-middle class families and poor families aren't differences that go away if you rearrange the school calendar,\" von Hippel says. \"The summer provides a window into what those differences are like, but those differences exist every weekend. Whenever children are out of school, their environments are less equal .\" Richard Kahlenberg, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, agrees that rearranging the time isn't nearly as important as making smarter use of it. \"It doesn't get at that issue of making sure that low-income students, when they're not in school, have lots of opportunities for enrichment,\" he tells Business Insider. Too many kids, too little time Perceived increases in achievement aren't the only reason a school district might push to switch. One of the few benefits of a year-round system is that it relieves the burdens of overcrowding. In Wake County, North Carolina, for example, attendance rose by nearly two-thirds between 1995 and 2007. As a result, 37 of the county's 177 schools now rely on a \"multi-track\" model in which students are split into four groups. Each group is staggered so while one group is on break, the others are in session, and the building doesn't sit empty for three months. \"It really is true that the traditional calendar is somewhat inefficient,\" von Hippel says. Multi-track schools might have to pay more during the summer to keep the lights and A/C on, but that's much cheaper than building a brand-new school. In any case, the benefit that gets passed on to students is still marginal. The lessons from Wake County don't translate to schools where overcrowding isn't an issue. And research shows the switch can frustrate parents who have kids in schools using both schedules. Year-round school can even cause property values to decline if families and teachers relocate to keep their summers. As von Hippel writes, \"Although surveys can be informative, behaviors show teachers and parents voting with their feet. Actions speak louder than words .\" How to solve the right problems If there's any hope for year-round school it's that multiple three-week breaks might give teachers an easier time to teach additional classes than a full summer, when kids have fully checked out. Neither Kahlenberg nor von Hippel could say for sure, however, because there isn't any research on it. What the research does suggest is schools should do whatever they can to close the gaps created by poverty. They can hold field trips to museums, aquariums, and national parks during the summer so kids don't equate enrichment with summer school. And during the year they can focus more on personalized learning, which some schools have used to great success. If governments want to stop the achievement gap from widening (or close it altogether), they can offer greater access to pre-K. Or, if they want to go by the latest research, they could just give poor families more money, which may raise achievement even more than early education. Whatever the solution, implying that the three-month period between June and September is what leads some to Harvard and others to hard times ignores a much bigger problem. Schools need level playing fields, not cleverly designed calendars.

Mr <mark>Casey</mark>, who was projected to come runner-up in the Irish presidential race after Michael D Higgins, claimed on Saturday morning that people voted for him because he spoke for \"middle Ireland\" who were working and \"paying the bills\". Mr <mark>Casey</mark> previously made comments that Travellers should not be recognised as an ethnic minority, because they are \"basically people camping in someone else's land\" , and the group are \"not paying their fair share of taxes in society\". He had come under increased scrutiny in presidential debates and had some of his comments labelled \"populist\" and \"racist\" by other candidates. He was also compared to former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Kathleen Lawrence, who works at Traveller outreach programme Pavee Point, said that Mr <mark>Casey</mark> had used an already disenfranchised community to bolster his lead in the polls. \"The fact that he garnered 20% of votes is disappointing but it's not surprising given his comments,\" she said. \"I think now we need to look at the fact that 20% bought into his message .\" I think we need to target those people to help them and change the way politics is being done. \"People are drained, working full time and barely scraping by and that's awful, but the fact <mark>Peter Casey</mark> used an ethnic minority to make up the blame, that is disturbing .\" I think what needs to happen is we need to tap into why people voted for him, we can't let this pass by. \"We need to put protocols in place that would prevent people like <mark>Peter Casey</mark> and any other potential candidate at all levels, we need anti-racism protocols in place that they have to sign up to, to make sure that they don't use minorities to further their own political agenda .\" Ms Lawrence said the feeling in her family was one of fear after Mr <mark>Casey</mark> said he had received thousands of letters of support after making his views on Travellers known. \"I can't speak for all Travellers, but amongst my own family there was a lot of fear around what would happen if he got in,\" she said. \"We're already marginalised, we're already facing extreme discrimination and extensive cuts, people were feeling like,\" Well, what more can we handle?' \"I don't know what he stood for, all we know is he spoke about Travellers and people on welfare for the last three weeks .\" A good portion of his votes came from his Traveller comments. \"I know he's trying to convince people that isn't the case, but he's really trying to kid himself .\" The reason he continued in the race was because he received emails of support after the comments, he said that himself. \"On Saturday, Archbishop of Cashel and Emly Kieran O\u2019Reilly expressed concern over hurt caused by the public discussion during the election campaign .\" In recent weeks I was alarmed by some of the inflammatory language used during the public discourse which formed part of this election campaign, \"he said .\" Feedback that I have received from members of the Travelling community, and from those dependent on financial assistance from the state in order to survive, has confirmed my concerns. \"Ill-informed and inflammatory language has caused real hurt, humiliation and heartache.

It has been particularly damaging to the Traveller community which has been endeavouring to grow and preserve its ethnic identity as part of our society .\" He asked that those who engage in projects around Traveller health and well-being redouble their efforts. 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2016070705_00083543_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2016-07-07", "url": "http://vindy.com/news/2016/jul/07/gingrich-joins-trump-for-rally-near-cinc/", "content": "Gingrich joins <mark>Trump</mark> for rally near Cincinnati news @ vindy.com SHARONVILLE Presumptive Republican presidential nominee <mark>Donald Trump</mark> used a stop in southwestern Ohio Wednesday night to call Democrat Hillary Clinton \"crooked .\" But <mark>Trump</mark> had nice things to say about his grandchildren, Republican U.S. Sen.
