nov 11, 2012, 12:33 ist agency: reuters apple inc and htc corp announced on saturday a global patent settlement and 10-year licensing agreement that ends one of the first major conflagrations of the smartphone patent wars. apple sued htc in 2010, accusing the taiwanese handset company of infringing on the iphone maker's patented technology. it was apple's first major legal salvo against a manufacturer that used google's android operating system. though apple and htc did not disclose specific terms of the deal. in a joint statement, apple chief executive <mark>tim cook</mark> said he was glad to reach a settlement. \"we will continue to stay laser focused on product innovation,\" <mark>cook</mark> said. htc chief executive <mark>peter chou</mark> said his company was pleased to resolve the dispute so it could \"focus on innovation instead of litigation .\" since apple first sued htc, its smartphone patent war has engulfed competitors like samsung electronics co ltd and google's motorola mobility unit. the iphone maker won a $1.05 billion verdict against samsung in august, while litigation against motorola has failed to produce any decisive wins. however, apple had the most success against htc when it came to using litigation to actually disrupt the flow of products into the crucial us market. late last year, the us international trade commission ruled that htc had infringed upon one of four patents apple had disputed and imposed a sales ban on some of the taiwanese maker's phones. though htc said it had devised a technical workaround to apple's patents, the company announced in may that shipments of its phones were being held up by u.s. customs officials. once one of the industry's high flyers, htc has been badly hit by competition from apple and samsung. last month htc forecast a 14.5% fall in revenue in the fourth quarter from the third, worse than analyst forecasts and the second straight quarterly decline this year.", "articleID":

of the second world war is to have a hollywood film made about him. wojtek, a syrian brown bear who drank two bottles of beer a day, fought alongside polish soldiers during the war before spending his final years at edinburgh zoo. he was adopted by soldiers of the 22 nd artillery supply company of the polish ii corps in 1942 and helped move ammunition during the battle of monte cassino. wojtek is reported to have carried shells at the battle of monte cassino <mark>brendan foley</mark>, a writer and director from belfast, has bought the film rights for wojtek the bear and plans to bring his story to the big screen with ned dowd, who worked as the producer on <mark>mel gibson</mark>'s apocalypto. mr <mark>foley</mark> said: \"it is an amazing story - a bit like war horse but with humour and pathos alongside the action, and the bear is a real character .\" one of the studios believed to be interested is steven spielberg's dreamworks, which made war horse. mr <mark>foley</mark> said: \"making a major film is always a long process, but we very much hope that some of the work and the locations will be in scotland, where the bear and his soldier minders ended up after the war .\" wojtek was an orphaned cub found by a boy in hamadan in iran who sold him for two tins of meat to polish soldiers stationed nearby. these soldiers had been held in russian internment camps but were released after hitler began his invasion of russia in june 1941. they were now heading for north africa with the allied forces opposing rommel's tanks in the desert. wojtek grew up among the men who fed him condensed milk from an empty vodka bottle and later honey, marmalade and syrup. the large bear lived in a tent with the men, drank two bottles of ale a day and used to swallow lit cigarette and exhale smoke as his party trick. he was taught how to salute when greeted and was enlisted as a private soldier with an official rank and number. wojtek became known as a legend when he helped in the battle of monte cassino in italy where he used his giant paws to carry heavy boxes of mortar shells from trucks to gun emplacements. the image of him carrying a shell became the regiment's official emblem. when the war ended in 1945, wojtek was dispatched to berwickshire with some of his polish comrades-in-arms. he was then taken into the care of edinburgh zoo in 1947 when the soldiers were demobbed as an attraction until he died there in 1963. it is believed that soldiers would continue to visit him and occasionally enter his enclosure to hug him. aileen orr, the author of wojtek the bear who sold the rights to mr <mark>foley</mark>, discovered the story growing up in berwickshire and by visiting edinburgh zoo. she is part of a trust that is raising funds to create a statue of wojtek with a polish soldier that was his minder. they want the statue to be placed on a plinth made from stone quarried from the polish soldiers' former camp in berwickshire and displayed in the scottish capital. she said: \"i knew after speaking to one of the poles who was in the camp that i wanted this statue to be a moment in time reflecting what the bear did hear in the scottish borders .\" he was free to run around; he was humanised and had no idea he was a bear; he thought he was a soldier, and so he could wander down the road with one of the men and just as villagers stopped to speak, he would stop and listen to the exchange. \"after a while, this was not deemed to be a remarkable thing as everyone got used to seeing him. top stories. you can follow any responses to this

already started their season. despite my excitement for the season, it sort of sneaked up on me. brendan sherrer is gone. other than that the entire team is intact for this year which is already upon us. this was the first game with <mark>brad jackson</mark> as an assistant coach on the washington sidelines after spending nearly three decades as the head coach at western washington university, where this most recent season they won the division-ii national championship. <mark>jackson</mark> brought the high post offense to washington. lorenzo romar said that the team had some shadows of the high post already, but the main offense in years past was the motion offense; i like to call the half-court offenses of the lorenzo romar era the \"dribble around and see what happens\" offense. you see, i have a gift for naming such things. my other title for the offense was the \"just kidding you can stand there and we probably won't score anyways because we actually aren't running a play\" offense. bullet holes are how these go right? bullet holes we shall have! my biggest question going into the season was how will the team assimilate to the high post offense. it seems the team is making the transition quite well. there will always be growing pains, but they were kept to a minimum. granted, the team was able to practice their offense in europe for a series of games which means they dealt with quite a few of their growing pains overseas. in this high post offense i can see jernard jarreau shining. he has guard skills in a big man's body. he will have the ball in his hands quite frequently and will be forced to make decisions. those decisions very well may be better than those of most big men. speaking of jarreau, he had a strong game. maybe he didn't have a statsheet-stuffing game, but he played well. he showed off that he has a great handle for someone his size due to his history as a guard. he can get into the lane with his surprising quickness and dribbling ability to go along with his length. he also uses his abilities in other ways, such as shutting down passing lanes with his aforementioned length and quickness. he does not have great lateral quickness and that will lead to him getting beat off the dribble more frequently than most players. overall it was a good game for him. c.j. wilcox showed how much the team will lean on him this season for scoring. he lead the team in scoring with 22 points and hit four of his five three-point attempts. he showed that he is more than a shooter. he handled the ball in transition, scored inside and distributed the ball (one assist doesn't give his improvement passing justice). he had six rebounds, very important considering the wing-rebounding lost by the departure of ross. andrew andrews is quick. he is going to be a venoy overton-type defender. not a venoy overton-type offender. i hope. he has bought in to romar's ball-pressure defense and will get minutes thanks to that. he can get into the lane and showed off his athleticism on the and-one dunk attempt late in the second half. aziz n'daiye is important to this team. he will be extremely important until", "articleID":

barack obama said wednesday he's seen no evidence that national security was damaged by the revelations that ended his cia director's career and imperil that of his afghan war commander. but the president said he is reserving judgment about how the fbi has handled the investigation that began in the summer but didn't reach his desk until after last week's election. \"i have a lot of confidence, generally, in the fbi,\" obama said, qualifying his words of support for the agency and its actions in the case. as obama spoke about the scandal from the white house, legislators on capitol hill were grilling fbi and cia officials privately about the same issues: whether national security was jeopardized by the case and why they didn't know about the investigation sooner. \"i have no evidence at this point, from what i've seen, that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,\" obama said at his first postelection news conference. as for the fbi's handling of the matter, obama said: \"my expectation is that they follow the protocols that they've already established. one of the challenges here is that we're not supposed to meddle in criminal investigations, and that's been our practice .\" federal law enforcement officials have said the fbi didn't inform the white house and congress sooner about the original investigation because of rules set up after the watergate scandal to prevent interference in criminal investigations and that lawmakers weren't given notice of potential national security problems because the bureau had quickly resolved them. cia director david petraeus resigned friday, two days after the white house was notified that he'd acknowledged having an affair with his biographer, paula broadwell. the fbi's investigation of the matter began last summer when tampa, fla., socialite jill kelley turned over anonymous emails that had been sent to her and gen. <mark>john allen</mark>, the top u.s. commander in afghanistan. the first anonymous email was sent to <mark>allen</mark> in may, under the pseudonym \"kelleypatrol,\" and he forwarded it to kelley. that email warned <mark>allen</mark> to stay away from kelley, according to a person close to kelley who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the emails is ongoing. that same email - later traced to broadwell - said the writer knew about a future meeting <mark>allen</mark> and kelley had scheduled. <mark>allen</mark> thought the email was a joke or that it was possibly from kelley because he didn't know how anyone else would know about their planned meeting, the person close to kelley said. kelley was a friend of <mark>allen</mark> and petraeus, both of whom she had met in tampa when the men served there. one of the federal law enforcement officials confirmed wednesday that fbi agents were concerned that somebody was tracking the movements of <mark>allen</mark> and petraeus, raising the possibility of a national security breach. kelley's complaints about the threatening emails triggered the fbi investigation that led to the resignation of petraeus and the inquiry into her communications with <mark>allen</mark>. officials said broadwell apparently saw kelley as a rival for petraeus' affections. the official also said wednesday that broadwell sent emails to a couple of other senior military officials besides petraeus and <mark>allen</mark>. the official characterized the emails as an attempt to undermine kelley's reputation. the fbi found a substantial number of classified documents on broadwell's computer, and she has told agents that took classified documents out of secure government buildings, according to the official. on monday, the fbi also found classified documents in the search of broadwell's house in charlotte, n.c., the official said. broadwell had agreed to the search and had told agents in advance that there would be more of them there. a lawyer for <mark>allen</mark> released a statement promising the general would cooperate fully with the defense department inspector general's investigation. \"to the extent that there are questions about certain communications by general <mark>allen</mark>, he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible,\" said col. <mark>john baker</mark>, chief defense counsel of the marine corps. <mark>allen</mark> has denied any wrongdoing. in early june, kelley herself received the first of as many as five emails sent from different anonymous accounts alleging that she was up to no good, the person close to kelley said. one of those mentioned petraeus by name. by the end of june or early july, kelley contacted an fbi agent in tampa she had met at least a year earlier, which began the agency's investigation of the matter. the new york times identified the agent as frederick w. humphries, 47, a veteran counterterrorism investigator in the tampa office. kelley met humphries when she attended the bureau's citizens' academy, an fbi program aimed at showing members of the public at least some of what the fbi does and how it works, the person close to kelley said. officials who have seen the communications between <mark>allen</mark> and kelley on wednesday described some of the emails as \"suggestive,\" and said their release would be embarrassing for the general. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly. with broadwell and kelley suddenly in the center of the storm, small details suddenly became topics for discussion. word surfaced wednesday that kelley's pass to enter macdill air force base in florida had been indefinitely suspended, a decision made at the base level. pentagon spokesman lt. col. steven warren said kelley still can enter the base but must report to the visitor center and sign in like others without a pass. separately, a u.s. official said the army has suspended broadwell's security clearance. as a former army intelligence officer, she held a high security clearance. the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. broadwell, who lives in charlotte, n.c., was spotted in washington at her brother's home late tuesday. her listing in her high school yearbook in bismarck, n.d., as \"most likely to be remembered\" took on new meaning. fbi director robert mueller and deputy director sean joyce met privately with legislators on both sides of the capitol on wednesday to explain how the investigation unfolded. they met first with senate intelligence committee chairwoman dianne feinstein, d-calif., and ranking republican saxby chambliss of georgia, then crossed the capitol to meet with the house intelligence committee. acting cia director michael morell went before the house panel next, after meeting a day earlier with top senate intelligence officials to explain the cia's take on events that led to petraeus' resignation. the questioning on capitol hill will continue on thursday. rep. dutch ruppersberger, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said a hearing scheduled for thursday to explore the government's handling of the attacks on the u.s. consulate in benghazi, libya, also would touch on the petraeus affair, covering how and why the fbi investigation was started. he said mueller, joyce and morell only began to answer those questions wednesday. \"how did you get the information, what's the basis for the investigation, who did you talk to, were you working with prosecutors, all those issues have to be looked at,\" including why the intelligence committees weren't told of the investigation until just before petraeus' resignation, he said. petraeus will testify friday before the house intelligence committee about libya, panel spokeswoman susan phalen said. lawmakers are also concerned over reports that broadwell had classified information on her laptop, though fbi investigators say they concluded there was no security breach. fbi agents who contacted petraeus told him that sensitive, possibly classified documents related to afghanistan were found on her computer, the general's associates said. he assured investigators they did not come from him, and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there. one associate also said petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified, although they might have still been marked \"secret .\" feinstein, asked by reporters if there was a national security breach with the petraeus affair, said she had \"no evidence that there was at this time .\" feinstein said that petraeus himself would testify before congress - but not about the affair. she said he had agreed to appear to talk about the libya attack on sept. 11 that killed the u.s. ambassador and three other americans, but she said no date had been set. <mark>allen</mark> has been allowed to stay in his job as commander of the afghan war, providing a leading voice in white house discussions on how many troops will remain in afghanistan - and for what purposes - after the u.s.-led combat operation ends in 2014. but obama has put on hold <mark>allen</mark>'s nomination to become the next commander of u.s. european command as well as the nato supreme allied commander in europe until pentagon investigators are able to sift through the 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails that involve <mark>allen</mark> and kelley. defense secretary leon panetta, at a news conference in perth, australia, said, \"no one should leap to any conclusions\" about <mark>allen</mark>, and said he is fully confident in <mark>allen</mark>'s ability to continue to lead in afghanistan. he added that putting a hold on <mark>allen</mark>'s european command nomination was the \"prudent\" thing to do.", "articleID": "2012111501_00072203_W", "names": {"John Allen": ["Q1254163", "Q16020150",
