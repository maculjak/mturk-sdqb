past monday were inconsistent w/our editorial standards + practices\". really, npr? so your standards do not let people speak the truth? the standard liberal/regressive philosophy mirrors the obama doctrine: i have to support juan on this. i fly a lot. i get nervous as well when i see muslims dressed as juan says. he speaks the truth on this. typical progressive tactic, tow our line or you're done, there is no room for people that do not think exactly as we do. so much for free speech. while i very seldom agree with what mr. <mark>williams</mark> has to say, he certainly has the right to say it and this sort of treatment by a \"media\" outlet is ridiculous. there were no disparaging remarks made, mr. <mark>williams</mark> simply spoke the truth without any politically correct spin, and stated how he felt on the subject. is it possible that we're witnessing yet another \"transformation\" of a liberal into a conservative? if so, then juan williams will be greatly welcomed into the black conservative community that already counts <mark>michael steele</mark>, dr. <mark>walter williams</mark>, larry elder, justice clarence thomas, et.al. among its many members. there's 30 black republicans running for congress. you don't hear about them from the liberal media; you just hear about the naacp accusing the tea party of \"racism\". npr is one of the biggest supporters of \"all things obama\". npr cannot allow juan williams to remain on staff and although i disagree with npr on almost every subject they discuss on their network, including what they term \"entertainment\" - they couldn't lean any further to the left or they would topple as they are now exposed for their progressive philosophy. npr told its employees to not attend the <mark>jon stewart</mark> rally. how could you possibly dislike npr? npr is not liberal, they are you. <mark>williams</mark> responded: \"look, bill, i'm not a bigot. you know the kind of books i've written about the civil rights movement in this country. but when i get on the plane, i got to tell you, if i see people who are in muslim garb and i think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as muslims, i

fight over pot starts to heat up: / c/a/2010 / 10/23/ba8o1g0foe. dtl no tv ads. no billboards. just a lot of news conferences, endorsement announcements, mailings by special-interest groups and phone calls to voters. that's what the battle has consisted of so far in the campaigns around the lowest-key, highest-interest election issue on the nov. 2 ballot - proposition 19, which would legalize personal marijuana use for adults. and that's pretty much the game plan from here to the end. the very subject of legalizing marijuana has been in the public discourse for so many decades that many people apparently have their minds made up already, observers and combatants say. so the main challenge has been to fire up the converted on both sides, while educating voters in the middle to shore up the margins. a public policy institute of california survey released thursday showed 49 percent of californians saying they would vote no on the measure, and 44 percent saying they'd vote yes. that's a turnaround from a field poll last month that had prop. 19 up, 49 percent to 42 percent. a smattering of smaller polls disagree on which side is ahead. what this means, in the home stretch toward election day, is that prop. 19 is still up for grabs. \"it's probably going to be a squeaker one way or another,\" said tom angell, media director for prop. 19. \"our message is harder to get out, because it's got a little more complexity, but we're making headway,\" said roger salazar, spokesman for the no on prop. 19 effort. \"the other side is working overtime to generate some press, and so are we .\" no ads the most striking thing about the campaign is the lack of the advertisements, even though polls indicate prop. 19 is by far the most recognizable measure on the ballot. it's also been drawing international headlines because it would make california the first place in the united states to legalize recreational pot. \"we're seeing lots of ads for everything else on the ballot, aren't we? but not prop. 19,\" said martin carcieri, a political science professor at san francisco state university. \"it tells us that this is such a touchy subject you have to be careful .\" that, plus neither side has a ton of money, and ads are expensive. \"it generally costs about $2 million a week to run television ads statewide in a california election, and so far neither campaign has been able to attract a lot of cash. according to the california secretary of state's office, the anti-prop. 19 side had raised just $250,000 as of friday. the measure's proponents had pulled together $2.8 million, which could position them for a last-minute flurry of ads. by contrast, more than $22 million has been raised by the pro and con sides around proposition 24, which would repeal a number of tax breaks for big corporations. the main weapons in the battle over prop. 19 have been news coverage, endorsement announcements and opinion pieces in newspapers and on blogs. representatives of both sides, including police, politicians and educators, have debated each other in hundreds of settings .\" fired up' \"people are really fired up about this all over the country,\" angell said. \"we've got a huge bank of volunteers doing phone-bank work everywhere, and we're on most campuses .\" the crucial thing for us is direct contact with the voters through the phones and outreach. we really do feel we can win this. \"about 1,000 volunteers from as far away as denver's women's marijuana movement have pitched in to spread the pro-pot message by phone to voters. the proposition, drawn up by medical marijuana pioneer <mark>richard lee</mark> of oakland, would allow local jurisdictions to legalize the possession of as much as an ounce of marijuana for recreational use by anybody 21 or older, and to tax pot sales. each person could also grow the drug for personal use in anything up to a 5-by-5-foot space .\" i've always said that cannabis prohibition is hypocritical and unfair, \"said <mark>lee</mark>, who founded the oaksterdam marijuana-trade school in oakland .\" this sort of law is overdue. \"\"confusion' on the flip side, anti-prop. 19 activists say people don't need to be convinced that a drug is a drug. it's getting them to the polls that matters most .\" prop. 19 isn't really what it says it is - it will lead to a great deal of confusion, and it won't stop crime, \"said pleasant hill police chief dunbar, spokesman for the california police chiefs association .\" marijuana may be legalized one day, but this is not the way to do it. \"salazar said his campaign's message boils down to this:\" prop. 19 claims to regulate, tax and control marijuana, but it in fact does none of those things. \"he said there would be a proliferation of people coming to work and driving while stoned, and that many sellers may refuse to pay local taxes because marijuana would still be illegal under federal law. several home-grown groups, such as citizens against legalizing marijuana, a self-started outfit of 15 in sacramento, are spreading thousands of leaflets around the state to counteract the pro-prop. 19 phone calls and campus crusades. neither side will say if it is planning last-minute tv or radio ads, but if they do the arguments would undoubtedly echo what has already made the proposition the most recognizable one on the ballot, carcieri said. those for prop. 19 argue that it would bring in billions to governmental coffers through taxes and fees and give people the freedom to use an herb they see as less harmful than liquor or tobacco. and those who oppose it say prop. 19 would legitimize a dangerous drug that the federal government would still outlaw .\" americans really do believe in personal liberty, and that's part of why this proposition has gotten this far, \"carcieri said .\" of course, this is too much for even a lot of those who believe in personal liberty - but this time there is also the money argument. \"without the desperate economic situation we have now, this wouldn't be on the ballot .\" for more election-related news and information, visit our game 6 nlcs:

boys soccer season wednesday night in libertyville. the vikings (17-3-2) were eliminated after suffering a 3-1 defeat to no. 7 highland park (14-5-4), which struck for 3 unanswered goals in a seven-minute span to extend a memorable postseason run for retiring head coach dave bene. advertisement highland park meets host and no. 1 seed libertyville for a sectional championship on saturday morning. \"i guess i have to continue pinching myself because of this team,\" said a humble bene, who will step aside following the season after 33 years at the helm. \"we appeared to be in trouble after a very good start by fremd, and later, when they scored so quickly after the break. but we had that stretch in the second half when we scored those three quick goals, one of them a highlight goal from eoin moore, which really got us going .\" the vikings began by putting the pressure on the giants, and spurred by the speed and pace of front-runners lorenzo savino, matt burkhardt and yusuke kanada, along with a strong wind at its back, the msl champs appeared to be just a touch or two away from getting into the back of the net during the first quarter-hour. \"we didn't manage the wind very well tonight, and we let it affect how we played and highland park didn't,\" said fremd coach steve keller. a long, well-struck free kick from alex bochat forced giants keeper <mark>aaron white</mark> into a save at 10 minutes. later, spencer filosa and savino worked a nice 1-2 combination to allow savino to get free in close, only to watch talented sweeper konrad kucharski track back and clear off the end line. \"that no. 2 (kucharski) is a load back there, and easily one of the most impressive players along the back that i've seen all year long,\" said keller. moments after the break, the vikings took lead, courtesy a well-played corner sent low on the floor by brian hindle from the near flag to filosa, who on the turn, fired a smash off of <mark>white</mark> and into the net. disaster struck for fremd seven minutes later when an innocent looking corner serve from noah bloch appeared to knuckle on fremd keeper scott sutarik and slip through the senior's gloves and into the 6-yard box, where kucharski slotted the equalizer. what happened two minutes later might have been the beginning of the end for the vikings. that's when eoin moore unleashed a blast from 30 yards that buried itself into the back of the net to give the giants the lead for good. \"that was an amazing goal from eoin, and one that a senior player like he came through to score for us,\" said bene. playing from behind for the first time in weeks, the vikings conceded a costly third goal when they failed to clear a loose ball. freshman francesco moore was only to happy to steer in a shot from 20 yards. \"i'll give our guys credit for not giving up when we went down 2 goals, but we were chasing a highland park team which was energized and feeling very good about things after that third goal,\" keller said. the vikings stepped up the tempo in search of cutting into the giants' lead, and nearly did so if not for a brilliant save by <mark>white</mark>, who in full stretch to his left somehow stopped a shot by hindle at point-blank range. the giants dropped numbers, while fremd added another striker up top. and although it was one-way traffic heading in the direction of <mark>white</mark> and company, the vikings were not able to score again. custom reprints are a powerful and strategic way to share your article with customers, employees and prospects. the ygs group provides digital

(remember, all the drama started about moving his show back 30 minutes, but it re-energized all of the players, benefiting the red-haired comedian the most .) conan walked away with fans' sympathy, his integrity and a boatload of cash. he's now had some time and the opportunity to do make something new, hopefully with the added assurance of knowing exactly who the audience is. from early reports, it sounds like conan will stickfairly close to the established late-night formula. we'll all be watching live for the first week at least. after that, i'll just wait to see what survives past first airing on my monitor the next morning. late night hosts are fighting for more than out hearts and minds; it's our clicks and browsers. here's a first to worst comparison of the late night hosts and their web hits and misses: to borrow a colbert-ism, speaking truthiness to power. here in canada, there's still ongoing grumblings about the geo-blocked comedy central u.s. site, but stewart is the guy who first drove most of us to see what we missed last night and remains the best. best moment: there are plenty, although we'll pick his stop on cnn's crossfire as his best viral moment. most recent: ystewart and colbert hosted a rally the washington mall this weekend and many desk warriors are playing catch-up with that now. also last week, the daily show posted an entire barack obama interview online, which was shortened for broadcast. strategy: nerds! after a rocky start, fallon has settled in and is doing a great showcasing technology on his program. he reads fan tweets and just gets it. a perfect example: the most popular youtube video right now is a gears of war 3 trailer from six months ago that he premiered on the show. best and most recent: while reuniting the saved by the bell cast wasn't bad last year, his recent history of rap with justin timberlake was awesome and another sign of his savvy approach. the show cleared the musical rights for all the songs used in it, so it could be posted online after the show. conan o'brien strategy: all aboard the team coco express. o'brien galvanized his web fans when his tonight show was cancelled. now the question is whether he can take him with him to cable. best: he obviously gets it, as many of his most-viewed clips show, but we still like his closing remarks on cynicism from his last show. most recent: his tbs promos are pretty funny, especially the desk washing one set to def leppard's \"pour some sugar on me .\" <mark>jimmy kimmel</mark> strategy: with a little help from my famous friends. <mark>kimmel</mark> knows how to grab the web's attention, as he has in the past with great star-studded bits like the dueling f------ben affleck-matt damon songs. he also knows the power of justin bieber, as his most-viewed youtube clip has the bieb meeting a fan, with more than 16 million views. best: the songs were good, but post the academy awards handsome men's club ruled. most recent: it feels like it's been a while since <mark>kimmel</mark> found his way into our inboxes. we wonder if he's waiting until o'brien returns and needs to pull out the stops again. letterman is old school, and couldn't seem to care less, like the pointed way he says \"www\" when talking about websites. that said, he's had plenty of viral-worthy moments coming out of his show. best: joaquin phoenix's bearded fake-out. most recent: phoenix's come clean after the release of casey affleck's film i'm still here, which obviously was nowhere near as good as the first. punch me in the chin. leno's got to feel weird knowing that his tonight show actions helped benefit his competitors on the air and online. a perfect example is <mark>kimmel</mark>'s host - skewering appearance as part of his ten at 10 segment on his old show. it's one of the top hits when leno's name is searched on youtube. best: there's not much, how about jim carrey as jay leno from careers @ the star advertise with us", "articleID": "2010110117_00019424_W", "names": {"Jimmy Kimmel": ["Q20793563", "Q4914"]}}]
