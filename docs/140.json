first-half display in the 3-2 victory over malaga in the copa del rey. <mark>sergio sanchez</mark> and martin demichelis gave malaga a surprising two-goal lead at the break, before madrid turned the score around in the second half, with three goals in 10 minutes, to take an important step towards reaching the quarter-finals of the competition. after the match, mourinho noted that it was crucial to change some things at the break and admitted it was not easy to decide which players he had to replace. \"i told my players at half-time that if i could make 11 substitutions, i would change the entire team,\" he told reporters at a pist-match press conference. \"i could only make three, but i would have changed all 11 players. i changed three players so that the team could do different things, i thought about doing it before the break, but that is not something that i like. sochaux president alexandre lacombe: marvin martin will not leave in january santos close down futsal and

las vegas - with the defection of former strikeforce champs alistair overeem, nick diaz and <mark>dan henderson</mark>, the ufc's sister promotion finds itself a little short in the titleholder department. strikeforce ceo scott coker today said he hopes to rectify that by mid-2012. however, perhaps as part of the \"business as usual\" mantra of the promotion, coker declined to speculate on whether or not a few key names could be expected to figure into the picture. \"i think by mid-year, we'll have all titles pretty much filled in strikeforce's vacant divisions,\" coker said at thursday's \"strikeforce: rockhold vs. jardine\" pre-event press conference. one of those key welterweight matchups takes place at saturday's showtime-broadcast event in las vegas, as the undefeated tyron woodley (9-0 mma, 7-0 sf) meets canadian youngster jordan mein (23-7 mma, 1-0 sf). woodley has taken to calling himself the uncrowned champion at 170 pounds, and you won't find too many mma pundits willing to argue. while coker admitted woodley would seem a logical choice should he down mein, there was also no \"win and you're in\" guarantee. instead, the strikeforce boss pointed to matchmaker sean shelby for guidance on who would contend for the belt vacated by diaz. \"we're definitely going to keep our eyes on the fight,\" coker said. \"i mean,\" t-wood' has definitely proven himself. \"i know that in the next couple fights that we have, we're going to have some top welterweights fighting, but that's something that we're going to sit down with sean after this event and plan something out, just like we're going to plan out the light heavyweight division and get our champion in that division .\" one strikeforce division that does boast a champion is 185-pounds, and titleholder luke rockhold defends his belt against longtime veteran keith jardine in saturday's main event. jardine took a slot that was originally intended for 32-year-old <mark>tim kennedy</mark> (12-3 mma, 5-1 sf), who has dropped just one of his six career strikeforce outings. <mark>kennedy</mark> was forced to withdraw from the planned matchup with an undisclosed training injury, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's waiting in the wings to challenge the winner, according to coker. mmajunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com). \"after this fight, let's see how the fights go, and then we can reevaluate from there and then get back to you on the next fight .\" in 2011, strikeforce officials declared the pearl at the palms casino resort in las vegas the permanent home of the promotion's \"challengers series\" events. however, when strikeforce and showtime partnered for another year of events on the premium-cable channel, the prospects-driven series was immediately scrapped. strikeforce is kicking off its 2012 schedule in sin city, but the company moved crosstown to the joint at hard rock hotel & casino. coker declined to speculate on the likelihood of a 2012 return to either venue but did say that the company would not be tied down to las vegas. \"it's nice to be in vegas,\" coker told mmajunkie.com. \"this is the home of zuffa and the headquarters of the family. there are tremendous resources here. but this was an event where we felt the free preview weekend would be a great opportunity to have a showcase for our talent, and we made a decision to pull this fight off in a relatively quick manner .\" we felt this was a great opportunity, and luckily the hard rock opened up their doors, and here we are. we're looking forward to putting on more events here in las vegas, but we're also going to go on the road. we're going to be a traveling show and going all over the country. \"the company is next expected to touch down in columbus, ohio, for a march 3
