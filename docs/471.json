Wiliams, who failed to clinch her seventh US Open title and 24th Grand Slam, directly accused the chair umpire, Portuguese <mark>Carlos Ramos</mark>, of sexism during a post-match press conference Saturday, reports Efe news. <mark>Ramos</mark> called out three violations against Williams in the second set: the first being a warning about receiving coaching, the second a penalty point for racket destruction and the third another penalty for verbal abuse for calling him a \"thief .\" \"He took a point from me.

Picture by <mark>Prem Singh</mark> New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed petitions from Congress politicians Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes that had challenged the reopening of their tax assessments for 2011-12. The bench of Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and A.K. Chawla said: \"The writ petitions have failed .\" On August 16, the high court had reserved its order after the income-tax department contended that Rahul's tax assessment for 2011-12 had been reopened on the ground of the concealment of material facts. The bench had orally asked the income-tax department not to take any coercive step against Sonia, Rahul or Fernandes till it had pronounced its verdict. Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, appearing for Sonia, had said he had faith in the oral statement made by additional solicitor-general Tushar Mehta. Mehta had argued that the Congress politicians had alleged mala fide on the part of the income-tax department but had not made any averments on this. Rahul Gandhi offers water from Kailash Mansarovar at Rajghat on Monday. Picture by <mark>Prem Singh</mark> The income-tax cases against the Congress politicians had arisen from a probe into a private criminal complaint lodged by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy with a trial court in connection with the National Herald newspaper case. Swamy has accused Sonia, Rahul and others of conspiring to misappropriate funds by floating a company called Young Indian that paid only Rs 50 lakh for the right to recover assets worth Rs 90.25 crore that Associated Journals Ltd, the publisher, owed the Congress. The income-tax department has said the shares Rahul has in Young Indian would lead him to have an income of Rs 154 crore and not around Rs 68 lakh, as was assessed earlier. It has already issued a demand notice for Rs 249.15 crore to Young Indian for the assessment year 2011-12. The department's move followed its probe into a complaint alleging the Gandhis had misappropriated Associated Journals' assets while transferring their shares to the newly formed Young Indian.

Hungary has selected Academy Award winning director <mark>Laszlo Nemes</mark>' sophomore feature Sunset as its submission in the best foreign-language film for the Oscars. In 2016 <mark>Nemes</mark> won an Oscar for his feature debut, Son of Saul - a stunning portrayal of a Jewish man's desperate attempt to give a dead boy he believes is his son a proper burial in the midst of the brutality of Nazi concentration camp. His new film, which premiered in competition at the Venice film festival last week, is set some 30 years before Son of Saul at another major historical juncture in the lives of Hungarians: the eve of the First World War .\" Sunset is about a civilisation at its crossroads, \"<mark>Nemes</mark> said in a statement issued Tuesday by the Hungarian National Film Fund .\" In the heart of Europe at the height of progress and technology, without being written in history, the personal story of a young woman becomes the reflection of the birth of the 20th century. \"Starring Juli Jakab as Irisz, a young woman who comes to live and work in Budapest in 1913 on a mission to find a brother she had never known of, the film dives into a world of violence and intrigue. With visual references to Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1957 anti-war film Paths of Glory and a nod to the masked sex party scene from his 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut, the film runs to nearly two and half hours in length. The Hollywood Reporter critic Deborah noted:\" The [film's] heavy symbolism and penchant for creating unresolved mysteries drives it far from the poignancy of Son of Saul. \"Produced by Laokoon Filmgroup, (Hungary) and Playtime (France) with the support of the Hungarian National Film Fund, Sunset was made on a budget of $10.4 million. Sony Pictures Classics has picked up the film for North America and Australia. World sales are being handled by Playtime. Hungary has a long history of submitting films to the Oscars, starting in 1965 with Zoltan Fabri's Twenty Hours. Nominated ten times (including last year for Ildiko Enyedi's On Body and Soul), it has won the coveted golden statuette twice - in 1981 for <mark>Istvan Szabo</mark>'s Mephist o and in 2016 for Son of Saul.

It doesn't mean that I let the children playing alone during I share gossips with my coleagues, absolutely not. We call free playing also \"free activity\" which shows more the \"active\" side of it. What is it about? Concretely, you can set up a room with some toys, all reachable easily by the kids, and let them act as they want (as part as the house's rules, thought by the team!). And that's it? Actually not. To go further, I'll quote Anna Tardos (psychologist) describe it more in her article Une vie active (\"An active life\" , from Association Pikler-L\u00f3czy de France, n \u00b0 43, not translated in English). For her, there are some factors which help the child to have a better quality of playing: A physical and psychological wellness A long enough duration of playtime, and a regularity for it A big enough place to play, where the child can feel secure Some things to play which stimulate his activity The behaviour from the adults: being patient and letting the time for the children to act with independence With these elements, the child can use his energy to learn a lot of new capacities. Why is it interesting for children? Because it is part of their life! They actually learn so much without any free from adults' instructions. Playing is serious. \"We cannot suppose at first, how much he [a child] can learn while he handles something. He is not only learning to know himself, with his hands and feet, he is not only learning to use, to position his hands, to take things and to become more skilled, but he exercices also his attention, to stay focused and to discover what is around him. He learns that difficulties can be overcome and that one can conquer them by persistence. His success gives him the pleasure of discovering. He is learning how to learn. Most of us think that\" playing \"is something frivolous, only to get a child rid of boredom and so a waste of time. However, a child's first activity is to play: the baby is playing putting something in his mouth, touching, observing and manipulating the objects around him...but in the same time he is learning about the different textures, the colours, the tastes, to compare the sizes and the shapes...his curiosity will lead him to learn and master new concepts and movements. If we go further, he learns also some universal laws (like the gravity, probability, ...) and he learns function of his needs and interests, that makes it more efficient. So, during the firsts months, we can mostly observe manipulations games, and then, when the child is a bit more intellectually mature,\" Pickaboo \"games linked with the situations of separations he lives. Later, we will see more role-playing games, to play daily life scenes or other special moments thats chocked him, to be able to appropriate them and make them easier to tolerate. But this is not a rule, I summarize a lot! Free-playing, an activity that support children'S developpment Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash As I explained before, to play is connected with the child's development. Actually a child who can play freely will: Developp his motricity in his way and feel confident and strong Discover the world Start to learn school skills Developp his creativity and imaginaition Improve his social skills Developp a strong self-esteem, which looks at his own difficulties without dip into his self confidence...And so much more! I think it's important to instist on the ability of children to do it alone, I mean, an adult doesn't need to inerfere directly and to show how to do. That leads children to be more self-confident and to know themselves better, and also to feel comfortable in a group and with his interactions with others. Doing alone, a child feels that he is able to try new things and doesn't have a fear of failure...which becomes the opportunity to try again and learn. What are the adults suppose to do then? Their role is so important! He stays further back but must be watchful: he has to observe carefully children, and that is the basis of his role. He must act only if necessary and mostly to comment an action, to put a feeling in words, to explain a situation to a child who doesn't understand He will act physically only in case of danger for a child. The adult will show interest for a child's activity looking at him, giving sense to it with some words. His observations will be very useful too: it helps to know each child better, and so to better know his needs and understand more why is he acting in a certain way. Then the adult can offer other toys and objects that respond better to children's need in the group, reorganize the playing room. He is not passive at all because he will lead children with the choice of toys he gives, and his way of speaking with them, asking sometimes well-choose questions...Which kind of toys for a free-playtime? Absolutely everything if it fits with children's needs and capacities! For my, less oriented is a toy to a type of game, better it is. I would say also that all toys that put children in a passive state (like babies' computers, tablets, smartphones or every noisy -\" pedagogic \"- things). With an\" open \"toy, which gives a plenty of possibilities to play with, a child can imagine an infinity of games, developp his creativity, and make new discoveries with only one object. For example, these toys with rings in different size that we can put in the size's order on a stick: it's obviously possible to rank them from the smaller to the bigger, a child can also manipulate and discover what is the particularity of this shape, to make it roll, or turn on itself, to mix it with other toys to do something new...Another example: these cubes that can be integrated one into another, like Russian dolls. It is possible to make a tower with it, to rank them, discover their shape, to hide other things insid and to learn about their capacity by fulling them...But so many other toys are insterstings: small cars, dolls, doll's tea...most of everything as long as we let children playing by themselves. Adults doesn't have to intervene and say\" You should do it like this...\"or\" No like this it doesn't work! Look, I show you. \"or everything that could influence a child's game. Antje Bostelmann and <mark>Michael Fink</mark> describe 10 types of spontaneous games that we can observe with children (until 3 years old) playing freely) in the book Elementare-spielhandlungen von Kinder under 3: Erkennen, Begleiten, F\u00f6rdern (not translated in English). They distinguish: Photo by Alexander Dummer on Unsplash The things to hide To investigate how things fall down To investigate the sound of the things To reach behind the surfaces To move things To connect things To rank things To change and alternate the perspectives To mark and create new places To experiment the balance This is only an example of categorization but I find it useful to start to observe children playing. But as each individual is different and that so many elements of context can influence a situation, I think that it is restrictive to only be based on a list with types of games. But let's notice the use of the word\" Thing \"(\"Ding\" in German) instead of \"Toy\" (\"Spielzeug). That's underline that a child uses first objects, not toys to play...So actually, almost everithing can be used! So, be creative! Do you ever see a child who just received a present, playing with the gift wrap, and forgot the new toy? To go further...If you are curious, please, take a look to that we call\" alternative pedagogies \", particulary Emmi Pikler. Her pedagogy is actually based on the free-play and free-motion, mostly in direction of children under 3 years old. The association exists in different countries and offers trainings in diverse topics about the young child. In the UK: http: //www.pikler.co.uk/ In the USA: https: //pikler.org/ The Hungarian Website (but offers the books and trainings in many other languages, like German en Spanish): https: //www.pikler.hu/ About how to speak to children, as a French, I can advice you the Fran\u00e7oise Dolto's books like The Cause of Children, Underlying Stages of Childhood, and Everything is Language. But in the same topic, you can also find interesting books from the Pikler Institute. And for the German speakers, I will recommend you the book I mentioned before: Elementare-spielhandlungen von Kinder under 3: Erkennen, Begleiten, F\u00f6rdern from Antje Bostelmann andMichael Kink, which is a good tool to begin with children's observation.

Their questions began a conversation between Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kyle Petty and Nate Ryan about how NASCAR could alter their summertime calendar to consolidate the schedule without lessening the number of races run. The panelists were uniform in their desire to see most tracks host only one NASCAR Cup race per year. \"I hate to say this Jason, but...I wouldn't want any of the tracks to get a second date,\" Nate Ryan said. \"I don't really want to run anywhere twice,\" Dale Earnhardt Jr. joined in. \"I like Daytona a couple of times, but I'd like to see everyone go to one...and let's consolidate and make it special,\" Petty said. Taking away the second dates would create opportunities for new tracks to join the senior series--opening up new markets in the process. But there is also an opportunity to make the schedule more compact. The answer for Earnhardt, Petty and Ryan is mid-week races. \"We don't have to shorten the amount of races; let's shorten the time of the season,\" Earnhardt said. \"Run on some Wednesdays. Do even some doubleheaders and stuff like that ....But I think they should go to all the racetracks once and then add Iowa, Nashville Fairgrounds--places like that .\" \"Brad Keselowski has talked about this,\" Ryan said. \"That dead of summer period, June, July when NASCAR could really own some Wednesdays .\" For more, watch the video above.

In April it was announced that Matt Kenseth would replace Bayne behind the wheel of the No. 6 for select races in 2018. Kenseth's first race was at Kansas on May 12. Since then, Bayne has piloted the car six times with a best finish of 11th at Bristol. He is scheduled to run this week at Las Vegas. \"We're...in negotiations with drivers right now that would drive the 6 car next year,\" Roush told Claire B Lang. \"I think the decision has been made--and I don't want to be breaking the story here, but...it's been announced that Trevor's not going to be in the car next year .\" Roush did not provide further details about the driver search, saying: \"Who it is we're talking to and how close we are in those negotiations, I'm not...inclined to say, based on the fact that we are negotiating .\" While he would not reveal who is being evaluated for the ride, he has a type of driver in mind. \"I want a driver that can be fast,\" Roush said.

Jamie McMurray and William Byron knew their only hope to make the playoffs was in winning one of the biggest races of the NASCAR season, but they were not the only drivers crushed when Brad Keselowski pulled into victory lane instead. Here are some of this week's highlights: \"All right driver. You know what we got to do today. Make it happen .\" --<mark>Matt McCall</mark>, Jamie McMurray's crew chief \"Boys remember, a win gets us in,\" Darian Grubb, William Byron's crew chief \"It was really fast man; sorry about the brakes .\" Cole Pearn, Martin Truex Jr.'s crew chief \"I let him go every time he's been even close to me all year. Lead lap or not. If he don't want to do the same, then the next time racing, good luck getting around me .\" --Matt Kenseth on Joey Logano. \"The 6 wasn't too appreciative of the blocking .\" --Logano's spotter \"Yeah, well I'm not too appreciative of a lot of things from that guy--so: so what .\" --Logano \"He just frickin' dive-bombed the hell out of me .\" --Landon Cassill after contact with Jeffrey Earnhardt \"Cautions didn't fall our way. Make sure to keep your heads up; no dejection here .\" --<mark>Mike Wheeler</mark>, Denny Hamlin's crew chief after they lost the race. \"Not have meaningless guys in the back wreck. I mean, I don't know what they're doing crashing with a couple of laps to go--multiple laps down .\" --Hamlin For more, watch the video above.", "articleID": "2018091312_00338371_W", "names": {"Erik Jones": ["Q16239574", "Q57422872"], "Joe Gibbs": ["Q1254455", "Q22959236", "Q2331580", "Q25713948"]}}]
