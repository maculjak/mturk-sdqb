As the fallout from this shooting continues, both Gomez and Colwell agree that it was imperative that Buttigieg be seen in the city trying to calm tensions, instead of campaigning .\" The optics would have been pretty bad had he decided to keep on campaigning and just manage this over the phone. In that kind of situation, I think it was very important that he was in South Bend and back at home to manage this from the ground, \"said Gomez.

The ninth ranked Indians are unbeaten so far in the tournament, having registered comfortable wins over Uruguay (4-1), Poland (5-0) and Fiji (11-0). And going by their world rankings and current form, India are expected to win hands down against world No 16 Chile. India are just one win away from securing their place in the final round of Tokyo Olympic qualifiers to be held later this year with two top spots up for grabs from here. And achieving that goal shouldn't be much of a problem for the Indians. In all their pool matches, India plenty of scoring opportunities but conversion rate is an area which is of a little concern for chief coach Sjoerd Marijne. \"We want to perform at the highest level possible and I believe there is still room for improvement,\" Marijne had said. \"Our conversion rate can definitely be higher and if that happens it will be easier for us to win matches .\" Chile, on the hand, finished second in their pool and had to go through the cross-overs to seal their place in the last-four round. Chile defeated Mexico 7-0, hosts Japan 3-1 before being stunned by world No25 Russia 2-5. But in the cross-overs, Chile edged past Uruguay 5-2 to set up a last-four encounter against India. In the other semifinal, Russia will take on world No 14 Japan.
