<mark>roberto mancini</mark> believes that carlos tevez will remain at the club for' a long time' enlarge <mark>roberto mancini</mark> may have to do without carlos tevez this weekend, but the manchester city manager believes the argentine will be at eastlands for the long term, despite the pair's very public disagreement last saturday after tevez was substituted late on against bolton. \"i think we can talk about this situation every week,\" said <mark>mancini</mark> yesterday. \"now we must have a focus on the games. we have a difficult month and big games ahead. we can't speak about him [tevez] every week. we can cope without him. he has spoken this week, but i've explained about 1,000 times now. i think he will stay here for a long time as he's never spoken to me about anything else with this situation .\" tevez's touchline dissent came not long after collecting his fifth yellow card of the season. that means the striker will be missing against bottom-placed west ham tomorrow; and that doesn't bode well for city as the club's over-reliance on tevez this season has almost become crippling. the statistics simply don't make easy viewing, with <mark>mancini</mark>'s side winning just once since january when tevez has failed to find his way on to the scoresheet. according to <mark>mancini</mark> that is about to change given the rich talent in the expensive squad that has been assembled at eastlands. \"i think that this is a time when we can try to win without carlos,\" said <mark>mancini</mark>. \"he is an important player for us. but the players that will play will have a good game. i'm sure of that. if we continue to play like we did against bolton and against stoke in the second half we can win without him .\" but we know we must try to score with the other players. there's enough quality there with mario [balotelli], jo, and [adam] johnson. we can do this. carlos is an important player inside the box as he's very dangerous. he is a fantastic player. he is one of the most important players in europe, in the world maybe. for us he is very important. but if we play like we did against bolton, we can still win without him. \"in a week when tevez has quashed speculation that he wants to quit the club, the dependency on the former manchester united striker this season has been eased somewhat in recent weeks thanks to the introduction of balotelli. but tevez remains the vital cog in <mark>mancini</mark>'s wheel. with the italian's faith in the likes of emmanuel adebayor and jo remaining somewhat limited, tevez can perhaps do with a week off before the hectic christmas backlog of games fast approaching. yet given the number of talented players in <mark>mancini</mark>'s squad, the defensive, safety-first approach may have to be put on the back burner if manchester city are to go joint top of the premier league tomorrow afternoon. hodgson hints at new deal for lucas after brazilian finally proves his worth manager ready to

eternal nonsense my debate with a solipsist/taoist/advaitin by enleuk november 15, 2010 at 10:20 am i believe in the experience of being, that which is beyond words. this also means i don't believe it is god or metaphysical or anything i can name. it just is. i see the network of my brain and realize all my knowledge is relative because the network is a part of the universe and so i can only judge truth as subjective and relative (except the absolute truth which is beyond all concepts). and through relativity (logical deductions) i see there is no immaterial free will, there is only one life, i am my body and nothing else. this makes me happy; i am a body, i may not know what that ultimate means, but november 18, 2010 at 7:42 am i have had that experience, but i don't call it god because that sounds like it's not a metaphor for something else, but a real factual personal god. god implies a judeo-christian god, a god as defined by the people of the levant. that is not what i experienced. i experienced the unnameable, the mystery, that which has been metaphorized as the tunder of t.s. eliot's the waste land, the unity behind the duality of yin/yang, the necessary connection of all things related as portrayed in the black dot in the white field and the white dot in the black field, the emptiness, sunyata, of nagarjuna, the love of jesus or the father he describes by saying \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven; for he makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust\" , that which is beyond being and not being, beyond neither being nor not being, the transcendence of leela, the sun god ra, nirvana, brahman. <mark>joseph campbell</mark> said: \"you have to break past your image of god to get through to the connoted illumination. the psychologist jung has a relevant saying:\" religion is a defense against the experience of god .' the mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. an intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience. \"beyond kantian concepts, beyond nietzschean relativity, beyond all derridian traces, that's where the experience is, at the bottom of apsu. i am a materialist because i see the coherency of logically deduced material theories, and i will not misrepresent the mystery with personal interpretations of it, for your thoughts are subjective and so all your interpretations are flawed. maybe you believe in an ineffable mystery, but i don't think you'd call it god if you did. and if you believe in a judeo-christian god, then you're basing your conceptual interpretations of that mystery on a literal history of philosophy and must defend your concept against other philosophers and historians, and in the case of the judeo-christian god the battle was over long ago, as nietzsche says:\" could it be possible! this old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that god is dead! \"you say that my subjective experience doesn't invalidate your subjective experience, which would have been true, but you're not talking about a pure experience. my ineffable experience is not up against your conceptual interpretation of your experience, but you cling to a conceptual interpretation november 18, 2010 at 4:28 pm i understand your idea of not want to give it a name, however in your discourse you use many times conceptual names to describe your experience, names that are derived of particular cosmologies, like leela, the sun god ra, nirvana, brahman, etc. with their correspondent particular religions, and their particular historical, socio-cultural negative baggage. some religions in the past have tried to refer to it as the great mystery, the not named, because they were aware that one word do not encompass the divine, and it is true the word god bring in many of us preconceived ideas with negative connotations, and that is unavoidable. however billions of people they give it a name; allah, brahman, jehovah, etc. and that is fine with me also. shaykh muhyiddin ibn\" arabi is concerned with believers becoming limited to what they have found to be true from the real. he reminds us that god - allah - as he really is, is not the same as the god that people may imagine to be, although allah is not absent from this specific form either allah is unlimited, but the believer's imagination, or opinion of god - allah - is naturally limited. november 25, 2010 at 10:34 am first you tell me about your experience using religious, and metaphysical analogies, now you tell me you are a materialist that doesn't believe but the objective universe out there because our brain is part of it. you being a materialist that is easy to understand. but what was all that about: \"my ineffable experience\" how can you have an ineffable experience, if you say in your latest comment and again i quote you: \"there's no reason to believe anything about it\" please tell me more about that ineffable experience, that now seems more like a product of hocus-pocus. .? november 28, 2010 at 6:10 am i use metaphors because that's all we have. i say \"there is no reason to believe anything about it\" because it is ineffable, not just linguistically; it is unthinkable and therefore a moot point, it is the very definition of nonsense to believe in something you cannot imagine. \"truth can be likened to the bright moon in the sky. words, in this case, can be likened to a finger. the finger can point to the moon's location .\" no, words cannot point at it, because all words are metaphors and ultimately flawed. our understanding of the moon must be internally coherent (logical deduction) and anything we can't epistemologically think about must be disregarded. god can be epistemologically thought of, but is either incoherent or an absolute other, which, as i just said, is per definition nonsense. solipsism is not the only belief that requires a leap of faith into a completely unknowable ontology. brahman-atman, leela and pantheism are identical to solipsism in this respect. november 28, 2010 at 8:09 pm i respect your point of not wanting to give it a name, but splitting hairs about semantics for those that do, and consider that by giving it a name you limit it, that is totally your subjective view, and i accept that as well, but by no means believe that to be superior to those that give it a name. we all have a different qualitative understanding for the same word, that may trigger different responses. as a self confessed materialist, and atheist you are inescapable defined by those terms, that by the nature of semantics are limited as well, and subject to misinterpretations. if you have an ineffable experience, you admit to the ineffable, and that is the moon. november 30, 2010 at 5:54 pm no, i'm only negating the finger-pointing, not the moon itself. i'm negating the attributes you put on the unattributable. and if you think your subjective opinion can do battle with mine and not lose, then please, explain why deduction is not the most useful method of describing the universe. december 1, 2010 at 3:37 pm i am sorry i forgot metaphysics it is not associated to a mystical experience from your materialistic point of view, what i mean in lack of a materialistic, and atheist definition to describe the process of enlightenment, in what context, medium, vehicle, practice, or whatever you want to name it, you have the experience? december 2, 2010 at 4:49 pm so, you mean to tell me one day you woke up and decided you were enlightened? with no practice, no context, and no vision, except for your materialist and atheistic philosophy, and the books you read? that is for sure a new one. alas, if cows could fly! look henrik you seem like a nice guy, but somehow confused, you want to have it both ways, to have your cake, and eat it too, and that is not possible. i got no idea how old are you, but sometimes you sound like a young person, i had been to your blog and there is potentiality in you for real spiritual progress, you may look like a buddha, speak like a buddha, but if you do not act like a buddha, you are not a buddha! and i do not mean disrespect, but you are like a parrot repeating with no real wisdom, all talk, no praxis! there is knowledge in books, wisdom is for you to add, knowledge without realization, is of little use. some years ago i wrote a letter to a friend, and decided to post it a few months ago, you can find it at my blog under the title: letter to a friend about montaigne, writing, and other matters. that apply to you like a charm! read it, is short, you may benefit, your ego is a little out of hand, you are here to win arguments, and feed your ego, you are not fooling anybody, but yourself. and there cannot be any progress in the spiritual path if you do not start to tame the ego, and for that you need a real spiritual discipline, under a competent master, and many years of hard work, so be diligent. by the way anything you want to find about me, all you got to do is read my blog. it is short, only have sixteen posts so far. i am here to serve people in the path, if you need confidential advice, just let me know, get in contact with me, you are welcome. december 3, 2010 at 7:16 pm \"i got no idea how old are you, but sometimes you sound like a young person\". i am 27. \"so, you mean to tell me one day you woke up and decided you were enlightened?\" i've never called myself enlightened. i didn't wake up one day knowing everything after having known nothing the day before. \"your ego is a little out of hand, you are here to win arguments, and feed your ego, you are not fooling anybody, but yourself .\" i didn't come here to win an argument, i came here to challenge your words, so that i might learn something, so that i might challenge my beliefs. \"if you do not act like a buddha, you are not a buddha\" i've never claimed to either be, have been, gonna be or want to be a buddha. you also say \"you seem like a nice guy, but somehow confused\" and \"you are like a parrot repeating with no real wisdom\". it's not often i get so many presumptuous and condescending personal attacks all in one comment. i've read all your posts. in the montaigne letter post you talk about western heartless egos, and i assume that's what you're referring to when you say \"that applies to you like a charm\". is this your prejudice or do you have quotes from my blog to support all of these accusations? \"i experienced the unnameable, the mystery, that which has been metaphorized as the tunder of t.s. eliot's the waste land, the unity behind the duality of yin/yang, the necessary connection of all things related as portrayed in the black dot in the white field and the white dot in the black field, the emptiness, sunyata, of nagarjuna, the love of jesus or the father he describes by saying\" love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven; for he makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust \", that which is beyond being and not being, beyond neither being nor not being, the transcendence of leela, the sun god ra, nirvana, brahman .\" are those not your words? i warned you of borrowing terms for your experience with religious and well known metaphysical, connotations. now those are big claims for a person who confess not even a practice of those beliefs, but furthermore that also deny their possibility as valid. again i quote you: \"tao/sunyata is a linguistically relative metaphor for the absolute truth, and it is ineffable/empty because the objective reality is unobtainable by subjects .\" therefore you can't have your cake and eat it too. those last words unobtainable by subjects, what do you think they mean, or imply? henrik, it is not my purpose to offend you, but to make you aware that it is not the same reading a book let's say about kara-te, and believe you are already a black belt without ever practiced the art! sorry, if it hurt your feelings, but if you think i have being tough, wait until you start a real practice! and you are right i wish this would challenge your beliefs, otherwise all our conversation is useless. december 5, 2010 at 7:50 am \"so if you believe that to be impossible, is not true, that you ever experience the ineffable, right?\" december 5, 2010 at 7:59 pm yes, subjectively! and according to your materialistic and nihilistic beliefs totally meaningless, and therefore useless! but i do not care about it if you believe you are clark kent. i am not claiming that, i am claiming that is not possible to use analogies or metaphors using well know religious origins dismissing their cultural, doctrinaire, dogmatic, historical, cosmological view of those experiences, that is cultural relativism. and no i do not have a prejudice against you, or western society in general but when you claim: \"i have had that experience, but i don't call it god because that sounds like it's not a metaphor for something else, but a real factual personal god. god implies a judeo-christian god, a god as defined by the people of the levant. that is not what i experienced. i experienced the unnameable, the mystery, that which has been metaphorized as the tunder of t.s. eliot's the waste land, the unity behind the duality of yin/yang, the necessary connection of all things related as portrayed in the black dot in the white field and the white dot in the black field, the emptiness, sunyata, of nagarjuna, the love of jesus or the father he describes by saying\" love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven; for he makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust \", that which is beyond being and not being, beyond neither being nor not being, the transcendence of leela, the sun god ra, nirvana, brahman .\" you are committing a grievous mistake of equaling your experience, to theirs and that is what i am talking about when i said in my post of letter to a friend about montaigne, writing, and other matters: \"which take to my posterior reflection, about the lack of sympathy i feel in regard for many members of the western intelligentsia who embrace buddhism, out of their idea that it conforms to our way of thinking, and therefore suits our intellectual proclivities,\" you cheery pick those metaphors to suit your materialistic philosophy, without respecting their true meaning based in their proper context. december 6, 2010 at 3:17 am it is true that i cherry-pick, in the sense that i dismiss all the nonsens of \"fire, earth, water and air\" and 7 chakras and so on. i'm only using the metaphors to explain that the psychology is no different in their experience than in mine. you are clearly not a materialist and can therefore not accept this, but that is your subjectivity, not mine. december 7, 2010 at 4:38 pm here we come full circle, you want to convince me of your subjective ideas based in your intellectual understanding of somebody else experience, and that is why you see them similar. we can't live by proxy, our experience is unique, and it will never can be exactly the same regardless, this is the ship of theseus paradox. the whole idea of a spiritual practice is to come to the realization of your own experience, using methods that have been tried in the past and are effective, regardless of your preconceived ideas about them, if you do not have a practice you will never go too far, granted it takes work, and a lot of effort, but for the skeptics, there are easier, but riskier ways; ayahuasca, iboga, etc. you dismiss too easily what you do not know, or doesn't sound like fit your cosmology, just to give you an example you said: \"it is true that i cherry-pick, in the sense that i dismiss all the nonsens of\" fire, earth, water and air \"and 7 chakras and so on. over billions of chinese people have used acupuncture for over two thousand years, even chairman mao, a staunch materialist and an atheist confronted with the need of medics, and medicines for his troops during the long march, come to the realization that acupuncture was good enough for his troops, and to this day the practice of acupuncture is alive and well not only in modern communist china but also in many other places including western nations. well, as you may guess acupuncture is based on taoist cosmology, that to our modern western understanding may seem unbelivable, in great part based in those same things you arrogantly dismiss as nonsense, here:\" the whole idea of a spiritual practice is to come to the realization of your own experience, using methods that have been tried in the past \"that's a contradiction:\" we can only use other people methods to have a unique experience \". it's interesting that you bring up acupuncture because acupuncture has been proven fake, it's pseudo-science, which means it's all placebo. i can't know their experience no, but then again, you can't know their experience either, you have to make a subjective judgment whether you believe your experience is somewhat like the experience of those who claim attributes like the word\" enlightenment \"based on your subjective understanding of their subjective experience and their subjective intellectual description to you about it. that means we're no different you and i when we evaluate our own and others' experiences and so you can't use that as a argument against me and not at the same time against yourself. you may think your heart cannot lie to you, but that's your subjective opinion, but even if it were you have to make a knowledge-based (even if it's\" knowledge of the heart \") decision whether the experienec other people describe to you and which you can only evaluate through their linguistic description of it, then it comes down to who is intellectually better informed about the experience. i am well aware of the effects of ayahuasca and many other drugs, like dmt, mdma, mushrooms, lsd, peyote, marijuana, cocaine, heroine, amphetamine, opium, alcohol, tobacco and so on. not that i have taken all of them, but it's only the intellectual description of them that matters since we can't feel what others feel. and regardless of our own experiences, under influence or not, we have to relate those experiences subjectively to the language we share and that's our only way of making this judgment. i was talking to a scientologist on his blog, it's in swedish but i can tell you about it. he said that billions or trillions of years ago, metaphysical enteties created the universe and eventually got entangled in it and forget who they used to be, obsessed with the material reality in which they started to believe was real. to free yourself and again become master of time and space, you have to pay a lot of money and go to meeting with an auditor, which is like a spiritual master or guide. the auditor has a device which measures electrical resistance of the skin, but claims that it measures spiritual resistance and is used to unblock the mind, free the spirit. at one point the scientologist i was talking to, during one of these therapy sessions, has an out-of-body experience. i said that oobs are common neurological phenomena, we know what happens in the brain to create these sensations and that it's an illusion of the brain and you're not actually a metaphysical soul that ventures outside the physical body, but he had had this experience and so had a lot of other scientologists and therefore scientology is true and ghosts exist and medium are for real and so on and so on. that's the problem with subjectivity. but even if it were you have to make a knowledge-based (even if it's\" knowledge of the heart \") decision whether the experienec other people describe to you and which you can only evaluate through their linguistic description of it, then it comes down to who is intellectually better informed about the experience. my response to you rather than judging and try to discriminate with your intellect about it, which since my first response to you i clearly told you: you could be perfectly content with yourself believing whatever you wish, but your subjective ideas don't invalidate somebody else experience, that it is not the process of subjective discourse, like i believe the universe work this way, or that other way, therefore it is impossible for god to exist, or oh, if you were under the influence of ayahuasca, it is perfectly reasonable to understand that the chemical process in your brain made you believe all this weird stuff! my answer to you is; you try it and experience it, then we argue if your experience was real, or it was just another idea that cross your mind! either you have experienced god, or you don't, but if you never have a mystical experience that open your heart, all your ideas it is just the chatter box you carry on your head that never stop talking! henrik is not about who is intellectually better informed about china or not, is about if you have ever been to china! you dismiss acupuncture as a fake, you arrogantly negate billions of chinese experience just because you read somewhere is a fake, rather than rely in someone else account you try it! go have a shot of ayahuasca! we have come full circle, here henrik, this is for you: once, a long time ago, there was a wise zen master. people from far and near would seek his counsel and ask for his wisdom. many would come and ask him to teach them, enlighten them in the way of zen. he seldom turned any away. one day an important man, a man used to command and obedience came to visit the master .\" i have come today to ask you to teach me about zen. open my mind to enlightenment. \"the tone of the important man's voice was one used to getting his own way. the zen master smiled and said that they should discuss the matter over a cup of tea. when the tea was served the master poured his visitor a cup. he poured and he poured and the tea rose to the rim and began to spill over the table and finally onto the robes of the wealthy man. finally the visitor shouted,\" enough. you are spilling the tea all over. can't you see the cup is full? \"december 8, 2010 at 5:56 pm the flaws of anecdotal evidence is exactly what i was pointing at with my reference to the perceived enlightenment of the scientologist. doesn't matter how many people claim that acupuncture works for them when all unbiased tests show that it's just placebo. and i have had that experience, why do you keep saying i will learn something after i have one when i've made it clear i've already had the experience. you don't think it can be achieved by a materialist or without drugs, but that's a problem of your limited, or perchance even deluded, mind, and not a problem of my limited, and perchance deluded, mind. also, i've invited you to my tea party (my blog), but you refuse my tea even before tasting it solely because it smells strange to you. i have been to your blog and read here, and there. and what you say about quantum physics from a materialist point of view is sound, i am not opposed to the study of matter by science, but ultimately what they have found it is what hindu cosmology have been telling us for quite a long time the universe is maya, illusion. the chinese: the tao that can be told is not the eternal tao the name that can be named is not the eternal name. the unnamable is the eternally real. naming is the origin of all particular things. free from desire, you realize the mystery. caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. this source is called darkness. darkness within darkness. the gateway to all understanding. the sufis also speak of creation not only in the past, but as a continuous process, this is what is called the renewal of creation at every instant. at every moment the universe is absorbed in to the principle and recreated at every moment, in fact existence is not a state, but an act, as the existenciating command of god,\" be \"the sufis tell us that the absolute see itself on creation like in a mirror, so no wonder if you study the image of the mirror you will only find a reflection that is not the real. most people problems with god arise of trying to find him, not realizing that in a mirror right is left, and left is right! in the spiritual world things are inverse, you do not go looking for god, you do not realize god. god realize himself in you! if you only allow it. here the chinese again:\" if you overesteem great men, people become powerless. if you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal. the master leads by emptying people's minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. he helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know. practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place. \"if you would realize that emptiness that you talk so much about, but seem not to understand, it is precisely what the mystic strive for. now, those same guys who give us all that nonsense of earth, water, air, fire and the seven chakras come with a brilliant fellow named patanjali who expose a method of union (yoga) the yoga sutras of patanjali tell us:\" before beginning any spiritual text it is customary to clear the mind of all distracting thoughts, to calm the breath and to purify the heart. 1.1 now, instruction in union. 1.2. union is restraining the thought-streams natural to the mind. 1.3. then the seer dwells in his own nature. 1.4. otherwise he is of the same form as the thought-streams. 1.5. the thought-streams are five-fold, painful and not painful. 1.6. right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep and memory. 1.7. right knowledge is inference, tradition and genuine cognition. 1.8. wrong knowledge is false, illusory, erroneous beliefs or notions. 1.9. fancy is following after word-knowledge empty of substance. 1.10. deep sleep is the modification of the mind which has for its substratum nothingness. 1.11. memory is not allowing mental impressions to escape. 1.12. these thought-streams are controlled by practice and non-attachment. 1.13. practice is the effort to secure steadiness. \"etc. pay attention in particular to 1.2 you have to stop the flow of thought, if you don't you will never achieve emptiness, in this life, even if emptiness is our true nature. december 9, 2010 at 3:17 am\" the sufis also speak of creation not only in the past, but as a continuous process, this is what is called the renewal of creation at every instant. \"if you had actually read my blog you'd see that i talk about that a lot, but very rarely of quantum mechanics. maya is the real world, the illusion is the subjective experience of maya. i can accept that god is the inverse of maya, but if so, then god is just another name for maya and it would be pointless to talk about god instead of maya. you talk a lot but you say nothing, just repeating lengthy quotes and not being able to see the whole picture. december 9, 2010 at 7:31 am you see henrik, the problem with label yourself with a ism, or a ist, like in materliasm, or atheist, or any other ism for that matter, is that it force you in to dogmas, here you affirm that it is not possible to stop the flow of thought just because under the tenets of your religion, oh, i am sorry, your materialism that is impossible. but let's see how somebody else not bound by your limitations can see things: the universe is absolutely huge, so huge that every possible combination of events that you can imagine inside your head really exists! to give you an example of how the universe is infinite we must look at how the universe branches to infinity on the small side. if i had an apple and made it? as large and did this over and over again. there would always be an apple whether its original size was divided down and down ex .5, .25, .125, .0625 and so on. the apple would never disappear because the universe will always accommodate it. we must eliminate human measurements from our head because we have labeled certain sizes terms that make mathematical sense in our mathematical calculations of the universe. what people have failed to realize is that the earth's circumference is not really 24,902 miles because that it all relative to our idea of size and our measurements. the earth could indeed be .0000024902 cm in the overall scheme of the universe and humans could be .0000000000001 mm at their real height where we have labeled ourselves as perhaps 6 feet tall. let us imagine a universe with endless possibilities, do not waste time with concepts of dimensions and alternative realities that have been theorized. simply focus on the term infinite and the concept that infinite is never ending, therefore everything that you can imagine exists. your mom and dad are being born somewhere zillions of miles away, you are a grandparent, the president of the united states, the emperor of the chinese dynasty. somewhere you can even fly if in that given situation and in that given world, physics enable it. perhaps gravity is far weaker on that earth 9,999,999,999 human measured miles from here in the universe. back to concept of the ocean and land, just because you cannot see these things does not mean they do not exist. just because you cannot see those other planets does not mean they do not exist. for example let us look at the moon, humans weigh far less due to gravity and can therefore bounce along while that is not a possibility on our planet due to gravity. under creative commons license: attribution you say:\" also, it is impossible to stop the flow of thought. when i meditate i am under the illusion that i am not thinking, in actuality i am just thinking of emptiness, i will never get rid of the activity even when i'm not aware of it, evidenced by dreams and the subconscious. the fourth letter of aum is this same illusion. \"\"my response to you is if the universe is an illusion, why can't you have any illusion you may desire? why you have to add: so are all the experiences of the heart. in reality you are created by the neural network. i know people have wanted to believe in metaphysics for a long time because the discrepancy between the subjective experience of being and the detailed description of the body creates an insurpassable abyss, a mystery, and this lack of understanding leads us to assume that thunder is a force of will, that trees are inhabited by djinns, that the sun is pulled by a god, that the material world is not an explanation, we have to invent the idea of\" there's gotta be something more \", literally\" meta - \". december 9, 2010 at 4:55 pm\" the earth could indeed be .0000024902 cm in the overall scheme of the universe and humans could be .0000000000001 mm at their real height \"yes, but the point about deduction, which i've mentioned several times already, is that the relationship is the same regardless of the definition. i actually thought you had some good arguments behind your strong convictions, but it seems you just thought:\" space and time is infinite and i have a soul, therefore? \", which is a deduction based on two very weak presuppositions, because a) space is not infinite and b) the soul does not exist. space is huge, but not infinite. if you divide an apple enough times you come down to an apple cell, if you divide that cell, is it still an apple? if you divide the cell down to a single hydrogen atom, is that still an apple? if you divide that atom, is it still an apple? when does the apple become a human if you eat the apple atoms? the soul does not exist. like all language, the soul is a metaphysical simplification of a complex process. just because it's difficult to understand the discrepancy between our\" experience \"and our experience of our experiencers (the body) (i.e. between the experience and the being) doesn't mean it's sound to say it's gotta be magic. also, even if the idea of infinite space was true, lets say that the billions of galaxies we today believe is what makes up the universe are actually just a quark in a larger existence and the reason we can't see other quarks (other collections of billions of galaxies) is because quarks are so far apart and don't have a noticeble effect on each other. thus, this quark might very well be a part of a giant apple or any other structure. now, even if this was true, why should we believe it? nothing in the power of the human can justify this belief. there's no thinkable reason to believe it, (your arguments are indeed very poor). no delusional\" emotional reason \"to believe it. no evidence either by measurement or inference can be produced. so even if it was the truth, it would be foolish to believe in it. i only use - isms to spark debate, my arguments are not based on - isms. if someone offers a more likely explanation of the universe that doesn't fit with the acceptable definition of e.g. materialism, i will either propose that our understanding of matter be changed or if that is not logically or consensually possible reject materialism .\" why can't you have any illusion you may desire? \"because we're not metaphysical. the illusion is caused by the structuralization of matter. december 10, 2010 at 12:17 am i confess that i choose this article to see if you would catch this one! actually i agree partially with you jamison fisher makes the crass mistake of equating the universe with god in a pantheistic fashion, forgetting that the universe is finite. as for when an apple stop being an apple at the level of the atom, it is not important, before it was an apple, it was an atom of something else, that you eat the apple will be just like the earth in about 5 billion years, the sun will have used up its hydrogen reserves and will expand to become a red giant, with a radius of about earth's orbital distance. the earth will most likely be swallowed up when this occurs, so the apple! but it is not the apple that should concern you, but the lack of ontological reality (maya) of the apple, the atom of the apple, the earth, the sun, and the universe itself! yes, i read your: an arbitrary theory of creation, but honestly find them, semantically contrived, painfully tortuous to follow, the nearest to the truth of the matter is when you resume and say:\" in actuality, nobody knows the nature of water. but we are finite and therefore need to/do believe that we know. \"december 10, 2010 at 6:07 pm yes, but the implications of our lack of knowledge is the interesting part. to say that we don't know is far from a resum?, it's merely the prologue. we can't just say\" i have no clue \"and be done with it, and even worse would be to say\" i have no clue, therefore metaphysics is real. \"subsequent conclusions come from the same question that descartes answered with\" cogito ergo sum \", namely: what can i know? my answer is that you can't know the absolute nature of anything. ultimately nothing exists. but we have dependent-arising, meaning relativity, and we can judge the relative (internal) coherence of a world-view. thus, in the end, we can't even speculate about the ultimate nature of things, we can only think of/have to accept the deduced description of the world. december 10, 2010 at 7:53 pm in the house build by the materials of illusion whose inhabitant is more deluded? when you say: we can't just say\" i have no clue \"and be done with it, and even worse would be to say\" i have no clue, therefore metaphysics is real. \"conclusion:\" metaphysics is real. \"you truly don't understand why this is impossible to say? i don't know if there's an apple in my hand, therefore there is a spider in my hand, necessarily and without doubt a spider. i don't have a clue whether it's an apple or not, whether it's something else or not, therefore it must be a spider!\" i don't know, therefore metaphysics is real \". the point about deduction is not only that we must reduce our knowledge to unprovable deduction, but that this is necessarily what we must build our knowledge on. we can accept that we have no ultimate knowledge of course and say\" i don't know if i exist, i don't know if you exist, i don't know if god exists, i don't know if if anything exists, i don't know if eating will keep me alive, i don't know if there is water in my body, i don't know if there's any point in drinking water, i don't know how babies are made, i don't know et cetera, \"which is perfectly fine, but it doesn't seem very usable. and we can't get rid of deduction even if we did arrive at that conclusion, because we arrive at that conclusion through deduction of our knowledge. we use deduction to evaluate the idea that\" we can't know anything \", we came to this conclusion through deducing our experiences of the world. the problem of deduction is that the premises are absolutely unknowable, but the strength of deduction is that we can evaluate the internal coherency of ideas. and this is the relationship we inescapably build our knowledge with, no matter what delusional concepts are invented to circumvent this realization. in a house of illusion, the people who understand the laws of the illusion will be able to navigate through it. if the laws of illusion are sometimes altered by anyone or anything, the people who understand that one or that thing will understand how the laws change and thus fare best. if the laws of the illusion are constant, then there either is no thing or one to alter them or the thing or one is itself part of the laws or the laws themselves and therefore a superfluous element in the understanding of the house, which then is the entirety of existence and includes thing like love and bliss and consciousness and everything, at least to the person who understands that the house houses it-all. i'm not trying to convince you to just make me happy, i also want to share my thoughts with you and i want to explore my own thoughts and i want to explore language and i want a bunch of other stuff besides becoming happy through your conversion, which is far from a top priority of mine. december 12, 2010 at 12:28 pm cervantes taught us there is madness that can be sublime, in india the babas, mad people to our western eyes, people just call them god intoxicated, not as mockery, but as a sign of respect, if you argue with a mad man who is the fool? as to who would fare best will always be subjective, and therefore relative. meanwhile you reduce existence at a long series of i don't knows, and look for enlightenment in the workings of matter, always changing and voluble and dependent to a new discoveries, new hypothesis, photons, a new particle, or distant quarks, and black holes, somewhere in outer space, and dream of building science fiction technology like connecting your brain to a giant machine, not an original idea, and in my subjective judgment not a good one either, and to explore the universe it in a future still not existent, the outer realms of it, that is your privilege, and if it brings you joy, even better, meanwhile we suffer today the backlash of lesser technology, product of that knowledge, and the irresponsibility of those who menace not only us, but every other creature on earth. i understand the materialist position of consciousness to be a byproduct of matter, but then there is wisdom in matter, which would mean a sort of consciousness, self awareness, a guiding principle, that current scientist deny and attribute to chance, the laws of physics, time etc. and if pressed at all, some begrudgingly concede to name it a mystery not unveiled yet. this estate of affairs in contemporary science reduce men to a common lower denominator, a throw of the dice of a nihilistic, and purposeless existence, this is contrary to my experience, of life existence as a precious, and meaningful. on your views this wouldn't mater, i guess, it just will be a chemical reaction in my brain. maybe the common man one day would be able to realize truth through science, i do not deny that possibility, but in any case still would be a subjective experience, in the individual, and very likely not different of mystical experience were the vehicle for it, is not the mind, or the facts out there, but the heart. but unlike you, others before, and in the present as myself, have chosen a different way, i am unconstrained either by an scholastic necessity to conform, or an academic prestige to keep, that free me to speak my mind openly, and without restrains, without the fear of burning up my reputation, like e.f. schumacher that gave her daughter the book that will be his testament in his deathbed\" a guide for the perplex \"no doubt to escape criticism. when religions talk about different levels of being, is anathema, or just nonsense, when theoretical physicists talk about different dimensions, and all sorts of things, with little compunction. advaita vedanta speaks of three levels of truth. the transcendental or the p? ram? rthika level in which brahman is the only reality and nothing else; the pragmatic or the vy? vah? rika level in which both jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and iswara are true; here, the material world is also true, and, the apparent or the pr? thibh? sika level in which material world reality is actually false, like illusion of a snake over a rope or a dream. the third school of vedanta philosophy is the school of advaita vedanta. in this, the only reality that exists is brahman. this does not mean that the world does not exist, but that it has a lower level of reality. in advaita vedanta philosophy, the world exists, but it exists with only ambiguous reality, and it exists with brahman at its root. hence the true reality of the world is brahman and the reality that we see around us is a false reality, an ambiguous reality. so the world is really brahman, that which is not brahman has only relative reality and is to be disregarded. brahman is the only truth, the world is an illusion, and there is ultimately no difference between brahman and individual self. if i am mad so be it, unlike a young atheist that exclaimed that he was so sure of his beliefs, that if he by any chance would experience a mystical experience, he would run and check himself in to a clinic for the mentally disabled, i have no reason to distrust my experience, there is no two. subjectivity this entry was posted on november 28, 2010 at 1:24 pm and is filed under like be the first to like this post.", "articleID": "2010121322_00211158_W", "names": {"Joseph Campbell":

leaders praised u.s. envoy richard holbrooke, who died monday following heart surgery in washington d.c. (omar sobhani/reuters) world leaders are praising u.s. envoy richard holbrook, who died in a washington, d.c., hospital following surgery for a tear in his aorta. holbrooke was remembered for engineering the end of the 1992-1995 bosnia war - europe's bloodiest conflict since the second world war - and for seeking to bring stability to war-torn afghanistan. canadian foreign affairs minister lawrence cannon was among those offering condolences on tuesday, calling holbrooke \"a trusted friend of canada\" and \"an inspiration to all of us .\" \"today marks the 15th anniversary of the signing of the dayton accords, the agreement that mr. holbrooke brokered to end the war in bosnia and open the door to stability, and democracy for the people of the western balkans,\" cannon said in a statement. \"we valued his views and counsel on the many issues that brought canada and united states together to promote our common values in a world fraught with conflict and fragility .\" even holbrooke's main opponent in the war in bosnia, bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic, expressed \"sadness and regret\" over holbrooke's unexpected death monday. but in afghanistan, the taliban rejoiced at news of his death, claiming it was caused by failures in the u.s.-led war there and holbrooke's \"grappling with a constant psychological stress\" from his position as president barack obama's special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan. \"the protracted afghan war and the descending trajectory of the americans' handling of the warfare in the country had a lethal dent on holbrooke's health,\" the group said on jihadi websites. legendary diplomatic skills in brussels, nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen paid tribute to holbrooke's legendary diplomatic skills, saying he played an essential role in the 1995 dayton agreement that ended the bosnian war and lauding his work in afghanistan. as obama's special envoy, holbrooke realized \"that we sometimes have to defend our security by facing conflicts in distant places,\" fogh rasmussen said tuesday. afghan president hamid karzai and pakistani leader asif ali zardari also praised holbrooke, who died at 69, though holbrooke's style did not play as well with karzai as it did with balkan leaders. aides said karzai considered the american envoy ignorant of afghan culture. german foreign minister guido westerwelle said the world should be grateful to holbrooke for his contribution to the international strategy in afghanistan. holbrooke earned the nickname the bulldozer after he bullied warring serbs, croats and muslims to agree to end the bosnian war with sometimes risky diplomatic overtures. swedish foreign minister carl bildt, who served as an envoy to bosnia in the early 1990s, said the strategy gave holbrooke many close friends but also many enemies. british officials also offered tribute. \"he will always be remembered for his pre-eminent role in ending the vicious war in bosnia, where his force of personality and his negotiating skill combined to drive through the dayton peace agreement and put a halt to the fighting,\" prime minister <mark>david cameron</mark> said in london. \"an unjust peace, but still a peace' not all bosnians admired holbrooke's efforts to achieve peace, arguing that the multiethnic state he set up as part of the dayton peace process had proven too unwieldy for effective governance .\" he was instrumental in bringing peace to bosnia. an unjust peace, but still a peace, \"said haris silajdzic, bosnia's wartime foreign minister who participated in the dayton negotiations. but sarajevo's citizens, who suffered a 3? - year siege during the bosnian war that killed thousands, were more positive about holbrooke's legacy .\" the dayton agreement was reached to end the war, but it is no longer good for us and the time has come to change it, \"said dalila cikusic, a sarajevo resident .\" but that has nothing to do with holbrooke, we must do it ourselves...as far as richard is concerned, i only have words of praise for him. \"in kosovo, prime minister hashim thaci has proposed naming a square after holbrooke in the capital of pristina for his role in

silvers. <mark>joseph campbell</mark> were water cooler conversation? it was 1988 and we all wanted to \"follow our bliss'. we wanted to\" make our heart sing'. and it sounded easy enough to do. so? how'd that work out for you? trying to follow our bliss is a little bit like trying to grab smoke. the more we struggle, the more elusive it becomes. twenty-two years later and i'm beginning to realize that while bliss is nice, it shouldn't be the goal. these days, i'm inclined to believe bliss is the reward for a living my truth. these days, it's chutzpah that makes my heart sing. last night i was organizing a few computer files and i stumbled upon a blog post i wrote three years ago. the mimm back than has managed to encourage this mimm. and so i'm posting the essay again. yes, i'm one of them. i'm one of those people who want to write a book. we're a dime a dozen. we fill cyberspace, bookstores, writing clinics, and book clubs. and how many of us will actually make it past verbally expressing our deepest secret: \"i want to write a book .\" i imagine, very few. i'm thinking about this because i'm sitting in a public space. i'm people watching in between paragraphs. a few moments ago one of my yoga students happened by and asked what i was up to. i explained the blog, and the daily entry i promised my life coach and myself. i explained, too, how i hoped to move out of body therapy over the next few years to focus on writing. she then proceeded to tell me the amazing story of her friend who decided that most children's books were rubbish and that she would write her own. rather than stopping there, she actually did it. she wrote the book, she found an illustrator and then she hooked up with an agent! the book hasn't been published, but i don't doubt for a moment that it will be. chutzpah. the woman has chutzpah. and we all know a little chutzpah goes a long way to realizing a dream. when an idea makes our heart sing, why do we try to stop the music? if i invested as much time trying to achieve my goals as i do telling myself why they're impossible, think of how much closer i'd be to having them become living, breathing reality. my yoga student's friend decided to write a book, and from the moment she made that decision, the book existed. i can decide, right now, this moment, to have not just her chutzpah, but her conviction and clarity of vision. so what's stopping me? like be the first to like this post. i love yoga. and i love to write. after that my passion for these disciplines is such that i find it hard to put in words. there are joyous moments in teaching when \"it' happens. a student has a shift in perspective, moves deeper into her body, feels a new flow of energy. there are rare moments in writing when the characters take over and the words flow. i live for those moments. growing up in rural pennsylvania i would have never predicted this life. my friends and i guessed, as young girls in the early' 70? s, that there would be husbands, some kids, split level homes and probably a few shaggy dogs. i watched kim and barbara, becky and patty move into their dream lives. and i tried to move into mine. but after college and a very brief marriage i decided i had some things to get out of my system first. i could settle down later - the type of life my friends settled into so easily would still be waiting for me after i had a little adventure. many years and adventures later - including ten years in donegal, ireland - i have to admit that the choices i made, the path i carved with the tools i was given, has meant

williams</mark>, my collaborator in the group 11,000 switches. he said, \"man, turn the radio to waif, i'm doing a show .\" i found my radio speaking with a new voice. at its most challenging, it had previously palpitated with the soothing strains of o.t., wguc's echt-serious music of our time, new wave with <mark>michael riley</mark>, t-bone, greg doll, craig kelley and others on waif and free jazz on miles ingram's no more white gloves. but here was something that incorporated all of that yet added silly novelty numbers, progressive rock, zappa, homemade electronic music, no wave and industrial. soon i joined <mark>dan</mark> as his radio collaborator; greg fernandez also contributed through the summer until the fall when he moved to columbus and created on ohio state university's wosr. after <mark>dan</mark> left in 1987, i continued as sole host through 1990 when i was able to bring in chris lockhart, mark milano and iovae to provide relief in the long, late-night time slot. i have no idea how we were able to build a following at such an hour, but art damage thrived. the homemade tape cutup aspect of the show garnered a lot of interest; we began to receive pieces from listeners ranging from <mark>james robbins</mark> (now an editor at the washington times) to caf gallahad, then a college freshman whom today, as nebulagirl, serves as the queen bee around which much experimental media activity in cincinnati continues to buzz. as far as i know, it was the only radio show where you could hear president reagan talking about poisoned meat, elvis presley's \"jailhouse rock\" played backwards, ricardo montalban warning against marijuana use, cabaret voltaire and bob braun in the same 10-minute brace. i left art damage in 1991 and it continued on, ultimately adding and subtracting a long list of hosts including android and justin (the current hosts of waif's another music from a different kitchen), robert inhuman of realicide, chris roesing, scott hisey (of gordy horn), c. spencer yeh, keith larsen, jack ison, nebulagirl, steven french, miranda of liquid death/hello pussy records and gabe molnar, a leibniz scholar who now teaches in montreal. some tended to specialize and this meant that the glorious crash collision of conflicting genres that characterized earlier art damage shows was softened, but everyone involved had their particular spin, adding something positive to the dialogue. the art damage foundation, which supports and promotes live, local performances of experimental music, came into existence when waif suddenly cancelled art damage in the middle of its 19th year. (the show returned to waif in 2008. it airs midnight-2 a.m. monday nights .) \"part of the complaint was that art damage was not generating enough money during pledge drives,\" chris roesing recalls. \"so in january 2005 we organized a live benefit at the mockbee gallery that lasted three days. we offered the money to waif, but at the time they weren't interested. so we thought,\" what are we going to do with this money?' i was just finishing my mba at ccm in arts administration, so we incorporated the art damage foundation as a 501 (c) 3 non-profit. \"the art damage lodge was established in the fall of 2007 and has since provided a stable venue for the foundation's activities. but this friday and saturday's shows will be the last ones at the lodge, which is operated by wasteland jazz unit members jon lorenz and <mark>john rich</mark>.\" a new owner bought the building, \"<mark>rich</mark> says of the northside space .\" she wants to continue it as a concert venue and we don't really fit into those plans. \"the art damage foundation has largely built a reputation for featuring industrial noise music and they have forged relationships with established noisemeisters like michigan's wolf eyes. however, <mark>rich</mark> feels that this reputation limits perception of their efforts .\" jon and i have really grown to hate the \"noise' tag that has been applied to us,\" <mark>rich</mark> says. \"we have a lot of different offerings that don't fall into the noise mode .\" indeed, at the lodge i once saw conservatory trained cellist audrey chen play a set with her group kamama and discovered the awesome talent of eddy kwon, a ccm student who combines traditional chinese violin styles with a raga-like type of improvisation - experimental, but not \"noise .\" there are some things no one will miss about the lodge, mainly the four flights of stairs that lead up to the third floor and make the simple act of carrying an amplifier into the venue a major source of discomfort. the foundation will continue, but a new venue is still being sought. \"jon and i think it's important to stay in northside,\" says <mark>rich</mark>, \"as it is central to the arts in this town, but right now we're just running out of time .\" when i asked robert inhuman what his take on the art damage experience was, he replied, \"art damage radio really was my first exposure to experimental music on a local level. later, the art damage foundation further aided in establishing my own subcultural identity within punk media that desired to go against stereotypes and expectations in cincinnati .\" in some ways, art damage was what initially armed me and my friends for everything that would transpire in the following years with realicide, \"inhuman says .\" it has been very nice to see the lodge lasting over three years at a good location and i wish them the best in whatever comes next. \"art damage presents the last shows at northside's art damage lodge (", "articleID": "2010121520_00049798_W", "names": {"Dan Williams": ["Q16196768", "Q20643078", "Q25927228", "Q3013248", "Q42152193", "Q5214596", "Q5214598"], "James Robbins": ["Q14945457", "Q3805136"], "John Rich": ["Q16225998", "Q3182358", "Q3456867", "Q6254722"], "Michael Riley": ["Q1616959", "Q6833864", "Q6833865"]}}, {"date": "2010-12-17", "url": "http://theargus.co.uk/news/8742818.Loan_sharks_warning_in_Sussex/?ref=rss", "content": "loan sharks are preying on people who need money to get them through christmas. trading standards officers are warning people to use credit unions and avoid unlicensed lenders. staff at east sussex credit union, which is based at community base in queens road, brighton, said they regularly receive anecdotal reports of loan sharking. manager colin holden said: \"we always hear rumours that they are about but because of the nature of these guys, people are not prepared to talk about it .\" we know that there are loan sharks circulating in brighton, and also places like lewes and eastbourne, but it is anecdotal evidence. \"<mark>richard jones</mark>, general manager of west sussex credit union in crescent road, worthing, said he suspects illegal lending is taking place in worthing and crawley. he said:\" it is difficult to give any tangible evidence but you can make a lot of assumptions. \"there are a lot of legal and illegal companies that charge extortionate rates of interest .\" east sussex county council is also warning people to avoid loan sharks. anyone with information about illegal money-lending is asked to call trading standards on 0300 555 2222, or consumer direct on 08454 040506 to contact east sussex credit union, call 01273 234 858, or visit www.eastsussexcu.org.uk.to contact west sussex credit union, call 01903 237221, or visit www.westsussexcreditunion.co.uk. search for jobs in brighton, hove, lewes, worthing, crawley and more...find the right person in brighton, hove, lewes, worthing, crawley...search for homes in brighton, worthing, hove, lewes ...", "articleID": "2010121712_00125954_W", "names": {"Richard Jones": ["Q10441659", "Q16240149", "Q16657311", "Q16730413", "Q20733697", "Q21165389", "Q24548883", "Q27526204", "Q29643075", "Q3430918", "Q39073418", "Q51589381", "Q5358141", "Q55965900", "Q56598113", "Q56598126", "Q56604646", "Q57415949", "Q57416543", "Q59510267", "Q7326923", "Q7326924", "Q7326927", "Q7326932", "Q7326934", "Q7326936", "Q7326940", "Q7326941"]}}]
