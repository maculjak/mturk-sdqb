The 1969 Austin van is said to be one of only seven left in the world and once belonged to <mark>David Thomas</mark>, a former English and PE teacher known as Dynamite Danny due to his football prowess. After years of teaching in London, he moved back to his hometown of Penycae in Wrexham but became a recluse, according to his brother Terry, a former lecturer in forestry and agriculture economics at Bangor University.

including, inevitably, saudi arabia. each country will move at its own pace, but if revolution is to be avoided, the reform process must progress toward genuine democracy. in an interview with the bbc last week, <mark>king abdullah</mark> predicted the arab spring was \"not even halfway through.\" if that is true, the way to invite the \"chaos\" kuwait's emir is warning would be for his regime and others to resist the imperative for change."}, {"articleID": "2009032713_00043869_W", "names": {"Jeff Carter": ["Q6173518", "Q6173521", "Q6173523", "Q943565"]}, "date": "2009-03-27", "url": "http://counton2.com/cbd/news/national/article/wanted_u.s._marshals_body_found_in_mexico/22787/", "content": "cnn published: march 27, 2009 (cnn) - the body of a fugitive u.s. marshal has been found in the city of juarez, mexico, according to the u.s. marshals service-the latest discovery in a wave of violence that has gripped towns along the u.s.-mexican border in recent months. the body of deputy marshal vincent bustamante-who faced federal charges of stealing weapons and other government property-was found in juarez on wednesday, said marshals service spokesman <mark>jeff carter</mark>. bustamante appeared to have been shot in the back of the head, a federal law enforcement source said. chihuahua state police said the body had multiple wounds to the head-apparently consistent with an execution-style shooting, according to edgar roman, a reporter with xhij television in juarez. bustamante, 48, was charged with stealing u.s. government property including glock and ruger handguns, a shotgun and a pair of binoculars, according to court documents. according to the federal source, who was not authorized to speak about details of the case and asked not to be named, a pawnshop owner became suspicious when bustamante attempted to pawn a shotgun and called the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. the source said bustamante would buy back items he had pawned on his pay days and return them. bustamante's attorney, mike torres, said a warrant was issued for bustamante's arrest after he failed to appear at a court hearing last week. he said bustamante was a 17-year veteran of the marshals and a former el paso police officer who lived in el paso with his wife and two children. \"he was a familiar face around the federal courthouse here,\" torres said. \"i'm very shocked by this and very saddened.\" he had a lot of friends and a lot of people that cared about him. \"<mark>carter</mark> said bustamante was on administrative leave from the marshals and had been required to turn in his gun and badge. he said bustamante had not been in mexico on marshals business and that all of the weapons he was charged with stealing had been recovered. <mark>carter</mark> said bustamante was on\" modified status \"with the marshals, meaning he had been required to turn in his gun and badge outside of his official work hours.\" what i can tell you is that the u.s. marshals service is saddened by the death of deputy bustamante and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, \"he said. <mark>carter</mark> said u.s. marshals are working with the fbi and mexican authorities to investigate the death. he said an autopsy will be conducted in mexico, and another may be conducted once bustamante's body is returned to the united states. juarez, which sits across the border from el paso, texas, has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and mexican authorities. the conflict has made violence increasingly common in juarez, tijuana and other mexican border towns. more than 400 deaths in the region have been attributed to the fighting this year .) please avoid offensive, vulgar, or hateful language. dash cam video: nfl player's mother-in-law dies while dealing with police"}, {"articleID": "2013061508_00037760_W", "names": {"Sandro Silva": ["Q1851114", "Q2707256"], "Jimmy Kimmel": ["Q20793563", "Q4914"]}, "date": "2013-06-15", "url": "http://www.complex.com/music/2013/06/watch-king-louie-send-it-up-kanye-west", "content": "Watch: King Louie Talk About Creating \"Send It Up\" WIth Kanye West As most of you probably already know, King Louie is one of the featured artist on Kanye West's album, Yeezus.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP)--If Tennessee's Quinten Dormady improves as much throughout the season as he did over the course of his first career start, the Volunteers won't have to worry about their quarterback situation. After winning a preseason competition with redshirt freshman Jarrett Guarantano, Dormady struggled initially but came on strong down the stretch to spark the 25th-ranked Volunteers to a 42-41 double-overtime victory over Georgia Tech. The performance should give Dormady a confidence boost heading into Tennessee's home opener Saturday with Football Championship Subdivision program Indiana State (0-1). His second-half surge certainly caught the attention of his teammates. \"I'm really proud of him, how he handled himself,\" running back <mark>John Kelly</mark> said. Dormady said he wasn't particularly nervous about making his first start, but the statistics show how much he improved as the game wore on. After going 8 of 20 for 52 yards in the first half, Dormady was 12 of 17 for 169 yards with two touchdown passes the rest of the way. Tennessee coaches had talked during the preseason about the possibility of playing both Dormady and Guarantano in the opener, but Dormady said he didn't look over his shoulder or worry about the possibility of getting pulled from the game during his early struggles. \"I wasn't focused on that,\" Dormady said. \"I was just focused on executing. It took us a little while to get going, but when we finally did hit (our) stride, it felt pretty good out there.\" Dormady never did get removed from the game, and he eventually rewarded the coaching staff's faith in him. He led Tennessee (1-0) to touchdowns on five of its last six possessions, including a game-tying 93-yard drive in the final five minutes of regulation. He never got sacked and didn't commit any turnovers. His performance should provide some hope that Tennessee has found a capable replacement for Joshua Dobbs, who started 35 games over the last four seasons before getting drafted in the fourth round by the Pittsburgh Steelers. \"I can't say enough about Quinten,\" offensive tackle Brett Kendrick said. \"He always had his composure. He reminded me a lot of Dobbs (in that) was a calming presence on the sideline. There's no worry in him. You always want someone like that in a quarterback.\" Dormady's emergence in the second half and overtime was particularly noteworthy because it came without Jauan Jennings, who started the season as Tennessee's top returning receiver. Jennings got injured in the first half of the Georgia Tech game and is out indefinitely. Jennings' absence will force Dormady to develop a rhythm with Tennessee's other receivers. He already appears to have found a favorite target in Marquez Callaway, who caught four passes for 115 yards and two touchdowns against Georgia Tech. Tennessee's matchup with Indiana State should help Dormady build that trust with receivers while also correcting mistakes he made in the opener. \"For me, I think it's just making the easy throws,\" Dormady said. \"That comes with me and the receivers, just with our timing and things ....We'll get things fixed. That will probably be the biggest jump. We've just got to make the routine plays.\" The Indiana State game also should provide an opportunity for Guarantano to make his debut. Television cameras during the Georgia Tech game showed Guarantano sitting apart from Dormady on the sideline without wearing a headset, leading to questions about how the redshirt freshman was handling the backup role. Guarantano hasn't been made available to the media this week, but Tennessee coach Butch Jones spoke out in the redshirt freshman's defense and noted his backup quarterbacks typically don't wear headsets during games. \"They'll continue to compete\" Jones said. \"I know there was a lot out there with Jarrett, and all I can tell you is Jarrett's a good teammate. He's always been a good teammate. He's a competitor and wants to be it there but also has a tremendous amount of respect for everyone in this program and the players.\" NOTE: Tennessee announced Thursday that reserve cornerback Baylen Buchanan has an ankle injury that will prevent him from playing against Indiana State. ___ More AP college football: http: //collegefootball.ap.org and https: //twitter.com/AP_Top25 ___ Follow Steve Megargee at www.twitter.com/stevemegargee Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

semi-finalists in last season's competition, everton were without the injured marouane fellaini but made a purposeful start and took the lead in the 15th minute. after a patient build-up, darron gibson shaped a beautiful cross into the box from deep on the right and mirallas stole in to finish with an adroit half-volley from eight yards. oldham almost drew level immediately through former everton youngster jose baxter, who seized on a loose ball on the edge of the box but saw his curling shot bounce back off the right-hand upright. the visitors then had a penalty appeal turned down when phil jagielka's clearance struck gibson on the arm. their resurgence proved short-lived, however, as baines helped everton stamp their authority on the tie. having seen a vicious strike saved by oldham goalkeeper dean bouzanis minutes earlier, the england left-back doubled his side's advantage from the penalty spot in the 34th minute after <mark>connor brown</mark> was penalised for handball. everton centre-back jagielka blazed over the oldham bar early in the second half, while bouzanis saved from osman. in response, oldham introduced giant striker <mark>smith</mark>, scorer of two goals against liverpool and an injury-time equaliser in the first game with everton. oldham rallied, lee croft firing wide from a good position, but in the 62nd minute, everton struck again. steven pienaar

million domestically, according to studio estimates sunday. \"brave\" added $13.5 million in 10 overseas markets for a worldwide start of $80.2 million. featuring a feisty scottish princess, \"brave\" was the first of disney's pixar animations with a female protagonist. and it left american hero abraham lincoln in the dust. the 20th century fox action tale \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter\" opened far back at no. 3 with $16.5 million, behind \"madagascar 3: europe's most wanted.\" dreamworks animation's animated \"madagascar\" sequel had been no. 1 for two weekends and added $20.2 million to raise its domestic total to $157.6 million. \"brave\" is the 13th-straight pixar release to open at no. 1 since \"toy story\" launched hollywood's age of computer animation in 1995. \"their track record is just unbelievable,\" said paul dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker hollywood.com. \"the pixar brand just carries so much weight with the audience, it doesn't matter almost what the story is about if it has the pixar name.\" the weekend's other new wide release, steve carell and keira knightley's apocalyptic romance \"seeking a friend for the end of the world,\" misfired with just $3.8 million, debuting at no. 10. the focus features film, playing in much narrower release than other top-10 movies, stars carell and knightley as heartbroken neighbors on a road trip as a killer asteroid hurtles toward earth. woody allen's italian romance \"to rome with love\" pulled in huge audiences in limited release, debuting with $379,371 in five theaters. that gave the sony pictures classics release a whopping average of $75,874 a theater, compared to $16,028 in 4,164 cinemas for \"brave.\" \"brave\" features a voice cast led by <mark>kelly macdonald</mark> and <mark>emma thompson</mark> in a mother-daughter story of a young scottish princess defying tradition that requires her to marry against her will. the film proved that audiences will turn up for a female hero, not just the male protagonists of past pixar flicks, such as woody and buzz of \"toy story,\" the robot of \"wall-e\" or the rat and his chef buddy of \"ratatouille.\" \"brave\" matched the $66.1 million debut of pixar's \"cars 2,\" with male automotive lead lightning mcqueen, over the same weekend a year ago. \"it is a phenomenal thing, these guys and their mastery of big storytelling and character development, delivering something that plays well to adults as well as kids, to girls as well as boys,\" dave hollis, disney's head of distribution, said of pixar. the audience for \"brave\" did lean toward females, who accounted for 57 percent of viewers. two-thirds of the film's business came from families, who also continued to flock to \"madagascar 3,\" making a rare weekend when two pg-rated movies led the box office. the r-rated \"abraham lincoln: vampire hunter\" was a clever idea the 16th u.s. president waging his own civil war against the blood-suckers of the republic. but critics were unimpressed, and action fans had only a passing interest in the movie, which featured relative unknown <mark>benjamin walker</mark> as lincoln. still, it was made for $69 million, a modest budget for a summer action movie, and 20th century fox had hopes it would hold up well over the next week or so before \"the amazing spider-man\" and \"the dark knight rises\" swoop in to take over cinemas in july. \"it's actually a good start for this movie,\" said chris aronson, the studio's head of distribution. \"this is an interesting and untested genre that i think audiences are going to continue to seek out. mash-ups have been done, but the historical mash-up has not been done.\" estimated ticket sales for friday through sunday at u.s. and canadian theaters, according to hollywood.com. where available, latest international numbers are also included. final domestic figures will be released monday. 1. \"brave,\" $66.7 million ($13.5 million international).

brian rolston scored the only goal for the offensively-challenged devils (34-16-2), who've scored just 12 times during an eight-game stretch in which they've won just twice (2-5-1). \"we did a good

tired teams,\" ruff said. \"there was only pockets of energy here and there.\" mair gave buffalo the early lead with his second of the year with 5:46 to go in the first period. standing in front of

Democrat of Virginia, has cruised to a victory even though Virginia newspapers didn't endorse him Jeff South, The Conversation 2017-11-14T11:00:05 Z \u2022 2017-11-14T11:00:05 Z \u2022 0 Comments 0 Comments This piece originally appeared on The Conversation. Ralph Northam, a folksy Democrat from the Eastern Shore, beat out <mark>Ed Gillespie</mark>, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, in Virginia's heated gubernatorial race. Northam's victory was remarkably comfortable. He won with 54 percent of the vote. His opponent, a Washington lobbyist who sought to distance himself from President Donald Trump, received 45 percent. But you would have predicted just the opposite if you had been following newspaper endorsements in Virginia leading up to Election Day. I'm a journalism professor, so I was closely following the media's engagement in this election. And over the past month or so, I observed with interest as most of Virginia's newspapers favored <mark>Gillespie</mark> over Northam, a pediatric neurologist who served six years as a Virginia state senator and four as the state's lieutenant governor. Who got it wrong The Richmond Times-Dispatch, in an Oct. 27 editorial, for example, praised <mark>Gillespie</mark> for running \"an energetic, inclusive, moderate-conservative, solutions-oriented campaign.\" In a swipe at Northam, the paper said <mark>Gillespie</mark> \"knows, unlike most Democrats, that more government spending is not the cure for all that ails society.\" Newspapers in Roanoke, Fredericksburg, Winchester, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg and Halifax also urged readers to vote for <mark>Gillespie</mark>. One week later, in early November, the editorial board of the Daily Progress, Charlottesville's local paper, opined that because Republicans also control Virginia's General Assembly, \"we believe <mark>Ed Gillespie</mark> has the best chance of leading Virginia to a brighter economic future.\" The editors of The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg agreed. \"Unlike his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, <mark>Gillespie</mark> is not in favor of expanding Medicaid,\" they asserted just days before Northam would go on to win Virginia, a Republican stronghold turned swing state. In the end, Northam received endorsements from only three newspapers: The Virginian-Pilot, in Norfolk, where he now lives; the Daily Press of nearby Newport News; and the Washington Post. Credibility problem As Northam cruised to his nine-point victory over <mark>Gillespie</mark>, I couldn't help but think that maybe it's time for newspapers to stop telling their dwindling number of subscribers how to vote. News organizations already have a credibility problem: Polls show that only 13 percent of Americans trust their local paper \"a lot.\" And while journalists swear there's a wall between the editorial staff that endorses candidates and the reporters who write the news, many readers are skeptical: They suspect that a newspaper's endorsement influences what should be objective coverage. In my opinion, getting out of the endorsement game would help newspapers regain trust, fend off charges of bias and show respect for the public's decision-making abilities. Some opt out Some news organizations are starting to recognize this. In the runup to the gubernatorial election, the editorial board of the Martinsville Bulletin wrote that the newspaper wouldn't be making endorsements in state or local races: \"It's not for a lack of interest. It's that we truly do not feel it's our job to tell any of you who to vote for.\" The Martinsville Bulletin, which serves communities along Virginia's border with North Carolina, questioned the point of endorsements: A person or organization announces who they support, with the implication everyone else should follow suit. We see that as tricky for a news organization, where the goal is to be objective. If we do a piece on candidate X, but we've endorsed candidate Y, how can you be expected to trust it? That's a valiant acknowledgment from a small-town paper, but newspaper endorsements--no matter their credibility or weight--won't be easy to extirpate. They have a very long history in the United States. During the presidential election of 1860, for example, the editorial page of The New York Times announced its support for \"Mr. Lincoln, of Illinois, familiarly known as\" Old Abe,' age 51, height six feet seven, by profession Rail-Splitter. \"Abraham Lincoln won that election, of course. But overall, newspaper endorsements have had mixed results in influencing voters or forecasting election outcomes. Most papers, for instance, endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump last fall--and were soundly repudiated at the polls. Bad for business It's not just arrogant for newspapers to issue endorsements in elections--it may also be financially unwise. Newspapers already face severe economic challenges as they lose readers--and thus advertising--to digital platforms. Readers turned off by an endorsement are likely to seek their news elsewhere. Digital outlets like Slate and BuzzFeed do not endorse candidates. Indeed, in Virginia you could already see signs of readers' rejection of this blatant display of politics in the media. In the comments reacting to the Richmond Times-Dispatch's endorsement of <mark>Gillespie</mark>, one person wrote,\" If the RTD thinks he is a wise choice, I now understand why the RTD is losing readership. \"Not the best move, in the end. Screenshot, Richmond Times Dispatch Many media experts believe that for newspapers to survive, they must position themselves as community forums--platforms for engaging the audience and fostering a dialogue. That means hosting a conversation, not delivering a lecture. By forgoing endorsements, newspapers could better fulfill that role: They would be making a statement that news organizations provide impartial information--and readers should act on it as they see fit. Plus, if Virginia's race is any indication, they're not so great at the endorsement game, anyway."}]
