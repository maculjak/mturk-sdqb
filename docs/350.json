Plans have been submitted for the development at Irelands Field, Heckington - between Boston Road and Cobham close - to North Kesteven District Council. Permission for a different development of 50 homes at the site was granted in 2014 and this application, which has also been earmarked for approval, would bring the total up to 100 homes on the site. READ MORE: \"We care about them deeply' - donkey owner hits back at attacks The properties will be accessed from Boston Road and a pond and trees in an area of open space are also included in the application. The application also states 35 per cent of the development should be so-called affordable housing .\" Heckington is an area of identified housing need, \"a council report states .\" The affordable housing should be well integrated into the overall design of the development and not segregated or concentrated together, nor should it be visually or operationally distinguishable from the market housing in terms of details, build quality and materials. \"Twelve people have objected to the scheme, raising concerns about the impact on schools and doctors facilities, as well as expressing unease at noise, extra traffic and the impact the homes would have on the landscape of the village. And Lincolnshire County Council has said it has concerns about the impact the development. It said:\" This development would result in a direct impact on local schools. In this case just the secondary schools at Sleaford are projected, notwithstanding the proposed development, to be full in the future to the permanent capacity of the schools. \"A contribution is therefore requested to mitigate against the impact of the development at local level. The level of contribution sought in this case equates to & pound; 171,350 based on nine secondary places and one school-based sixth form places being required as a direct consequence of this development .\" However, business owners in the village have welcomed the plans - with many feeling it will bring more shoppers. Owner of Sylv's Coffee Shop and Cafe, Sylvia Matson, said she would like to see more cheap housing in Heckington. She said: \"We need more housing. There are not enough houses for everybody to go round and if some are affordable then I'm all for it .\" Kids coming through the system need somewhere to live, renting is really expensive and if there is affordable housing there then it's brilliant. \"The only concern would be whether the schools and doctors can cope .\" Owner of the Windmill Shop, <mark>Andrew Franks</mark>, agreed that it would be good to have more housing in the village. He said: \"It would be good for me as it would generate more footfall .\" The building wouldn't bother me. More houses would be good for trade. It's a sign of the times - we need more houses so people will build. \"A decision on the application will be made by the district council planning committee on August 16.

For more of episode 2, we saw the main point of contention be the arrival of Josh Murray, where he in turn ended up taking Amanda Stanton on a date. This upset Nick Viall greatly, given that he was already starting up a relationship with her. He now feels like he's lost her, and he has to figure out what happened. What could he do to ensure that he figures all of this out? The synopsis below offers up a few clues--it's not confirmed that it is about Nick, but at the same time there aren't many other candidates at present it could be in reference to unless someone starts to date Carly Waddell in the near future after she spent time with Evan Bass:\" When one bachelor knows he is going home since he was recently dumped, he plants a fake date card addressed to him so he can tell his original love interest how he feels. The only glitch is the beauty is very much taken and is making out with her hunky guy when the desperate guy approaches. What will the notorious bachelor do when his woman is stolen from him mid-makeout? Will the underdog prevail? \"Ultimately, we think the words\" notorious bachelor \"are the biggest clue that this is Josh. What else makes sense?
