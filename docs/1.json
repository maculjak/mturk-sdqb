\"starkiller\" - was the original surname of luke skywalker in early drafts of the original star wars screenplay? or that babylon 5 showrunner j michael straczynski paid homage to this fact by giving his own lead character, <mark>john sheridan</mark>, the starkiller moniker as his nickname among the mysterious minbari? no? then be assured that i've now outlined my sci-fi geek credentials. you're in safe hands here. i've always ignored the litany of star wars expanded universe material. my view is that if a plot isn't canon, then balls to it. therefore the lucas-approved storyline in force unleashed, which fills in the squiggly bits between episodes iii and iv of the star wars saga, is the first major draw outside the movies for me personally, for years. just how did we get from the jedi being wiped out, to the fledgling rebel alliance? and what does the apprentice - who seemingly exists solely to do darth vader's duplicitously dirty, off-the-books bidding, rather than shouting \"that's what i'm talking abaaaaat!\" every five seconds - have to do with it all? the early story cutscenes are promising. the apprentice himself is surprisingly likeable and sympathetic rather than brimming with the expected genero-teen-angst evil, and an engaging droid character called proxy provides the funnies while having more than a little bit of sinister bite behind him. he doesn't even come across as an hk-47 rip-off, which is refreshing. the only downsides are darth vader's \"it's not really him, is it? why didn't you get <mark>james earl jones</mark>, you idiots?\" voice and subtly misjudged line-readings, which make you root for man-in-the-suit <mark>david prowse</mark> to finally be given the chance to utilise his \"the farrrrce is strang wiv you, moi luvver\" vocal talents. the first test, however, is easily passed. since the story isn't rubbish, force unleashed is automatically better than 99% of narrative-based games. but the other story here - the gameplay itself - is more troublesome, and force unleashed has many of the same problems that crop up again and again in third person action adventures. the major issue is the automatic targeting system, which is, frankly, broken. it selects your target very vaguely based on the direction in which you're facing, but there badly needs to be an option to switch manually, as in the middle of a fight against multiple enemies, with multiple targetable objects also around you, it's almost impossible to force grip the exact stormtrooper you really want to fling about. this leads to the game becoming rather more of a button-masher than it should be. with the targeting woes hampering efforts at precision, the best strategy is to hammer the lightsabre and various force buttons willy-nilly in order to rid the screen of all opposition. the euphoria engine (formerly seen in grand theft auto iv) proves itself to be the ideal technical gubbins to depict chaotic uses of the force here, with the requisite force grip and force push abilities all present, spangly and correct. the action often looks spectacular onscreen, with enemies flying through the air in multiple directions, and electronics being ripped out of their housings to explode all over the place, but when the button-mashing is compounded by the dreaded qte sequences that pop up when defeating some of the larger enemies and in boss battles, it often feels that you're not in complete control of the action. your inability to move while using the force, and the swiftly dwindling energy bar for use of the ability (presumably both present for difficulty balancing purposes), are the final nails in the coffin. having seen jedis fight in the movies, the force unleashed's control problems and restrictions make the combat more old man guinness than young pretender mcgregor. the game isn't helped by the level paths' extreme linearity either, which almost jedi mind tricked me into thinking that n + is a free-roaming extravaganza. still, the art design is absolutely lovely, the music recognisably star wars, and general presentation - apart from the screen tearing and some clunky loading times - is everything you'd expect from a big budget game. certainly the compulsion to get to the next slice of the plot will overcome many of the gameplay problems for star wars fans. however, for anyone who has no interest in the story and has been fooled by the hype into expecting combat on the level of a ninja gaiden or devil may cry, this probably isn't the game you're looking for. darth vader, everyone's favourite intergalactic sir alan sugar, certainly shouldn't fire his apprentice at this point, but neither should he rush to hire him quite yet.", "articleID": "2008091810_00029341_W", "names": {"David Prowse": ["Q128379", "Q5238735"], "James Earl Jones": ["Q203960", "Q2074528"], "John Sheridan": ["Q28007064", "Q30095126", "Q41453110", "Q42806284", "Q552767", "Q6257622", "Q6257625", "Q6257627"]}}, {"date": "2008-09-22", "url": "http://au.rd.yahoo.com/news/rss/top_stories/*http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/5031408", "content": "rees \"filthy': glitch sparks more m5 chaos abc -

09:52 a.m. united nations (ap) - leaders from poland, norway, denmark and indonesia on wednesday pressed for a global climate treaty to replace the kyoto protocol next year but said prospects were extremely unfavorable. some said replacing the 1997 global warming accord depends largely on the united states dropping its opposition to participating, and whether wealthy and poorer nations can bridge their differences over technology-sharing and cutting emissions. the u.s. rejected the kyoto protocol, arguing it would harm american business and didn't require similar cuts by china, india and other emerging economies. but those developing countries have refused to accept a binding arrangement that would limit their development. \"without the united states, we can never succeed,\" said norwegian environment minister <mark>erik solheim</mark>. \"if the americans are not moving, anyone else who does not want to move will hide behind the americans .\" the new accord is expected to aim for global cuts of 50 percent by 2050, below the 1990 levels of carbon emissions. \"there is very little progress and there is reason to be concerned about the progress of the negotiations aiming at reaching an agreement in 2009,\" norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said at one of several climate-related gatherings wednesday held on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly's annual ministerial session. \"the main reason why there is too little progress is distrust, is the lack of confidence between the rich world and the developing world,\" he said. \"and that's because the rich world promised in kyoto, in 1997, to transfer knowledge, capital to assist the developing world with creating sustainable development. that hasn't happened - at least to a very limited amount or scale .\" that's also why, he said, norway agreed to donate $35 million in startup money for a new u.n. program announced wednesday aimed at curbing deforestation. the program will pay for more monitoring and verification of tropical rainforests, as part of an effort to persuade rich nations to reward developing countries for conserving and expanding their remaining forest cover. chopping down trees contributes to climate warming by eliminating plant material that absorbs carbon dioxide, and by releasing the dead wood into the atmosphere as more carbon. by helping reverse the rapid pace of deforestation in the tropics, proponents envision the possibility of cutting greenhouse gas emission globally by up to 20 percent.", "articleID": "2008092514_00025880_W", "names": {"Erik Solheim": ["Q1354155", "Q17107965"]}}, {"date": "2008-09-27", "url": "http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=28126352&blogID=436384871", "content": "what if the disappearance of the bees is caused by superpesticides? there's been allot of news lately about the honey bee colony collapse disorder. based on current reports the world has lost approximately 70-80% of our honey bee stocks. honey bees, monarch butterflies, and amphibians please study the facts regarding i.g. farben and take it upon yourself to further investigate the beginnings of the pharmaceutical racket and plan for entered into a joint venture with i.g. farbenfabriken (i. g. farben), the financial core of the hitler regime and the key supplier of poison gas to the nazi racial extermination program. (ig farben built 300 concentration camps, made money off of slave labor and produced zyclon b and cyanide). after the holocaust, the german chemical firm joined with american counterparts in the development of chemical warfare agents and founded the \"chemagrow corporation\" in kansas city, missouri, a front that employed german and american specialists on behalf of the u.s. army chemical corps. \"ig farben was never shut down, even though the prosecuting attorney at the nuremberg trial said ig farben should be tried for war crimes and if we did not stop them they would continue criminal activities. it broke into 3 companies: german multinationals bayer, basf and hoechst, the i.g. farben cartel was founded with a total number of employees surpassing 80,000. the race for global control was on. hoechst and bayer, the largest and third largest companies in world pharmaceutical sales respectively, are descended from i.g. farben. in september 1955, hoechst appointed friedrich jaehne, a convicted war criminal from the nuremberg trials, as chairman of its supervisory board. also, a year later, bayer appointed fitz ter meer, another convicted war criminal, as chairman of its board. so the quick rundown is this...reated superpesticides that are killing our bees which is a form of population control because people will die from starvation. germany has had it with them and is doing a smackdown right now! basf tried to make it illegal to buy or sell vitamins and herbs and got slapped with the biggest lawsuit in the history of the vitamin/herb industry. hoeshst has a subsidiary called roche that has produced the avian flu vaccine.
