But the Red Sox have been assured that is not the case. According to a baseball source, tests administered over the weekend led doctors in both Boston and Denver to believe that Ellsbury \"could not have damaged the bone further nor will he\" once he returns. Likewise, Red Sox manager <mark>John Farrell</mark> said the team inquired about the possibility that Ellsbury did additional damage and was told that a comparison of X-rays and MRI scans taken after the initial injury occurred Aug. 28 and last weekend supported the notion that Ellsbury didn't make things worse by playing. Ellsbury's foot will remain in a walking boot for another few days, according to <mark>Farrell</mark>. The center fielder will rejoin the Red Sox on Friday at Fenway Park, and before he resumes physical activity, he will be reexamined by team orthopedist Dr. Peter Asnis and foot specialist Dr. George Theodore at Mass General Hospital. \"To what extent any activities, even if that's the time frame for it to begin, we'll have a better read on that when he's seen,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. A few other notes before Clay Buchholz makes his first start since June 8:--The decision to put Dustin Pedroia in the leadoff spot was made with more than one game in mind. <mark>Farrell</mark> said Pedroia may be a better choice to lead off than Shane Victorino because he's a more patient hitter who sees more pitches. Victorino also has had great success in the No. 2 spot, so <mark>Farrell</mark> is tempted to leave him there. And by moving Pedroia to the top of the order, <mark>David Ortiz</mark> can move into the No. 3 spot, meaning the Red Sox will bring arguably their three best hitters to the plate in the first inning. Although Pedroia hasn't batted leadoff since 2009, he expressed a willingness to do so in Ellsbury's absence. \"It's only the first time up. That's it,\" he said. \"After that, it's pretty much the same.\" <mark>Farrell</mark> added, \"There was a little back and forth on it, and to his credit, he kind of brought it out initially and we kind of talked about it a little yesterday. I think this gives us a good look against a left-hander. One thing that we've really worked at is maintaining continuity, and if this is one that will give us that continuity until Jacoby returns, we're certainly willing to stay the course.\" --With Rays ace lefty <mark>David Price</mark> on the mound, rookie center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. isn't in the lineup. <mark>Farrell</mark> said Bradley \"is going to be in the mix\" to replace Ellsbury, but in certain matchups, the Red Sox will go with Victorino in center field and both Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava on the corners. \"We're not locked into any one thing,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"The fortunate thing is we've got depth and options.\" --Jarrod Saltalamacchia is back behind the plate tonight, although <mark>Farrell</mark> indicated he likely won't play more than back-to-back games because he's still managing some lower back soreness. \"He feels like he can go every day, which we love about him,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"I think it's probably smart, given what he dealt with, that we not run him out there every single day. But he's going to get the majority of the reps behind the plate. I'm not going to say it's going to be every other day by any means, but I'm a little bit leery right now to run him out there three consecutive days.\" --Despite being skipped for at least one turn in the rotation, lefty Felix Doubront will throw an extended bullpen session. \"There's some delivery work we've got to continue to address,\" <mark>Farrell</mark> said. \"He and (pitching coach) Jobs with Herald Media For back copy and collectible issue information please call 617-619-6265 .?

Asteroid Apophis terror: NASA reveals date asteroid could hit Earth Life after death: Shock study finds thousands who remember \"past life' The question of whether life continues after death has been at the forefront of research carried out a the University of Virginia Medical Center in the US.

Professor <mark>Bruce Greyson</mark> who took part in the lecture discussed some of the more bizarre NDEs he has come across through his research.

The psychiatrist did, however, notice experiences of an afterlife were influenced by cultural norms. He said:\" For example, near-death experiences of third world countries do not talk about entering a tunnel the way Americans do. They would talk about entering a cave or a well. \"One truck driver I interviewed, talked about entering a tailpipe. So you have to use whatever cultural metaphors at your disposal to describe the phenomenon.\" So our NDErs are just reporting what they expect to happen when they come close to death. \"According to the NHS, there is a strong possibility people who stand on the verge of dying hold onto consciousness. If blood still runs through the brain, it is plausible people will still see lights and hear voices they later confuse with an afterlife experience.

The hashtag \"TotsSomBarcelona\" (We are all Barcelona) will be displayed on the front of the players' shirts when the team hosts Real Betis on Sunday at Camp Nou. The club said it received special authorization from the Spanish soccer federation to make the changes. Barcelona said club members playing in various age divisions over the weekend will also wear a black armband in honor of the victims.

A police union official says a document identifying four suspects in the attacks in Spain's Catalonia region identify them as being of Moroccan origin and all from the small city of Ripoll near the Pyrenees mountains and Spain's border with France. The document--whose validity was confirmed by a Spanish police union official--identified the four as Moussa Oukabir, Said Aallaa, Mohamed Hychami and Younes Abouyaaqoub. It says Oukabir was born in Ripoll and also holds Moroccan citizenship. The document also says the other three were born in Morocco and have Spanish residency.

The official spoke anonymously because the official was not authorized to disclose the information .--By Alan Clendenning------9:20 p.m.. The leading newspaper in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region says beach towns are installing concrete barriers on popular pedestrian walkways to try to prevent the kind of attack that saw a van plow through tourists walking on a famed Barcelona promenade. La Vanguardia reported Friday that barriers were installed in the popular Mediterranean tourist destinations of Calafell, Calella and Reus. Strolls down Spanish streets and pedestrian-only areas filled with bars and restaurants are one of the country's biggest tourism draws. Those areas are typically packed with people during the summer, often until midnight or later. La Vanguardia's report had images of the barriers and of workers putting in place huge concrete flower pots in downtown Madrid as a precaution against van attacks. Thursday's van attack in Barcelona killed 13 people and injured 120, while a car attack early Friday in the seaside resort of Cambrils left one dead and five injured .------8:55 p.m..

The union official says Oukabir was one of four suspects for whom a court has issued warrants.

A French security official says Spanish police are looking for a Kangoo utility vehicle rented by suspects in the Barcelona attacks that may have crossed into France. The official said Spanish police alerted French authorities to the vehicle, rented Thursday in Spain. The official said French police nationwide are on the lookout for the car, and were given information from Spain about four suspects believed to be on the run. The official was not authorized to be publicly named speaking of an ongoing manhunt. After two deadly vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a nearby resort, France's interior minister said his country reinforced police surveillance Friday of what is normally an open border between Spain and France. French officials said Friday evening that no one has been detained so far in the Spanish investigation. The attacks Thursday and early Friday in Spain killed 14 people and wounded 126 others .------7:40 p.m. Riot police have dispersed a small group of far-right protesters after separating them from hundreds of counter-protesters near the site of a memorial to the Barcelona van attack victims. The far-right protesters, numbering 20-30, held up signs saying \"Stop Islamization of Europe.\" Counter-protesters were chanting \"tontos,\" or \"idiots\" at them, with some of them holding up their middle fingers at the far-right protesters. Riot police wearing helmets with face shields kept them apart for a while before gently removing the far-right protesters. After they walked away, the counter-protesters applauded and also left peacefully. The protest came a day after a van rammed into pedestrians in Barcelona's Las Ramblas district, killing 13 and injuring 120 .------7:30 p.m.. An official with a union for Spain's Civil Guard police force says a court has issued an order for the arrest of four suspects in connection with the attacks in Barcelona and a nearby seaside resort.

A French official also confirmed the document was circulating among law enforcement officials. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose the information. The document says one suspect was born in Spain and has Moroccan citizenship and the other three were Moroccans with Spanish residency. The list included Moussa Oukabir, who is believed to be a brother of one of those arrested for the attacks and possibly the Barcelona van driver.

Neighbors of the Oukabir family in the northern town of Ripoll say no one was home when the police arrived Friday morning. The door of the Oukabir's first-floor apartment was busted open. Spanish media have identified the van's suspected driver as 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir. His brother, Driss Oukabir, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, reportedly went to police in Ripoll to report that his documents were stolen. The mayor of Ripoll, Jordi Molle, says the documents were found in a vehicle used in the Barcelona attack. Ripoll, a 90-minute drive north of Barcelona, is a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 tucked into hilly Catalan heartland .---- 6 p.m. Rome will turn off the lights on the Colosseum to mourn those killed in the Barcelona attack. Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini says the lights on the ancient arena will go dark for a half hour Friday night. The ministry says the gesture is a \"sign of solidarity with the city of Barcelona and of mourning for the victims of the terror attack.\" On the broad boulevard outside the Colosseum are somber reminders of some of Italy's anti-attack security strategy. Near each end of the road, which is closed to most vehicular traffic, heavy vehicles guarded by soldiers or other security forces are positioned in such a way that city buses must slow to slalom around the obstacles .------5:45 p.m. Emergency authorities in Spain have provided an update on the numbers of casualties in the attacks in Barcelona and the seaside town of Cambrils. The Civil Protection agency says that 120 people were injured in the Barcelona attack, and six in Cambrils. It says that 61 people remain hospitalized, including 17 in critical condition and 25 in serious condition, after the Barcelona van attack.

The U.N. Security Council is strongly condemning the terrorist attack in Barcelona and paying tribute to the innocent victims. Egypt's U.N. Ambassador Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, the council president, began Friday's meeting on Yemen denouncing Thursday's deadly attack in Spain. He said: \"On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should like to condemn in the strongest terms the unconscionable terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, which targeted innocent civilians.\" Aboulatta said the Security Council sends its \"deepest condolences\" to the families. Many ambassadors and diplomats stood with their heads bowed in tribute .------4:40 p.m. Barcelona and Real Madrid have held a minute of silence for the victims of the attacks in Spain before their training sessions. Real Madrid players huddled Friday before beginning their activities at the team's training center in Madrid, while Barcelona's squad lined up in silence before its practice session at the team's headquarters. Barcelona team President Josep Bartomeu joined thousands at a minute of silence near where the driver of a van started an attack Thursday that killed at least 13 people and injured more than 100 others in Barcelona. There will be a minute of silence held before every Spanish league game this weekend, beginning with Friday's opening matches: Leganes vs. Alaves and Valencia vs. Las Palmas. Other soccer leagues across Europe have also planned acts to honor the victims of the attacks. The French league will hold a minute of silence before games .------4:30 p.m. Two memorials to the victims have grown on Barcelona's historic Las Ramblas promenade--one at the top near where the van jumped the curb, the other on the Joan Miro mosaic embedded in the pavement where it stopped. An ever-expanding jumble of flags, candles, teddy bears and flowers were placed at the base of the ornate Canaletes Fountain. \"We are not afraid! We are not afraid!\" onlookers chanted in Spanish. Jesus Borrull, a lifelong resident, gently pushed through the crowd to kneel and pray in front of the fountain. Legend has it that visitors who drink from the fountain will fall in love with Barcelona and return to the city. Borrull says \"the only thing we can do is go forward with peace and goodness...even though it's difficult, we have to do it.\" At the other memorial, bystanders held signs declaring they are not afraid. A guitar player strummed out \"Imagine\" by <mark>John Lennon</mark> while several people sang along .------4:20 p.m.. The State Department says at least one American was killed and one was injured in the terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, Spain.

The department did not identify either of the Americans, but said the injured person suffered only a minor wound .------4:15 p.m. Spanish authorities are still investigating whether a car that rammed a police checkpoint in the confused hours after the Barcelona van attack on Thursday was linked to the bloodshed in the city. Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said the driver of a Ford Focus rammed the control post and wounded a sergeant. Another officer shot at the car, which stopped, he said. Police found a dead body inside and first thought they had shot and killed the person, but forensic reports showed it was a knife wound. Trapero said a second person may have been in the car. He said it was unclear how or whether it was linked to the other attacks in Spain on Thursday and Friday .------4 p.m. Italy's premier has released the names of two Italians slain in the Barcelona van attack. Premier Gentiloni tweeted Friday that \"Italy remembers Bruno Gulotta and Luca Russo and gathers tight around their families. Freedom will conquer the barbarianism of terrorism.\" Gulotta, 35, was hailed in his hometown of Legnano as a hero for putting himself between the van and his 6-year-old son and 7-month-old daughter as he strolled with his wife Thursday in the Spanish city.

Fourteen people died and over 100 were injured in attacks Thursday and early Friday .------3:45 p.m. Police in Spain say that attacks in Barcelona, Cambrils had been prepared some time ago. Senior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said Friday police believe the two attacks were connected with an explosion in a house in the town of Alcanar on Wednesday in which one person was killed. Police believe one of the person injured in that blast and now arrested had links to the two attacks.

Thirteen people were killed in the attack in Barcelona on Thursday and one in the resort town Cambrils early Friday .------3:30 p.m. Turkey's president has condemned the van attack in Barcelona, Spain, in which 13 people were killed.

RFA Authorities in the southwestern Chinese region of Guangxi have detained outspoken rights attorney Tan Yongpei, whose license to practice was revoked last year. Tan was detained on Thursday by officers of the Nanning municipal police department during a raid on his Baijuying legal consultancy company. An employee at a company occupying the same floor told RFA: \"There were 10 or 20 of them. They came shortly after 5.00 p.m., just before we got off work.\" \"They showed their police identification and said they were from the police department and that they were looking for a lawyer surnamed Tan,\" he said. \"Then they went in.\" The employee said the officers were still on the premises when he left after 6.00 p.m. \"They were forceful, but went into their offices quite politely, with somebody shooting video,\" he said. \"They put seals on Tan's office door that said\" Nanning Municipal Police Department. \"The Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch website said the police hadn't produced any official documents authorizing the raid and search, however.

Halep, last year's runner-up, lost the first set before recovering to win 2-6 6-1 6-1 against American Alison Riske. Ukraine's fourth seed Elina Svitolina reached the third round with a 6-3 6-4 win over Slovakia's Viktoria Kuzmova.

Halep lost to unseeded Latvian Jelena Ostapenko in the Roland Garros final last year, one of six defeats in a showpiece over the past year. But reaching a second final in Paris looked a long way off as she made a woeful start in a match which originally supposed to be played on Tuesday. The 26-year-old Romanian hit 16 unforced errors in a opening set, but then won nine of the next 10 games to take control. Riske, who is Johanna Konta's doubles partner, stemmed the tide by claiming the fourth game of the final set, but only managed to win another 12 points in a final set which Halep won in 28 minutes.
