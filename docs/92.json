it's a life's hindrance. \"the women are working to try to change their lives for the better,\" says julia burkhead, program director at the shelter, which is operated by the nonprofit innvision and sleeps 27 women and their children. \"we want to give these women all the tools we can to help them move out and move up .\" computers are central to that goal. the out-of-date machines were donated to the shelter some years ago, burkhead says, but they were already a few years old and hampered by mysterious technical bugs that made working with them frustrating. there's a well-equipped computer lab across the street from the women's shelter at the georgia travis center, another innvision facility, but it's only available during the day. after 6 p.m., when mothers are home from jobs and kids are back from school, doing work that involves computers is impossible at the commercial street inn. workers there often tell the story of 10-year-old jake, son of one of the shelter mothers, who tried to use a decade-old imac to write a book report for school, only to discover that he could not print it. there were no printers. the computer was not connected to the internet, so the boy couldn't send the file elsewhere to print. <mark>ford</mark> can relate. she works two jobs when she's not at the shelter: one in accounting at a san jose information technology company and one as a part-time sales clerk at walmart. she's also taking online courses toward a bachelor's degree in business management, and tries to do her course work after putting her children to bed. arriving at the shelter with her children for the 6 p.m. curfew, <mark>ford</mark> sums up what she faces: \"i'm supposed to do my job search at night, but we don't have computers or internet access. you can't apply for jobs online. you can't print your resume. you can't check your e-mail to see if an employer has asked you to report for a job interview. when you don't have technology, you can't compete. you can't even look for bus routes!\" after 6 p.m., you're completely cut off from the world, \"she says .\" it's rough being cut off from the world. \"equipping the shelter with modern computing technology would help transform the lives of women at the shelter, burkhead said. they could learn critical skills in accounting, word processing, database management or online research. they could help their children do homework. and the commercial street inn could satisfy a requirement of calworks, a state back-to-work program for mothers, by helping shelter residents find work. innvision, the valley's largest nonprofit provider of shelter for homeless individuals and families, plans to turn the underused, dimly lit room into a proper computer lab. (for information about innvision, visit www.innvision.org .) the organization is asking for $13,000 to pay for a new docking station, printer, projector and four work stations loaded with software for educational and job-search use. it also hopes to buy tutorial software for clients who are learning english, as well as privacy and security devices to keep the hardware and software safe. wish book readers can help make the computer lab for homeless residents of the commercial street inn a reality. donations in increments of $100 will help fund the cost of the needed equipment. a few years ago, michele mims, 49, a recovering drug addict, was one of the homeless women staying at the shelter. with support from burkhead and belen garcia-aceves, the shelter's case manager, mims struggled to get back on her feet and find a job and her own place. because the computers at the shelter didn't work, mims rode the bus across town to the martin luther king jr. library in downtown san jose to search for jobs online after the georgia travis day center closed. today, mims, living in her own apartment, is general manager of the safeway at hamilton and meridian avenues in san jose. access to computers, she said, got her back on her feet .\" without computers, \"she says,\" women like me would not be able to get any farther than where i used to be: living on the streets and on drugs.

hartford, conn. - men's teams. women's teams. no. 89 belongs to uconn. it beats them all. the no. 1-ranked huskies women's basketball team topped the 88-game winning streak set by john wooden's ucla men's team from 1971-74, beating no. 22 florida state 93-62 on tuesday night. playing with the relentlessness that has become its trademark - and would have made wooden proud - connecticut blew past the seminoles as it has so many other teams in the last 2? years. maya moore had a double-double with a career-high 41 points and 10 rebounds and bria hartley added 21 points for the huskies, who have not lost since april 6, 2008, in the ncaa tournament semifinals. only twice during the record run has a team come within single digits of uconn - stanford in the ncaa championship game last season and baylor in early november. when the final buzzer sounded, uconn players sprinted across the floor to shake hands with the student section as fans held up signs with \"89\" and the huskies logo on them. a couple of other fans raised a banner that read \"the sorcerer of storrs .\" after a brief huddle in front of their bench, uconn players re-emerged wearing \"89 and counting\" t-shirts and bounced around at center court before posing for photos. \"i'm not john wooden and this isn't ucla,\" coach geno auriemma said. \"this is connecticut and that's good enough .\" it is one more chapter of history for uconn, and perhaps the grandest. connecticut long ago established itself as the marquee program in the women's game, the benchmark by which all others are measured. the huskies already own seven national titles and four perfect seasons under auriemma, and they've produced a galaxy of stars that includes rebecca lobo, diana taurasi, jennifer rizzotti, <mark>sue bird</mark> and <mark>tina charles</mark>. the streak, though, takes it to another level, certainly raising the profile of women's basketball and maybe all of women's athletics. two days after beating no. 11 ohio state to tie ucla, uconn toppled the mark in front of a sellout crowd of 16,294 at the xl center that included wooden's grandson, greg, attending his first women's game. \"my grandfather would have been thrilled. he would have been absolutely thrilled to see his streak broken by a women's basketball team,\" the 47-year-old wooden said. \"he thought, especially in the last 10 years, that the best basketball was played at the collegiate level - and it wasn't by the men .\" john wooden, the beloved wizard of westwood, died june 4 at age 99. there was a festive atmosphere throughout the city, where building lights gleamed blue and white, and it was as electric as any final four inside the arena. <mark>charles</mark> and uconn men's star kemba walker sat behind the huskies' bench, and football coach randy edsall was there, too. former nfl star warrick dunn, meanwhile, was cheering for his alma mater, florida state. with the game tied at 6, moore and uconn (11-0) took command. the senior all-american had seven points during a 15-2 run to give connecticut its first double-digit lead, and moore's fadeaway jumper from the baseline extended the advantage to 34-15. florida state (9-3) made a quick run to cut the lead to 11, but the huskies weren't about to let anyone spoil this night. uconn ripped off the next 16 points, capped by consecutive 3-pointers from freshman bria hartley and a pull-up by moore. auriemma gave hartley a kiss at the next timeout, and the tough-to-please coach was still grinning at halftime. \"she doesn't feel any of this,\" auriemma said as he left the court. \"she's kind of immune to all of this as a freshman. i love kids like that .\" uconn's rise to prominence began in 1995, when lobo led the huskies to their first national championship and unbeaten season. since then, the best players in the country have made their way to the rural campus in storrs, 30 miles outside of hartford. the excellence and confidence that defines great teams defines this one because auriemma won't have it any other way. perfection is expected, not simply a goal, and auriemma goes to extraordinary lengths to get it. he goads his players with criticisms of their games - sarcastic remarks that may strike outsiders as harsh but somehow trigger just the right response with gusto. he makes them play games of seven-on-five in practice. he rounds up bigger, stronger male students around campus to serve as practice players. he runs endless drills to hone skills the players thought they had mastered in junior high. it hardly seems to matter who is on the floor because uconn players don't wear names on the back of their uniforms. the only one that counts is the one on the front. when uconn - led by taurasi - won 70 straight games from 2001-03, a record in the women's game, it seemed unfathomable that it would be toppled, like ucla's 88. but what fans have learned over the years is that nothing this team does should be surprising. they have beaten 16 top-10 teams during the latest streak - four more than ucla did during its run - and five of those wins came against the no. 2 team. it's been more than 17 years since uconn lost consecutive games. \"we never talked about the streak,\" said <mark>charles</mark>, last season's national player of the year. \"we were playing for each other, what we did at practice, all the hard work we did, and just trying to do it on the court. there wasn't anything about the streak .\" the huskies have won by any average of more than 33 points during the streak and rarely found themselves in trouble. they have trailed for 134 minutes, including only 13 in the second half. they've won back-to-back national championships, and are now one short of tennessee's record for overall titles by a women's team. even before uconn tied ucla's record, the two programs were linked. auriemma acknowledges that his team runs the same offense that wooden perfected 37 years earlier. but it's not just the xs and os. the top block of wooden's pyramid of success reads: \"competitive greatness: perform at your best when your best is required. your best is required every day .\" that's been auriemma's mantra all along. greg wooden, who lives in california, said he came east because, \"i kind of thought that somebody should come here from the family and show support .\" he also was aware that \"certain players have said they're not really supportive of the streak .\" but he came knowing \"my grandfather would have loved to have been here to see this .\" the day notre dame broke ucla's streak, john wooden was asked how long it would be before somebody surpassed it. \"i have no idea how long it will be before somebody else wins that many. i know it takes at least three years,\" he replied. connecticut
