expert review says some of the dna evidence is unreliable knox appeals trial expert review says some of the dna evidence is unreliable by olga r. rodriguez associated press mexico city (ap) - dozens of plastic foam heads rain onto the stage. four drug traffickers in fringed jackets and sparkly pink cowboy hats bat them into the audience with toy ak-47s. all the while, the cast croons, \"let them slit our throats, let them pack us up...let them not ask any questions, let them not investigate .\" this is cabaret, mexico style. las reinas chulas, or the beautiful queens, parody drug violence in a show the women first produced in 2005 and that still fills nightclubs around mexico, including a performance in the tourist town of taxco this weekend. like other aspects of mexican society, violence now pervades the arts. from paintings to movies to opera, the killings and kidnappings that dominate headlines are now the topic du jour for artists trying to process what's happening to their country. many artists say they also hope their work helps to spark change in a society that seems to be growing numb to the daily bloodshed. dead bodies, blindfolded and hands tied, blot bucolic landscape paintings. pieces of a car window shattered in a shootout provide material for glittery bracelets that are part of an art installation. a famous narco-ballad about a female drug trafficker who kills her lover becomes an opera. \"art always tries to talk about where we are heading,\" said ana francis mor, a performer with las reinas chulas, who have been invited to perform in the u.s. and europe. \"it's a thermometer for society .\" even as the art flourishes, audience reaction and public support have been mixed, mirroring mexico's ambivalence about how to cope with the wave of violence that government figures show has so far taken at least 35,000 lives. other estimates peg the body count at around 40,000. \"every day we hear about the corruption, the killings, the impunity, and it feels like all of that is closer and closer to us, yet no one does anything, no one says anything\" said semiramis huerta, a cabaret actress in another show, \"the united narcos of mexico,\" which closes with corrupt police and drug traffickers dancing in a chorus line. mexican art has long reflected the country's violent history, from the murals of <mark>diego rivera</mark> and david siqueiros that dramatized the horrors of the mexican revolution to novels and narcocorridos detailing in word and song the entrails of the drug trade. narco themes have been showing up in visual arts for at least a decade, especially in states such as sinaloa, home to a powerful cartel of the same name, where violence long predated president felipe calderon's late 2006 crackdown on organized crime. but in the last two years, more exhibits have gone national and even international, and the sheer amount of such art has climbed. a movie, starkly titled \"hell,\" about a town overtaken by a drug lord who is also the mayor, swept the arieles, the mexican oscars, this year. a mexican art installation that reached the 2009 venice art biennial in italy includes a person mopping the bare floor with a mixture of water and blood. painter <mark>ricardo delgado</mark> herbert showed his portraits of monster-like hit men holding handguns or automatic rifles at an exhibit of latin american art in miami beach in march. the title of the collection, \"glorious pistols from a to the zetas,\" refers to the zetas drug cartel, which is notorious for its gruesome violence. now the 36-year-old artist from the city of tampico is working on a series of paintings depicting drug traffickers and soldiers as both saviors and executioners in the stations of the cross. it's his way of expressing how mexicans are trapped in the crossfire between two forces that are neither completely good nor completely bad, <mark>delgado</mark> herbert said. the artist grew up in the northeastern state of tamaulipas listening to corridos and watching low-budget movies about cowboy detectives who chase after narcos. he began painting the characters with crooked teeth and popped-out eyes in the aftermath of a 2004 shootout between soldiers and gunmen in matamoros, across from brownsville, texas. he said that's when he realized \"those characters i heard about growing up were among us and were confronting us .\" \"my work has been my constant complaint,\" he said. \"i paint what i don't like .\" a similar sense of disillusionment drives painter gilda lorena martinez, whose series, \"city of sand and blood,\" hung in the halls of the mexican congress in april. martinez has called ciudad juarez, mexico's most violent city, home for 20 years and she started putting her feelings on canvas in 2008, as murders in the city were soaring. she had to shut down her art school, moving it to her home, after a neighboring business received a bomb threat. one of her art students was killed outside his house. conversations about who was leaving the city or where mothers were sending their teenagers to study outside of town became common. in her series, ghostly figures with anguished faces are captured in beige and gray, the hues of the desert that surrounds ciudad juarez, accented with blood-red brush strokes. \"i was simply painting what i was feeling, as an outlet,\" she said, adding that for five months she became seriously ill from the stress of the insecurity surrounding her. \"it's my way of saying,\" look how fractured we are as a society .' \"while some artists say working with violent themes has helped them process how the lives of mexicans have changed, others have a more political message. they say they're chronicling the complexity of the country's security situation and how it's tied to the insatiable demand for drugs in the u.s. and other first-world countries. artist lenin marquez salazar, who was born and grew up in the sinaloan town of mocorito, paints the rich landscapes of his agricultural state, but with a macabre twist. into the pastoral frame, he adds bodies of blindfolded men with their hands and feet tied or wrapped in blankets, duplicating the daily images of drug trafficker victims .\" we forget we're a global society and that what happens somewhere else is affecting us here, \"said marquez salazar, 42, who has exhibited his work in the united states and colombia .\" i want to create awareness about this, not as a complaint, but as a way of expressing what i'm seeing. \"another sinaloan artist, teresa margolles, included the floor-mopping piece in her installation at the mexican pavilion of the 2009 venice art biennial. she collects artifacts from crime scenes, which are rarely secured in mexico, unlike in the u.s., such as pieces of glass or cloth dabbed with mud and blood. margolles, who's based in the sinaloa capital of culiacan and has long worked violent themes, created the art show to fulfill\" a social function of mourning, of marking the disappearance of a generation, \"said cuauhtemoc medina, who curated margolle's 2009 exhibit .\" theresa and i were guided by our disbelief that the 8,000 people killed nationwide by then didn't count, \"added medina, one of mexico's top art curators and critics .\" there is such a social blindness that they need 35,000 dead people to realize this is a total disaster. \"in some cases, artists have been asked to exhibit their work at government-run museums, only to have them blocked or edited for being too violent. medina said margolles' installation titled\" what else can we talk about? \"was supported by federal and private funds, but mexico's foreign relations department pulled out of the exhibit's organizing committee two weeks before the inauguration at the biennial. he said the government didn't want to be associated with the themes of the work. the foreign relations department didn't respond to a request for comment. in ciudad juarez, officials at the city's archaeology museum of the chamizal edited the name of martinez's series down to\" city of sand, \"eliminating the world\" blood, \"when it premiered in february. the reinas chulas have resisted softening their work, and the change in their audience's mood has been palpable as real-life violence has grown, said mor, one of the group's founding performers. the crowds used to laugh at the group's antics, which include political satire and outlandish costumes. now, many of the narco jokes elicit an awkward silence .\" in the last two years, the jokes began to take on a different meaning, \"mor said .\" some people do seem shocked, but in the end we all laugh, because what's happening hurts us too much. \"all content? copyright 2000 - 2011 worldnow and

Ocasio-Cortez clashed with Rep.

Picture: Supplied Politics Call for stricter vetting of political candidates by Mandy Squires 4th May 2019 7:55 AM premium_icon Subscriber only 0 POLITICAL parties need to overhaul candidate vetting systems to prevent ugly public rows and attract higher quality candidates, a former senior Labor adviser believes. Following the spectacular dumping of several Federal election candidates this week Steve Michelson - himself no stranger to controversy - has called for the bar to be set higher on background checks. Mr Michelson resigned as Bill Shorten's adviser in October 2017 after a decade-old photo taken at a fancy dress party resurfaced of him in blackface and wearing a curly, black wig. At the time he was seen as a rising star in the Labor party and a potential candidate for the sea of Isaacs. Former Bill Shorten Labor staffer Steve Michelson. Picture: Supplied He has described his decision to don the costume in 2007 as a \"regrettable mistake\". Mr Michelson, now 36 and a corporate adviser in Melbourne, yesterday told News Corp Australia the party vetting process was poor and undertaken too late in the selection process. In \"the new world order\" of social media and everlasting digital footprints, candidate backgrounds needed to be comprehensively checked to ensure there was nothing that could potentially surface down the track to embarrass the party and lead to disendorsement, or worse, legal action. \"What we've seen in this campaign is that political parties need to do more to vet their candidates and clearly need to do more to attract better quality candidates,\" he said. \"I think parties should be thinking about third-party character references and checks .\" He said \"freaks and geeks\" with extreme views were sometimes drawn to the minor parties and needed to be identified early and prevented from throwing their hats into the ring. His call for a tougher selection process comes after a horror week for the major parties as questionable social media posts - including those sharing racist, sexist and homophobic views - and past actions have come back to haunt several candidates. Labor candidate Luke Creasey has stepped down. Picture: Supplied But a former political adviser to several minor party leaders, who did not want to be named, said candidates were already thoroughly investigated before being endorsed, social media accounts checked and character references sought.

(AP)--A jury convicted an Arizona couple Friday of kidnapping and child abuse charges for imprisoning their three daughters, monitoring them through video feeds and forcing them to urinate and defecate in their closets. The jury found Fernando and Sophia Richter guilty on three counts each of kidnapping and child abuse. Fernando Richter was also convicted of two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The girls testified to having been physically abused, taken out of school and held captive for several months before the two younger girls escaped through a window in November 2013. Police rescued the oldest girl, who was held in a different room. They were 12, 13 and 17 at the time. The Associated Press does not generally name minors who authorities say are victims of crimes. All three testified in the trial that began over two weeks ago. They described months of abuse and bizarre rules imposed by their parents. The girls were forced to wake up at 2 a.m. every day to march in place, sometimes for so long that their legs ached, they said. They said they were fed rancid food and forced to overeat or face punishment. The youngest said Fernando Richter made her recite the dictionary at all hours and beat her if she mispronounced words. She described being moved around from bedroom to hallway to closet before her parents let her live in a room with her older sister. The oldest said she was not allowed to leave her bed, had to listen to a loud radio at all hours and hadn't seen her sisters in months when she was rescued. Authorities say the abuse began in a house in Catalina in nearby Pinal County, where the Richters face separate criminal charges. They pleaded not guilty in both cases. The defense said prosecutors didn't have enough evidence and that the girls were free to roam about the house. Sophia Richter testified in court on Tuesday that the girls were free to leave their rooms and were fed properly. She denied all of the accusations against her, including that she force fed the girls a rancid pasta-type meal. \"They had fruit daily, they had snacks daily. They were never without. I always had fruit for them,\" she said. The Richters moved to a Tucson house about four months before the girls escaped. Police officers who testified described a house that smelled so bad of urine and feces they had to open all the windows to conduct their investigation. The girls said they were rarely allowed bathroom breaks, forcing them to urinate and defecate in their bedroom closets. The oldest sister described the plastic water jugs they were given as moldy and the meals they were fed twice a day as rancid. \"It was nasty. Gagging nasty,\" she testified. \"We would have to lick our plates if we wanted them clean and if not my mom would just throw more food on it if I didn't lick it .\" Share this: Share on Facebook

"date": "2012-10-30", "url": "http://salon.com/2012/10/30/obama_last_of_the_new_democrats/", "content": "\"i am a new democrat,\" barack obama told the new democrat coalition back in march 2009. whether he wins a second term or is defeated, the first black president of the united states may be not only the second but also the last of the new democrats in the white house. between the 1980s and the present, the so-called \"new democrats\" have existed in two distinct forms. in the early 1980s, the democratic leadership council (dlc) was formed, chiefly by white southern and western democratic politicians, with the goal of winning back \"reagan democrats\" - white working class members of the dying roosevelt coalition, who combined support for universal social programs like social security and medicare with hawkish military attitudes and socially conservative values on attitudes like abortion, censorship and gay rights. early in its history, the dlc proposed a program of educational and other benefits for young americans in return for national military or civilian service, along the lines of the g.i. bill. the original new democrats were hard to distinguish from southern and western \"blue dog\" democrats (\"blue dog\" is a play on the term \"yellow dog democrat\" for someone who would vote for a \"yellow dog\" as long as it was a democrat). al from, the founder of the dlc and its leader until 2009, had been a staffer for willis long, a democratic representative from louisiana. among the presidents of the dlc were al gore, senator from tennessee, and bill clinton, governor of arkansas. but in the 1990s a combination of events shifted the center of gravity of the new democrat movement from the south and west to the northeast. after the new democrats succeeded in electing one of their own, bill clinton, to the white house in 1992, the 1992 mid-term elections not only gave republicans control of the house and senate but wiped out democrats in the south and west. after 1994, the democrats were much more dominated by urban areas, minorities, and white social liberals. meanwhile, the end of the cold war combined with republican victories in the federally-funded military-industrial \"gun belt\" of the southern periphery eliminated a traditional base of support in the democratic party. the center of gravity of the new democrats shifted from the former confederacy to wall street. the original new democrats had been symbolized by sam nunn, the conservative democratic senator from georgia, chairman of the senate committee on armed services. the second-wave new democrats of the 1990s were symbolized by robert rubin, the new york financier and democratic fund-raiser who became bill clinton's secretary of the treasury and pushed an agenda of international financial liberalization and financial deregulation. during the two terms of george w. bush, the evolving new democrat or \"neoliberal\" movement was dominated by socially-liberal economic conservatives in wall street and silicon valley. these centrist democrats jettisoned the white working class southerners and westerners who had been wooed by the original new democrats, and focused instead on winning over former moderate republicans in the northeast and west coast who combined liberal attitudes on abortion, gay rights and environmentalism with opposition to \"big government\" and concern about federal deficits. in 2008, many wall street democratic donors abandoned hilary clinton and supported a relatively unknown first-term senator from illinois, barack obama. in his first term, obama has governed as an \"eisenhower democrat .\" he combined a foreign policy realism reminiscent of republican realists like eisenhower, brent scowcroft and <mark>colin powell</mark> (who voted for him in 2008 and endorsed him in 2012). in domestic policy, his major success has been the affordable care act or obamacare, which was based on the \"individual mandate\" system promoted in the 1990s by the moderate republican senator lincoln chafee of rhode island and adopted by \"romneycare\" in massachusetts. to the dismay of progressive and populist democrats, obama refused to support radical reform of the financial sector which had largely funded his campaign in 2008 and surrounded himself with wall street insiders like timothy geithner and william daley. as presidents, bill clinton and barack obama have both reflected the priorities of the second new democrat coalition, uniting donors from wall street, hollywood and silicon valley with a \"new majority\" coalition of racial minorities, immigrants, liberal women and young voters. because democratic voters are disproportionately poor, this has produced a democratic party which, in economic terms, is an hourglass coalition of the top and the bottom. economic populism frightens the party's billionaire donors, while social populism, which has often been associated with white working class xenophobia, racism and religiosity, frightens blacks, latinos, immigrants and white social liberals. the result is what mike konczal and others have called \"pity-charity\" liberalism-a kind of liberalism which appeals to the sympathy of the rich for the poor, rather than appealing, as the new deal did, to solidarity among the middling majority. it was a version of progressivism ill-suited to the great recession, which demanded the visionary leadership of a franklin roosevelt, not the managerial competence of a nelson rockefeller. the most recent version of the new democrat project may be doomed, even if the self-described new democrat barack obama is elected to a second term. in 2012, most wall street donors, offended by obama's mild criticism and alarmed by the support shown by many democrats for occupy wall street, have swung their support away from the democrats to the republicans. it is unlikely that most of them will ever come back. in the aftermath of the great recession, moderate as well as progressive democrats are going to emphasize deficit reduction through tax increases far more than even moderate republicans. the easiest way to raise lots of revenue is to raise today's low rates on capital gains, perhaps even making the capital gains and income tax rates equal. any such reform will cut deeply into the incomes of many wall street rentiers whose \"progressivism\" extends only to cost-free support for gay rights and abortion rights. at the same time, the moderate conservative economic agenda adopted by clinton and obama, like the more extreme conservative agenda that democratic neoliberalism copies and dilutes, has failed to slow the growth of inequality or stop the long-term erosion of the american middle class. in the 1990s, new democrats like clinton argued that americans should embrace free trade and become \"knowledge workers\" to flourish in a win-win global economy. by 2012, such optimistic rhetoric rang hollow. most of the jobs being created in the u.s. are low-wage jobs that require only high school diplomas. and in this year's election, obama and romney have competed to denounce chinese state capitalism and mercantilism, instead of indulging in happy talk about the wonders of globalization. the first-wave new democrats sought the votes of white working class reagan democrats. the second-wave new democrats abandoned the reagan democrats and sought to convert former moderate republicans in the northeast, midwest and west coast. but if obama wins re-election, it may be because of democratic partisanship among latino voters. if the democrats depend increasingly on the latino vote, then new democrat policies may be politically irrelevant, if not harmful. in many ways latino voters are more like the white working class reagan democrats than like the white rockefeller or eisenhower republicans whom democrats have persuaded to switch parties in recent years. it is easy to imagine the growing latino population supporting affirmative government to help the working class and middle class, as the heavily-working-class \"white ethnics\" of the industrial cities did in the mid-twentieth century. and industrial policy like obama's gm bail-out is likely to appeal to latino working families as well as to working-class whites. in contrast, the clinton-obama synthesis of free-market conservatism with the identity politics of the cultural left is less likely to resonate with these new voters. symbolizing the end of an era, the democratic leadership council closed its doors in 2011. the democratic party will continue to evolve, reflecting demographic and cultural and economic shifts. but this year's election may be the last in which the democratic nominee for the presidency calls himself a \"new democrat .\" romney surrogate deceptive about roe how elizabeth warren saved taxpayers $1 billion mitt flips on fema, now would keep it chris christie: \"i don't give a damn

friday, july 22, 2011 in a speech made by president woodrow wilson on april 2, 1917 he argued the reasons for declaring war against germany. of all that he said the one line most remembered and most often quoted has been, \"no one minds being labeled a naysayer or a prophet of doom if he or she is charged by the love of country, driven by the inspiration of god and fully guided by the biblical and historical record that assures us that any nation that forgets god, is dooming itself, the voices of her prophets notwithstanding. the short version goes like this\" the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget god. \"(psalm 9: 17) in america it can no longer be said that we have forgotten god, but it would be far more accurate to say we are now fighting against god. efforts to remove allusions to god from our public buildings, classrooms, cemeteries and military installations are only part of our futile warfare. on the other side of the coin come the armies of darkness under the banner of political correctness, tolerance, diversity and civil rights covered under the first amendment of the constitution. the nation is distracted by economic woes and thus has all but put moral issues on the back burner. it is this very pot on the back burner that is about to ignite and burn our lovely little house to the ground. someone with only a scant knowledge of our history who visited or moved to this country today, might conclude that now we are using all the best of our constitutional principles to make our democracy safe for perversion. it all looks and sounds so very american but it is the battle plan of fools being guided by the spirit of antichrist. it will progress to its predicted fulfillment and it will for a moment in time look like a victory but the win is short lived. at its peak it will not last more than a mere seven years. shortly after giving my life over to god in a powerful conversion experience i decided to go see a <mark>john huston</mark> film released in 1966 called\" the bible. \"it is a film that shows the events of the bible in a panoramic fashion, going from creation to moses leading the children of israel to their promised land. one scene in the film stunned me and i thought <mark>huston</mark> had overdone the effect a bit too much. in a scene where the sodomites (homosexuals) surrounded the house of lot they were clamoring to come in or have lot send out the men in the house so they could have sex with them. (gen 19: 5) in <mark>huston</mark>'s flick the homosexuals were all dressed in carnival garb and some were not dressed at all. they were covered with body markings, tattoos and the strangest hair styles and colors i had ever seen. they had body jewelry and piercings from head to toe. they were openly making a show of sex and groping that looked like a mix of an orgy and a salvador dali painting. at the time it seemed extreme to me, but today i have seen worse, and unless you live deep in middle america and don't search the news too exhaustively you probably still think it's extreme. if, however, you have searched the internet, or been to a southern decadence celebration in new orleans or a gay pride parade in san diego you know that <mark>john huston</mark> must have been a visionary. it may not be a vision we are happy to know about, but it was in many ways not nearly enough to describe what is going on in our nation today. to say we are in the throes of a moral decline is an expression that is woefully inadequate to describe the nature of our fall. it is an ecclesiastical, theological, philosophical and ideological apostasy, which can only be described as, pervasive and degenerative. extreme you say? if hollywood can't catch up to our reality, there is no place for the word, extreme. the perversion is not limited to sexual preference but it is like the kudzu of the deep south which overnight crawls upon every object in its path and hangs there to promote its own life at the expenses of everything it smothers. it isn't enough to have hate laws passed and to flaunt our license parading it as constitutionally provided freedom. now we must liken, or equate the whole gay movement, with the civil rights movement of the early sixties, another obvious perversity. such perversion is not limited to the gay agenda but can be seen in the excesses of political correctness in every area of our ever morphing social upheaval. we cringe at the pictures of hooded kkk clansmen hiding themselves and their hatred behind whitewashed linen with small holes cut in the masks to allow the wearers to peer out at the activities and actions of others of like mind. but now we see millions of supporters marching, arguing and defending the palestinian movement. secret soldiers (or cowards) also draped with white masks, green bands and slits to allow them to see the activities of their peers. both groups emboldened with hate, both hiding behind whitewashed cloth, and yet we stand for one, and decry the other. we talk of al qaeda as if this wounded group of extremists is alone the cause of all turmoil caused in the west, but battalions of parading hamas and hezbollah, accompanied on all sides by throngs of raving supporters are perfectly tolerable. this is perversion. this according to the voices of the new politically corrected and ideologically re-born, is a'?? hate group we can live with .' for the sake of that elusive'?? world peace' we can tolerate muslim rage and hatred. in america the perversion exists because we not only have turned against the clear warnings of god's word concerning the sin of homosexuality (romans 1: 1f) but we have chosen to move from ignoring that word, and those who stand by it, to isolating them and putting them down for their position. it is the wholesale penchant to allow anything by constitution, which is breaking the bond between us and our god and protector. same sex marriage, the 155,000 attendants and supporters of the 37 th annual gay pride parade in san diego and now the passing of california's sb48 which requires schools to teach gay history, are symptoms of a deepening national decline. it is born of political correctness that speaks to an almost total moral perversion of the national psyche. it is no longer just ignoring one or two biblical moral mandates it is the wound that is becoming gangrenous. california's sb48 is a direct attack on the innocence and future of children that in days of old would be equivalent to child abuse, but in the diversity movement of the day, it is heralded as a social achievement to be bragged about. it is in fact one of the most serious steps yet, in bringing god's wrath to our nation. what prophecy or scriptural passage assures me of this? it is clear as a bell and i urge you to read it very carefully .\" but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. \"(mt 18: 6) christians say little about the moral decline and when they do it seems they are a dollar short and a day late. they are taken up with theological arguments about the timing of the rapture, petty theological differences and the quest for the mega church that beats all others before it. now some have started whole ministries to argue the possibility that the antichrist may be a muslim. while they are straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel they fly by the obvious such as the fact that if the antichrist were a muslim he would be rejected out of hand by muslims around the world when he casts off all gods including the god of his fathers and makes himself to be god according to daniel 11: 37. the same verse also seems to indicate that he may after all, be gay. while the bickering and general sleepiness persists among the believers the nation is going to hell in the proverbial hand basket. a few faithful voices can still be heard and revival stirrings can be heard among the ranks of the faithful as well. for the rest of the nation it is clear that god is about to set down a mark or as we say in the common language, draw a line. it is when god sees that we have passed beyond the mark he has set for us. he has been patient and longsuffering but his patience has limitations .\" if thou, lord, shouldest mark iniquities, o lord, who shall stand? \"(psalm 130: 3) from the senate hearings led by al franken to determine a means to repeal the defense of marriage act to the debauch on the streets of our cities our nation is satisfied to watch its better days slip into the dark cloud of collective reprobation. no one cringes anymore when the dog returns to its vomit. (pr 26: 11) our youth are advantaging each other in hot sexual pursuit like so many dogs in heat all the while no one seems to remember that even the wild beasts of the pack, the pride and the herd have enough cognizance of the voice of mother nature to leave those of their own gender to themselves. spoiled by years of complacence, past glories and victories we have slid along the smooth way in opulence and the lack of nothing, to the place where the mind can create its own world of unfathomed, howbeit, feigned freedoms. all this is done in the name of the revered document our founders provided for us to end subservience and tyranny and declared to be the very constitution of these united states of america. the sharpest minds have declared with no uncertainty that the bible is an antiquated book of platitudes, poetry and fables for the very young or the very old. we cannot see like the criminal who sells his future for a single moment of greed or passion that we will one day long for the days of our freedom. wisdom born of pride and nurtured by delayed recompense is thoroughly blinded to the fact that the scaled down wisdom of man is the key to the door marked, perdition. to wit:\" professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. \"(ro 1: 22) god has allowed man to accomplish almost anything he can imagine but a single man is doomed to failure if he wavers. how can we believe that if we, as a nation waver from the course set for us by our founders, that we will continue in god's favor and unending success?\" '?? for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord. \"(james 1: 6, 7) those who hold to the scriptures are not na?? ve. we know that homosexuals have been among us since the dawn of time. while most nations don't see a rise in homosexuals until a kingdom or nation is about to fall, there is one big difference in the gay agenda today that has never existed at any other time in history. today the gays are seeking and to some degree getting the protection of the law. wickedness without the law or under the protection of the law is still wickedness. the strength of the law is to aid the doer of wickedness in burying or searing the conscience. paul said\" now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron. \"(1tim 4: 1, 2) the law, combined with a scarred and insensitive conscience, has been engaged to allow the behaviors of men and women in the last days to go off the charts and is a prophetic surety. it is happening now, but it has an end. when all the props are removed whether social acceptance or the law, in the blaring light of the return of the lord jesus christ, what's left of conscience will be seen sending them scrambling for places to hide. even the little conscience left to them, will be sufficient to make them realize that; the jig is up. speaking of conditions at the very moment christ appears in the eastern skies and begins his descent to the earth, the apostle <mark>john</mark> describes the reactions of those who remain on earth and have not responded, repented or reacted with anything other than defiance. here is the picture of those conditions. you do not see any pompous presidents, slick legislators or politicians, puffed up educators, or gay parades in this scenario .\" and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb: rev michael bresciani is a christian author and a columnist for several online conservative and christian news and commentary sites. his website is the website for insight covers current events, politics, christianity, movie and book reports and much more. pursuant to title 17 u.s.c. 107, other copyrighted work is provided for educational purposes, research, critical comment, or debate without profit or payment. if you wish to use copyrighted material from this site for your own purposes beyond the \"fair use' exception, you must obtain permission from the copyright owner."}, {"articleID": "2010022210_00152381_W", "names": {"Gordon Brown": ["Q10648", "Q1537981", "Q18763895", "Q20979218", "Q3110844", "Q5584912", "Q5584914", "Q5584916", "Q5584919", "Q5584920", "Q5584921", "Q57428588", "Q59312133"]}, "date": "2010-02-22", "url": "http://guardian-series.co.uk/uk_national_news/5020686.Patron_quits_in_Brown_bullying_row/?ref=rss", "content": "patron quits in <mark>brown</mark> bullying row (from east london and west essex guardian series) a charity at the centre of the <mark>gordon brown</mark> bullying row has been dealt a blow after one of its patrons resigned - accusing its boss of breaching confidentiality. professor cary cooper, a celebrated expert on workplace stress, said he had sent an email to christine pratt in the previous hour telling her he was resigning as a patron of the national bullying helpline. he said: \"i am resigning now on the grounds that i think she breached confidentiality .\" one of the things that is really important for any helpline or any counselling service is to retain confidentiality of the people calling up. \"pm <mark>gordon brown</mark> faces allegations that he bullied staff an anti-bullying charity boss said its helpline had received calls from downing street need a change?

Bell set his mark in 1984-85 with the Nordiques. Nazem Kadri and MacKinnon scored 1:54 apart as the Avalanche were propelled by another second-period spurt. They also pulled away from the defending Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues with a middle-period flurry over the weekend. Leading 2-1 early in the third, Kadri helped Colorado put the game out of reach when he and Matt Nieto scored within 53 seconds of each other. <mark>Ryan Graves</mark> added another goal late in the third and MacKinnon knocked in an empty-netter for his 30th. The win allowed the Avalanche to finish their homestand with a 3-0-2 mark. They won't play again until Feb. 1 due to the All-Star break and a bye week. Pavel Francouz stopped 22 shots for Colorado. Tyler Bertuzzi, Dylan Larkin and Givani Smith scored for Detroit, which has dropped five in a row (0-4-1). Larkin also had two assists. Jimmy Howard made 40 saves in falling to 2-18-2. \"We wouldn't have been in the game if he hadn't played as well as he played, so he was excellent,\" Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. \"He's been really good the last three games. He looks like he's on top of his game .\" The Avalanche had 10 players with at least a point. \"The story about our team this year is having that depth, having other guys step up on any given night,\" said Kadri, who also had an assist. \"That \u00b4 s what makes us such a hard team to play against .\" It was a penalty-marred opening period, with both teams drawing double-minor, high-sticking calls. Colorado's power play extended into the second period and Kadri scored the tying goal when he tipped in a shot from Makar. Makar then assisted on MacKinnon's goal by skating around before sending a pass down low to a wide open MacKinnon. The lone first-period score was turned in by Bertuzzi, who knocked in his team-leading 17th of the season 2:28 into the game. He instantly drew boos from the crowd. He was booed throughout the afternoon. It wasn't Bertuzzi nearly as much as his last name. On March 8, 2004, his uncle, Todd Bertuzzi, then playing for the Vancouver Canucks, hit former Colorado forward <mark>Steve Moore</mark> from behind. <mark>Moore</mark> crashed face first to the ice, leaving him with a concussion and fractured vertebrae. A settlement was eventually reached in <mark>Moore</mark>'s lawsuit against Todd Bertuzzi. \"He loves his uncle and that stuff doesn't bother him a bit,\" Blashill said. Avalanche coach Jared Bednar can sympathize with Blashill, whose team is in the midst of a 12-34-4 (28 points) season. Bednar and his squad went a through an equally trying 22-56-4 (48 points) campaign in 2016-17. \"It's horrible. It's pure misery,\" Bednar explained to reporters after practice Sunday. \"You feel your effort is good and you're trying to do your best and you just can't get it done .\" The Red Wings can take solace in watching Colorado, a team that's made it to the postseason the past two seasons. \"I remember three years ago coming in here playing against these guys, they didn't look like they wanted to play,\" Larkin said. \"Look at what they've done with their top line and Makar is one heck of a player .\" I find these guys right now a real team, and they're contenders and the most dynamic team we've played against. \"NOTES: Red Wings F Frans Nielsen and D <mark>Mike Green</mark> both suffered upper-body injuries ....Avalanche F Joonas Donskoi (concussion protocol) missed a fifth straight game. He went through practice Sunday and could be back after the break ....Kadri recorded his fourth multi-goal game this season. UP NEXT Red Wings: Play in Minnesota on Wednesday. Avalanche: Off until Feb. 1 when they play in Philadelphia. ___"}]
