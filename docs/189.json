what it's made of his jumper with 32.4 seconds left gave the clippers a 91-86 lead that sealed the victory and pushed their winning streak to four games. his two free throws with 8.9 seconds left for the final margin precipitated an \"mvp\" chant from fans. vinny del negro said. \"he's a competitor, he wanted to be out there. we definitely needed him tonight .\" three-point shooting kept the wizards in the game and gave the clippers plenty of trouble. washington was eight for 20 from three-point range; the clippers were only five for 21. bradley beal made a three-pointer with 2:43 left, it pulled washington within 85-83. from that point, the clippers were in a game. <mark>john wall</mark>, who had 24 points in his fifth game since returning from a leg injury, made one of two free throws to make it 85-84. blake griffin (17 points, 11 rebounds) made two free throws for an 87-84 lead, but then fouled nene as the wizards center scored on a driving layup. but nene missed the free throw, leaving the clippers ahead, 87-86, lead with 1:33 left. after <mark>paul</mark> missed a shot, griffin got the offensive rebound and scored off a pass from <mark>paul</mark> for an 89-86 lead. <mark>wall</mark> then committed a turnover, opening the door for <mark>paul</mark> to deliver the game to the clippers. \"washington is getting some of their players back, and they are playing well,\" del negro said of the wizards, who are 8-30 but had won four of five games before saturday, including victories over oklahoma city and denver. \"i knew this was going to be a tough game .\" so the clippers had been warned not to take washington lightly. but it wasn't until late in the second quarter that they were able to get some separation from the wizards. chauncey billups has been making progress in his recovery from tendinitis in his left foot. but the coach said there still isn't a timetable for billups to return. del negro said billups will start playing in three-on-three workouts. billups has continued to get therapy. \"he said it's feeling a lot better,\" del negro said...there already has been chatter that plenty of teams are interested in acquiring eric bledsoe in a trade. the clippers aren't shopping their young point guard, but that hasn't stopped the rumors from flying or stopped scouts and personnel executives from asking to see if bledsoe is available. the

is a member of the motley fool blog network--entries represent the personal opinions of our bloggers and are not formally edited. at the moment, the retail value of u.s. coffee market is a staggering $30-32 billion. with 20,366 stores in 61 countries, the american coffee giant,. given the fact that the restaurant industry isn't on a rise, what should we expect from starbucks in 2013? one dollar reusable cups starbucks is about to offer its customers $1 reusable plastic cups. according to the company, the customers would be served in the same cups (cups would be cleaned with boiling water) each time they bring them back. these cups were tested in 600 stores in the u.s. and would be introduced soon in the whole north american region. this comes as a part of? company's goal of serving 5% of all drinks in reusable cups by 2015. currently, starbucks is earning a gross margin of 11% on its sales, but with more competitors making inroads in the coffee market, the margins are bound to get smaller in the future. therefore, decreasing costs in the long run is of foremost importance to the company. most expensed restaurants in the u.s. when it comes to consumers' choice for coffee, starbucks still remains one of the favorite spots in the u.s., but the competitors are gradually bridging the gap. according to a travel and expense company, starbucks is one the favorite spots for employees when it comes to business travel. on average, employees expensed around 21,000 transactions at the company, with a bill of $7.54. the hamburger giant, mcdonald's grabs the second spot with 12,420 transactions and an average bill amounting to $6.73. while subway recorded a total of 8627 transactions, it had an average bill of $11.88 .? during the past few months, the lawmakers in the u.k. have severely criticized? starbucks for avoiding taxes in the country. as a result, the company has finally announced that it would pay taxes in excess of 10 million pounds in each of the next two years. starbucks has more than 700 stores in the u.k. and has been operating in the region for the last 14 years, yet it has paid only 8.6 million pounds in taxes. according to the company, it hasn't done anything illegal, as a foreign company doing business in europe is allowed to base itself anywhere in the 27 eu nations. the company has been paying royalties in netherlands, where it has established its headquarters. the matter of fact is that these new tax regulations in the u.k. will have a major effect on starbucks' cash flows. starbucks is earning a healthy 29% on its equity, plus a payout ratio of 47% depicts that the company is keen on returning money back to its shareholders. with far less cash on hand in 2013, it won't be easy for the company to grow its dividends like it did before (in 2012, company's dividends grew by 24%). starbucks is currently trading at a forward p/e (1yr) of 20.92 x and is yielding a dividend of 1.50% on its stock. though the industry's p/e is 30.62 x at the moment, starbucks should sell at a 5% discount to industry's p/e amid higher taxes in the u.k. according to the consensus estimates, starbucks should be selling at $62.80; hence, it has an upside potential of 14.6%. moreover, the mean target price from the sell side is $60.32, which means it's undervalued by 10%. mcdonald's starbucks' biggest competitor, mcdonald's, have started selling bags of ground coffee at its restaurants in canada. at the moment, its ground coffee is available at canada's 1400 stores. according to the company, if the coffee does well, it could spread throughout the world. mcdonald's has a habit of trying its new products in a specific region, before making it a worldwide product. same was the case with mccafe coffees, which were first launched in australia before being introduced in the u.s and europe. for the last couple of years, mcdonald's coffee has played a pivotal role in driving its revenues. as <mark>john betts</mark>, president of mcdonald's canada says \"if you want to be a credible player in the restaurant industry, you have to have a great cup of coffee .\" you can have a look at my detailed take on mcdonald's here. more and more retail food unders? tand the fact that coffees are an essential part of their business, which have a large room to grow in the future. as a result, starbucks is not only facing tough competition from mcdonald's, but also from the likes of burger king and wendy's. the recent addition of coffee frappes in burger king's menu has shown a lot of promise. moreover, wendy's have also started to test its specialty coffee in select markets. dunkin' brands group starbucks' second biggest competitor in the u.s. is dunkin' brands. at the moment, the company has more than 7,200 restaurants in the country. moreover, the company has plans of opening 15,000 restaurants in the u.s. in the next 20 years. the company has a long term goal of having more than 1000 restaurants in california. as part of this plan, the company has initially decided to open a series of restaurants in southern california. according to the company, it would also be opening chains in airports, casinos, military bases, universities and super markets. last year, the company opened 291 restaurants in the u.s and in 2013, the company plans on opening a further 350 restaurants. with a catchy tagline, \"america runs on dunkin,\" the company has been putting more emphasis on its coffee in the last few months. moreover, the company is marketing itself as a far less expensive brand than starbucks. dunkin's ceo, nigel travis said that the company would also increase its drive-thrus in california, as it can have a major effect on company's revenues. the company has already expanded itself in western states like nevada, arizona and colorado. vamosrafa7 has no position in any stocks mentioned. the motley fool recommends mcdonald's and starbucks. the motley fool owns shares of mcdonald's and starbucks. try any

anymore,\" timbuktu native says an offensive led by french troops is aimed at flushing out the militants bamako, mali (cnn)--there's no shortage of harrowing details on life under islamist militants in northern mali. public floggings for smoking a cigarette. brutal beatings for working as a radio journalist. broken hearts, broken limbs. \"for the islamists, a human being is like an ant you squash, like an animal you slaughter,\" said sedou sangare, a resident of the northern town of gao. gao was once a vibrant community filled with colorful camel caravans lazily strolling down the streets. bearded men and beaded women mingled freely. mali forces push back islamic militants is al qaeda close to calling mali home? france beefs up troop number in mali unrest, tension continue in mali malian govt. regains control of diabaly in mali, echoes of libyan intervention then the islamists rode in on rundown pickup trucks, armed to the teeth. they banned smoking, television, sports and music--a major setback for the northern region known for its \"festival au desert .\" they forbade unwed men and women from mixing in public. \"everybody panicked' though gao has a majority muslim population, most residents practice a more relaxed form of the religion. after militants started imposing a stricter form of islamic law, or sharia, throngs took to the streets in protest .\" when they declared sharia, everybody panicked, \"sangare said .\" christians, muslims, everybody fled. \"but the protests did not deter the militants, who publicly punished anyone who defied their teachings. in august last year, they forced a couple allegedly having an affair into two holes and stoned them to death as terrified residents quietly watched. lists of public and cruel punishments grew. floggings, executions, amputations--all in full view of aghast residents. the islamists compiled a list of unmarried mothers, saying sharia law condemns relationships outside marriage. a mayor--and his people--displaced mayor sadou diallo misses residents of his desert town of gao, most of whom fled to bamako when militants took over. about 229,000 malians have been displaced--mainly from kidal, timbuktu, and gao, according to the united nations. he is one of the displaced. a former respected community leader, trying to rebuild, just like his people. residents of the north, once proud of the vibrant desert communities near river niger, say the region is a shadow of what it used to be .\" home is not sweet anymore, \"said fadimata alainchar, a charity worker and native of nearby timbuktu. a recent visit to her hometown left her shaken .\" when entering the city, the signboard which was: \"welcome to timbuktu the city of 333 saints\" is now \"welcome to timbuktu, the gate to the application of the shariya,\" she said in a submission to cnn's ireport. the fabled city includes ancient tombs and wooden structures dating to the 15th century, a major part of its cultural heritage. and those are not the only changes. women who don't cover their bodies in accordance to the militants' sharia law, are imprisoned or raped, she said. their husbands, terrified of killings and amputations, don't utter a word. and gunshots are a common sound. \"if not to disperse women marching, it is to kill dogs that are barking and preventing the insurgents from sleeping,\" alainchar said. \"home has changed. before it was peace, joy and love. now it is shame, terror and abuse .\" \"i prefer dying\" stories of cruel punishments abound. radio journalist malik maiga faced the militants' wrath when he used his show to warn residents of public stoning or floggings. islamists singled him out, beat him up and left him in a cemetery. he survived and is among the displaced in bamako. maiga is not the only journalist targeted. last week, another radio journalist was killed, leading gao residents to retaliate by killing a militant leader. then there's suleyman and muktar, former truck drivers, accused of stealing. their limbs were hacked off. they are jobless and wander around the capital. \"i prefer dying to being like this,\" muktar said. \"my hand hurts, my heart aches. i only have god to ask for help .\" mali descended into chaos last year, when junior military members seized power in a coup. outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum after the coup and seized some parts of the north. a power struggle erupted between the rebels and local islamists, leading the latter to topple the tribe and seize control of two-thirds of northern mali, an area the size of france. hope amid chaos the crisis in the north has prompted fears that the al qaeda-linked extremists will set up shop there. it is \"a serious, ongoing threat,\" u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton warned wednesday. an offensive led by french and malian troops is aiming to stop the militants from using the vast desert area as a training ground for international attacks. \"we are in for a struggle. we cannot permit northern mali to become a safe haven\" for terrorists, clinton said. international troops from west african nations such as nigeria are joining the effort to restore some normalcy to the north. amid the strife and despair, citizens of the former french colony remain hopeful. and as french combat helicopters fly overhead, crowds below erupt into cheers. but in northern mali, at least for now, there is little to smile about. cnn's nima elbagir reported from bamako, mali, and faith karimi wrote from atlanta. cnn's <mark>sarah brown</mark> also contributed to this report", "articleID": "2013012410_00021460_W",

when 500,000 people showed up in washington to speak out for the unborn, it was barely a footnote. abc, cbs, and nbc devoted close to two-and-a-half hours (147 minutes and 43 seconds) to the te'o

reported a net loss of $453.9 million, or $3.45 per share, for the three months ended december 31, its third fiscal quarter. that compared with net income of $28.1 million, or 20 cents per share, in

management contracts and uncertainties such as its ongoing search for a new chief executive. assets under management fell to $648.9 billion from $650.7 billion at september 30. the decline was due to
