Headquarters: Troy? Founded: 1959? Employees: 100 corporate employees; independent franchisees own and operate all but 12 of 400 Ziebart locations worldwide? Famous slogan: \"It's us or rust\" ? Main products and services Folks at Ziebart International headquarters in Troy, like most Michigan residents, don't enjoy dodging potholes or flying road debris in the aftermath of the state's harshest winter in memory. But if you want to protect your car or truck from salt pellets and crumbling chunks of pavement, Ziebart would love to help. In fact, the 55-year-old Ziebart franchising firm just happens to be launching a new paint protection clear film called Z-Shield, the latest in a growing line of products and technologies devised to protect a vehicle inside and out. The Z-Shield launch, under way now at Michigan locations, is something of a kickoff for a global rebranding of Ziebart, a name still best-known for the automobile rustproofing invented by Kurt Ziebart in the late 1950s, which morphed into a franchise network in the 1960s. Today Ziebart has 400 locations in 32 countries, offering dozens of products and services ranging from antibacterial treatments for car interiors to spray-on truck bed liners, automotive glass repair, window tint and scratch and scuff repair services. Like many companies where the initial products later become commoditized or outdated by advancing technologies, Ziebart - whose memorable slogan was \"It's Us or Rust\" - has wrestled with its legacy as a rustproofing outfit. Today, said President <mark>Dan Baker</mark>, only about 20% of Ziebart's $135 million in worldwide sales come from rustproofing, compared with more than 70% a couple decades ago. Ziebart rustproofing was a popular aftermarket service for car owners in the 1960s and '70s, but auto manufacturers improved their undercoating at the factories - and in 1987 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all began offering 100,000-mile anti-corrosion warranties. <mark>Baker</mark>, who joined the company in 1988, is proud of Ziebart's longevity - the average franchisor lasts only seven years, he said - but admits the firm wrestled with a midlife identity crisis for awhile. \"We went through a period of trying to be everything but rustproofing,\" he said, but the eventual lesson learned was \"to embrace who we are, a trusted brand .\" In a nutshell, the message is still a simple one about protection: Come to Ziebart to keep your car looking, and even smelling, like new. Along with coatings and films to protect the vehicle's exterior, Ziebart shops offer interior detailing packages that include cleaning, stain removal and Germ Defender antibacterial coatings. Touting the virtues of a changing array of new technologies and products is the job of Lisa Walega, Ziebart's marketing director whose team has grown from two to eight people in recent years. This summer, she said, a new website is planned, along with an expanded social media presence. All in all, Ziebart has about 100 corporate employees who are all part-owners; an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) structure was adopted in 1994. All but 12 of its retail stores are franchisee-owned. The company-owned stores, including three in the Detroit area, are used for technology research and testing of new products and tweaks to the business model. Interestingly, amid a steady rollout of new technologies, <mark>Baker</mark> said Ziebart stores have experienced an uptick in orders the past few years for the company's original staple product, rustproofing. What's driving that? Cars and trucks are lasting longer. People are keeping them longer. And car-loan terms have stretched to 84 months. It's a good thing, apparently, that Ziebart didn't abandon its roots in rust.

She experimented with MDMA first on her own before embarking upon a mission to enroll her mother, father, brother, and sister in MDMA-aided family therapy .\" You get a publicly-witnessed permanent record in your heart of your love for each other, \"she told me .\" It's stored in your heart, and you can draw on it forever. \"I sat down with Lalla to discuss what her experiences with MDMA have taught her about building better relationships. Annie Lalla: Professionally, I work with single clients and couples. The couples are often suffering recurring drama and conflict. They don't know how to move through the power struggle. That's kind of my expertise. I think 90 percent of couples never get past the power struggle. Well, for example, whenever myself and my husband are in conflict, we literally map out the conflict space. We've got our laptop out:\" OK, so you're pissed about this, and I'm pissed about that. What does it have to do with sex, reproductive issues, money? \"We're always tracking where we are in the conflict. I think people fight about the same things in the same ways. There are recurring motifs that I'm looking for, and that I use to help the couples I'm working with. What do you do when you find the source of the conflict? What I've come to realize is that it all basically boils down to,\" Oh, you feel unsafe. \"No matter if they're yelling, screaming, crying\u00e2 \u20ac\" if I can feel a power move, I think, Oh, you're scared. So, I try to regulate my nervous system to take care of my sense of safety. Then, from that place, I think about how I can get them back to feeling safe. No matter if they're yelling, screaming, crying\u00e2 \u20ac \"if I can feel a power move, I think, Oh, you're scared. Is the power struggle ever resolved? It's never resolved. The best you can do is to become aware of it, and to manage it. You can't stop wanting to arm wrestle, but you can say,\" I'm arm wrestling intentionally, for something I believe in, and I'm not doing it compulsively or unconsciously. \"Instead of letting your animal use your cognitive functions to do whatever it wants, you align yourself with what your animal is trying to do, and what you think is serving your current and future selves. You find the overlap between those, and that alignment is the place where you operate during your power struggle. What do you mean when you say\" animal \"? We are animals, and the more unsafe we feel, the more we want to control our environment. Every animal down from the amoeba all the way up to us does it, and so I think our relationship with our partners [consists of] replaying old dance routines of unfinished power battles that we had with our first attachment figures: our parents. Have your MDMA experiences changed the way you deal with conflict? Absolutely, yes. MDMA is egolytic [ego-dissolving] and the power struggle is between two egos. So, the more that the two egos feel separate, the more polarized the power struggle is. [With MDMA] you can empathically toggle between your perspective and theirs. How do you use their perspective? If you wanted to break into a house from the outside, you can, but it's way easier if you scope out the house from the inside first. Then you can create a map that you can use to infiltrate. Very stealthy. Stealth is important. The reason why I'm ethically comfortable with stealth is my attention. If the thing you're trying to burgle is the other person's presence and yours, I can get behind that. Most people are trying to burgle things that are not sacred. They're not operating on a sacred mission. What other insights have you gained from MDMA? If you pushed me metaphysically, I would have to say there's another step that I think exists in very intense psychedelic states. It's a state of communion beyond the separateness of self. Your being-ness and my being-ness ceases to be separate. We one-ify. So, I think that's possible in intense mystic states, but I don't think most people get there very often. I think our personality is a series of defenses against unsafe childhood conditions. So we develop a defended self that then becomes our character and personality. Are you able to use that insight to strengthen relationships? On MDMA, in my historic private use\u00e2 \u20ac\" not necessarily with my family, but in my romantic relationships\u00e2 \u20ac \"I can taste where there is a wall [between myself and] the person that I love. And I can feel the wall is obsolete because the ego that is erecting the wall ceases to require it. It's a defense. And when the ego is more porous, it just needs less defenses. What is it defending against? I think our personality is a series of defenses against unsafe childhood conditions. So we develop a defended self that then becomes our character and personality. And, in some ways, I'm grateful for that. I think of a bonsai tree, which is a beautiful work of art. It's a stunted tree, but artfully stunted. So, I feel like the environmental conditions of your life are stunting you into this particular flavor of God. How do you balance a need for defenses with a need for vulnerability? Often your defenses are against circumstances that are no longer the case. You're often using [childhood] strategies in current situations that are obsolete, because you have more resources, intelligence, and wherewithal now. It's like moths moving towards the light. They move towards the light because when they evolved, only stars existed. It kept them alive, and now it kills them. The same strategy that once served life is now destructive. for a project, and I've noticed that those kinds of childhood themes come up again and again. Are dreams something you use in your work? Dreams can be very helpful. I usually try to tell my dream to my partner or someone, because they'll see a pattern that I won't see. The dream is telling me that there's a blind spot. That's why [the issue] has to be smuggled into my dream space. The other trick I use is to identify with each character in the dream, and each item in the dream. So if I dream about a cat walking through a door and falling off a cliff, I'm the cat, I'm the door, and I'm the cliff. I climb into each one, and think, What can I learn from this? They say there's a series of emotions; I really think there's only love and fear. And even then, I don't think there's fear. I think there is just love, and fear is in the shadow of love when you forget temporarily that love is the nature of reality. Can you talk about some of the specific issues that you've worked on with your family? Way back [when we began], there were a lot. My mother had a very marginalized voice in the family, and with my father, there was a subtle tyranny. And through the MDMA sessions, that was a big part of what I was trying to elucidate\u00e2 \u20ac\" the ways in which he unknowingly was perpetrating this inequity. Once it became part of his consciousness, he could see that it was inconsistent with his identity. He wasn't the typical Indian patriarch. He wouldn't let his daughters learn to cook or clean because he never wanted us to be domesticated housewives. He wanted the feminine to be powerful. What do you mean when you say \"subtle tyranny?\" The way it would show up would be like a raised voice, or he would become impenetrable in conversation. He would just repeat the same thing, and you couldn't talk to him about the issue. How did you make him realize the effect he was having? I remember one time, all of us got together and expressed anecdotal descriptions of moments when he had interacted with us in a way that had made us feel smaller. So him hearing that\u00e2 \u20ac \"and being under the influence of the MDMA\u00e2 \u20ac\" his ego was soft enough that he could not take it as an attack, and just hear it as reflections of behavior that was inconsistent with who we wanted to be. We even had him write out some commitments to remember. It's almost like notes to his future self\u00e2 \u20ac \"notes about how he wanted to be as a husband and a father so he could refer to them later. It was his own writing, and his own signature, so there was really strong accountability for taking on the epiphanies that came up. Over the course of five years, he has become less and less tyrannical. It's interesting that you bring up the idea of there being two personas, the MDMA persona and the sober persona. What's the difference? Well, the sober state defends itself more, and the MDMA state is the more real self. What makes it more real? It has less fear. They say there's a series of emotions; I really think there's only love and fear. And even then, I don't think there's fear. I think there is just love, and fear is in the shadow of love when you forget temporarily that love is the nature of reality. There's no such thing as a shadow in and of itself, it's just a lack of sunlight. You could argue that shadows are just as real as the tree and the sun, but there's a way in which the tree is more real. But if I had to bet my life on what's more real, I bet on the thing that inspires me. I consciously confer more reality to the things I'm inspired by. It's to the point now where most of my friends wouldn't know whether I'm on MDMA or not. Getting back to MDMA, I wanted to ask, what was your first time taking it like? It was like home. My whole life up until that point, I was trying to have interactions with people that look like that. As long as I can remember, whenever I've met someone, I was looking for maximal intimacy per square inch per moment in our interaction. What did that look like? Sometimes I would be intrusive, or ask really intimate questions that were socially inappropriate. I just [wanted] to understand all the intricacies of the feelings and thoughts underneath the spoken statements. Shouldn't we be talking about that? Did you expose yourself as well? Or was the exchange mostly one-directional? When I was younger, it was more one-directional. I got alerted to that in high school. I started to realize that everyone felt very exposed around me, but no one actually knew me. Then I realized it was a defense mechanism. MDMA showed me that intimacy is the place that both of us climb into together, and we're naked together. And that felt way better than the other version that I'd been doing. When I was on MDMA, I would have an interaction with another human being I didn't know three minutes ago, and the level of fluid connection and alignment was the highest that I'd ever seen in a first encounter. Are you able to recreate that feeling off of MDMA? I knew from my research not to pin whatever I got from the MDMA onto the MDMA. The MDMA was just the facilitator. Say I was on MDMA right now, and I go and talk to [a nearby woman]. I would feel that I could talk to her easily without having an excuse. I know a lot of people say,\" Oh, it's the MDMA. The MDMA allowed me to talk to her. \"Well, I knew that the MDMA wasn't doing anything that I couldn't normally do. It made me aware of what I could do. And if I took note of what I was doing on MDMA, I could become more like that person when I was off MDMA. It's to the point now where most of my friends wouldn't know whether I'm on MDMA or not. Does your experience with the drug make normal reality less interesting? It makes baseline reality more like a fascinating Sudoku. It's like a mystery. It's very entertaining. I love being on MDMA, but I love being off of it too. My first drug ever was LSD, which goes from six to eight hours and then it's done. It's like going on a roller coaster. Do you say,\" I hate my life when I'm not on a roller coaster? \"No, you enjoy the rest of the park. Why did you choose to use MDMA with your family instead of LSD or mushrooms, for example? I chose MDMA because it's the most likely [drug for] not having anything negative come up or to have a bad trip. It also had the most research behind it, about it being therapeutically useful. What were some of the concerns that you had to overcome with your family about using MDMA? My mom was worried about it being illegal and addictive. She has no knowledge about drugs. Crack, cocaine, heroin\u00e2 \u20ac\" she had them all mixed together [in her mind] with MDMA. So I had to differentiate them for her. I had to use research to help her see that there's not this thing called \"drugs .\" There are specific drugs. First, I had to separate out addictive and not addictive.

[But] alcohol actually has more negative physiological effects in the body and is more addictive. She was worried about MDMA being illegal. And I had to say,\" Yeah, it's illegal. And, here are the reasons why it's probably illegal. It doesn't suit the status quo powers in the world. \"My sister was like,\" I'm going to go crazy. \"She thought she could get physically hurt.

What's your end goal with all of this work? I want myself and the people around me to feel the most alive. I mean, basically I think every emotion is a messenger from the unconscious mind to deliver an important insight. Every unfelt emotion becomes a pathology, an addiction, or a neurosis. I'm trying to teach my family, my friends, and the world at large how to hold a wider range of their emotional experiences, and in order to do that, I have to keep practicing doing that myself. The extent that you feel your emotion is the extent [to which] you can develop yourself and actualize.

Glen Perkins pitched in all three games of the Twins' weekend sweep of the Astros, and there may be a decision to make if the Twins have a late lead tonight. \"If he says he feels great, we go with what he says he feels,\" Gardenhire said of his closer, whose 44 innings are fewest among pitchers who have been with the Twins all year. \"Perk will tell us. If he's a little beat up, or his arm is a little dead, he'll definitely tell us. We've had him do it before. As long as he's honest with us, we're OK with that .\" The 30-year-old closer said he's \"good to go,\" in the Twins' clubhouse before the game. Perkins hasn't pitched on four straight days since June 30-July 3 of last season. The Twins have lost five of their six games at Kauffman Stadium this year, and were swept by the Royals in Target Field last week, so they definitely have some trends they want to reverse. So does Kevin Correis, tonight's starter, who won only one game in June and one game in July. Pedro Florimon remains out for another game with a wrist injury, but he's on the field taking batting practice, and should return during this series.

saw a dozen or so overgrown, vacant lots that were magnets for the illegal dumping of junk, garbage and debris. \"we were always policing the vacant lots,\" said meade, a longtime resident of the king irving neighborhood just north of downtown des moines. when meade looks out her door now, she sees new houses on the once vacant lots. since 2003, the king irving neighborhood has seen a 50 percent drop in vacant, buildable lots, a new city report shows. assessed property values have increased 47 percent in the past decade, compared to a 31 increase citywide. in addition, millions of dollars have been pumped into the area for new curbs and sewers. the progress is driven by the pride, pluck and hard work of residents who have banded together to help transform the area from one of des moines' most distressed neighborhoods into one of its most noticeably improved. that resiliency is why king irving residents didn't panic earlier this summer after a string of violent incidents near evelyn davis park. residents galvanized and pressed for solutions. it's what they've done for years. \"we got together and said:\" something has to be done now,' \"meade said .\" it was a line in the sand. \"the gains in the neighborhood have been hard fought .\" there's been a tremendous amount of progress, but the thing is you can't stop working or everything starts to slide backwards, \"said joann muldoon, who's lived in the king irving neighborhood for 20 years .\" everybody has to keep at it because it's a work in progress. \"one of the best indicators of king irving's renewal is its strong gains in property values. coordinated efforts between city leaders, nonprofit groups and adjoining neighborhood associations have spurred the revitalization .\" a drive through the neighborhood would tell you and me the condition of the housing stock and the way families feel about living in the neighborhood is much different than it was five years ago, \"mayor frank cownie said .\" it's the leadership of the people up there and their willingness to work with the city and other groups that have made the difference. \"higher property values and success redeveloping long-vacant residential lots are all positive signs, said <mark>gary taylor</mark>, a professor of community and regional planning at iowa state university .\" if there's been a perception for a long time that a certain neighborhood is troubled, it's more difficult to get people to invest and make the turnaround happen, \"<mark>taylor</mark> said .\" you start to see improvement stick when, over time, you see a gradual rise in incomes and housing values creep back up and stay strong. \"volunteers have helped bring the low - to moderate-income neighborhood back after years of decline. their ranks must grow to help sustain and expand the neighborhood's housing improvements and business growth, leaders say. a $1 million grant to help strengthen king irving and adjacent mondamin presidential neighborhood was provided by thrivent financial for lutherans in 2008. that money went toward housing improvements, block cleanups, public safety, youth programs and job opportunities .\" right now, the biggest challenge is getting more people involved, \"said robin hamel, project manager for thrivent builds neighborhoods. in the early 1900s, the neighborhood was home to various movie theaters, grocery stores, nightclubs, drug stores and filling stations. things started to slide in the 1960s, and king irving's population dropped by nearly one-third during the '70s. scores of abandoned, dilapidated houses and other buildings were razed. the demolitions eventually included irving junior high school, which closed in the 1970s. that site is now home to the forest avenue library and evelyn davis park. the neighborhood was left with more than 200 vacant lots, a problem the city, residents and nonprofit groups have fought over the past 10 years. vacant and foreclosed properties can weaken values of surrounding houses, spawn more foreclosures, attract squatters, vandals and thieves and become nuisances that threaten public safety, experts say. city officials estimate there are 1,770 vacant lots in des moines. sixty-two percent of the lots with development potential are in the northern half of the city, an analysis by city officials shows. king irving had 152 buildable, vacant lots seven years ago. there are 73 today. developing those lots is important to king irving and all of des moines because mature cities typically must grow from within .\" the suburbs build tax base by gaining ground and greenfield development, \"said <mark>taylor</mark>, the isu professor .\" the landlocked, core cities don't have those same opportunities, so they have to build tax base from within and invest in development on land that they already have. \"the king irving, mondamin presidential, river bend and cheat - om park neighborhoods north of downtown all stand to gain from downtown's ongoing renewal .\" the proximity to downtown is going to be a selling point, \"<mark>taylor</mark> said. the neighborhood rebound is also driven by the work of nonprofit organizations such as greater des moines habitat for humanity, home, inc., thrivent and the neighborhood finance corporation, which have focused heavily on the area's rebirth .\" i'm in it every single day and there have been significant changes, especially with the housing, \"said hamel, the thrivent coordinator. by the end of 2009, greater des moines habitat for humanity had finished 65 houses in the king irving and mondamin presidential neighborhoods, bringing $6 million of affordable housing to the area. over the past two years, the neighborhoods have also seen some $2 million in federal grant money to lessen the impact of foreclosures and redevelop vacant lots, a core recommendation in a 2004 king irving neighborhood improvement plan .\" the housing improvements have been key, \"said muldoon, president of the king irving neighborhood association. for instance, the assessed value of one property on the near north side increased from $7,100 to $127,600 when a house was built on a once-vacant lot. the neighborhood finance corporation has also made 51 loans to other nonprofits, developers and private homeowners totaling $3.75 million in the last several years. the loans have resulted in new construction, renovations, home purchases, refinances and second mortgages. the private investments bolster public improvements meant to spur revitalization. taxpayers have spent $1.8 million on street, curb and sidewalk improvements. sewer improvements in the area surpass $2 million. also, some $875,000 has been invested at evelyn davis park in the past several years to improve amenities, security and programs at the park, which some call the town square of the king irving neighborhood. money raised for the various initiatives has included grants from polk county, vision iowa and donations from local business leaders. about 100 people packed into the steamy gymnasium at king elementary school last month to discuss problems in and around evelyn davis park. a week earlier, residents had rallied to make a statement and stake their claim to the 9.8-acre park located at 1400 forest ave. the park is named after a community leader and longtime advocate for children and the poor who died in 2001. turmoil near the park often crops up in the spring, but incidents earlier this year were exceptional, area residents have said. since then, residents and various community groups have held every meeting and activity they can in the park .\" even if good things have been happening for years, one bad thing can overshadow that progress, \"hamel said. the city's parks department has daily activities at evelyn davis park for children through mid-august. in addition, police have also stepped up patrols. two officers are in the park from 4 p.m. until closing time on fridays through sundays. the results?\" so far, so good, \"said des moines police lt. <mark>joe gonzalez</mark>.\" more people and neighborhood organizations have been using the park a lot more frequently, which makes a difference. \"don mayberry, who lives on carpenter avenue across the street from the park, agreed .\" regardless of what people might read or hear, this is a safe neighborhood, \"said mayberry, who's lived in the area for about 50 years. crime patterns in the king irving area have been on par with most other parts of the city over the past 60 days, city data show. residents say things have been quiet .\" it's no different than any other neighborhood in the city, \"<mark>gonzalez</mark> said .\" sometimes things can flare up. \"residents are committed to keeping the park - their town square - safe because its vitality is a symbol for everything they've worked for all these years. they don't dismiss or downplay problems that shook the area just two months ago, meade said. they simply refuse to let the incidents define them or their neighborhood. you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment. paris lam, 4, cools off in the

law to fight for rights sign in to e-mail print by verna yu published: december 22, 2009 hong kong - if not for his \"bad\" family background, mo shaoping might be a senior military officer now. instead, he has become one of china's leading human rights lawyers, representing prominent political dissidents, journalists and even practitioners of the banned falun gong sect. skip to next paragraph related verdict in trial of chinese dissident could come friday (december 23, 2009) his clients have included <mark>huang qi</mark>, who recently was sentenced to three years in prison after demanding an investigation of school collapses in last year's sichuan earthquake; <mark>zhao yan</mark>, a researcher for the new york times who was accused of revealing state secrets; and <mark>liu xiaobo</mark>, who was jailed three times before his current detention, charged with \"inciting subversion\" for his work on the charter 08 democracy manifesto. at the trial, which started wednesday, mr. <mark>liu</mark> will be represented by other lawyers from mr. mo's firm. mr. mo has been barred from representing mr. <mark>liu</mark> directly, because he also signed charter 08, which calls for political reforms and the rule of law. \"i don't agree that he should be convicted,\" mr. mo said of mr. <mark>liu</mark>. \"these things can be debated over, but you can't just send people to prison .\" taking on politically sensitive cases can be hazardous for chinese lawyers, but mr. mo has made this his mission for more than a decade. he began defending dissidents in 1995, when the wife of <mark>liu</mark> nianchun, a veteran democracy advocate, could not find any other lawyer to defend her husband. \"my position is that whatever crime someone has committed, he should always have the right to a lawyer. that is one of the most basic human rights,\" mr. mo, 51, said in an interview in hong kong, where he was attending his daughter's university graduation. \"i believe it is for posterity to judge who is right or wrong .\" perhaps fortunately for his clients, mr. mo was thwarted in his original career ambitions. he joined the army at the age of 18 in 1976, just as the cultural revolution ended. but when he tried to enter a military college a year later, he was told he did not qualify because of his \"complex family background .\" he later learned what that meant. his paternal grandfather had been a landlord and a delegate to the national legislature under the kuomintang government, before the communists took power in 1949. his maternal grandfather had been a professor of philosophy and religion, with a doctorate from the university of chicago. both men had died during the cultural revolution, one tortured by red guards, the other driven to suicide. mr. mo, born in beijing, had never met either grandfather, both of whom had lived in southern china; he had not even known of their deaths, or the circumstances. because of the political climate of the time, his parents - both doctors who were sent to labor in the countryside along with other intellectuals during the cultural revolution - had never discussed his grandfathers' undesirably \"bourgeois\" backgrounds with him. asked whether his grandfathers' sufferings had given him a sense of solidarity with those who face political persecution, the mild-mannered, bespectacled lawyer laughed. \"i suppose it might be in my genes,\" he said. after he left the army in 1980, he was assigned to work at the beijing municipal procuratorate and later studied law at the beijing college of politics and law and the prestigious chinese academy of social sciences. while the new york-based organization human rights watch praises mr. mo as having handled more high-profile human rights cases than any other lawyer in china, he notes that these are also the riskiest and most time-consuming cases and bring the least monetary reward. and he has yet to win one. his clients all have been jailed or exiled for promoting democracy or daring to challenge the communist party's monopoly on power. \"it's impossible to win these cases,\" he said. \"the best you can hope for is a compromise .\" \"compromise\" means the defendant might be given a suspended sentence or be permitted to go into exile, as was xu wenli, a founder of the banned china democracy party. fighting cases that you never win could be demoralizing, but mr. mo insists his efforts eventually will be vindicated. \"if you don't even speak for them, no one will hear their voices,\" he said of his clients. \"but history will prove whether they were right or wrong .\" mr. mo says recent years have been particularly difficult for lawyers. he cited the example of the beijing-based legal aid center open constitution initiative, which has challenged china's so-called \"black jails\" and campaigned for the rights of death-row inmates. recently it was shut down, ostensibly for tax evasion. and more than a dozen rights lawyers were disbarred after failing a mandatory annual review, widely criticized as a vetting system to disqualify lawyers disliked by the authorities. \"if this is used to crack down on or to target those who are not obedient,\" mr. mo said, \"then it isn't right .\" given such harsh conditions, and the publicity his career has attracted - time magazine named him an \"asian hero\" in 2003, and he received the french government's human rights prize in 2007 - is mr. mo worried that he might be a target? he said his wife, who also is a lawyer, worries about him. his phone is monitored, and the authorities often summon him over cases he is handling. still, mr. mo believes he has been allowed to continue his practice and travel freely because he focuses on the legal technicalities of his cases and avoids emotive political statements. \"i do my bit to push forward democracy and rule of law,\" he said, \"but writing essays is not my thing .\" nicholas bequelin, a senior asia researcher at human rights watch, said few lawyers had mr. mo's ability to handle political cases in a strictly professional, depoliticized way. \"not many lawyers have been able to emulate his example,\" mr. bequelin said, \"because they lacked the tactical skills needed to know when to back down and when to push forward, but also because beijing was not ready to tolerate many more prominent defenders for high-profile dissidents .\" mr. mo remains hopeful about his country's future. democracy, he said, is never a straightforward road. \"it's a historical trend. china will move towards democracy, rule of law and constitutional governance,\" he said. \"and no one can stand in its way .\" more articles in world \"a version of this article appeared in print on december 23, 2009, in the international
