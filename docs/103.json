Pulisic's first Chelsea goals arrived in a hurry as he rewarded <mark>Frank Lampard</mark>'s decision to give him a first league start since August with a match-winning performance, scoring in the 21st, 45th and 56th minutes to put them in complete control before Willian added a fourth. Pulisic's was a perfect hat-trick--left foot, right foot and a header--as he punished defensive mistakes in the first half before heading in Mason Mount's cross early in the second.

While the IPTL claimed it was a resounding success, the future of Amritraj's project appeared a touch uncertain after a low-key inaugural season in 2014. The Delhi franchise has pulled out of the CTL this year--Nagpur and Raipur have joined the league, with any of Bangalore, Pune and Chennai franchise likely to pitch for the sixth team. \"We give everyone the option to stay or opt out,\" Amritraj explained. He has enhanced the league's star power this year--never mind some of the retirees--contracting Marcos Baghdatis, Andreas Seppi, Fernando Verdasco, Ivo Karlovic, former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, and Thomas Muster, the original king of clay before Rafael Nadal became the final word on red dirt. However, the biggest draw of the league this year has to be US Open champion Flavia Pennetta of Italy, who will represent Mumbai Masters. Drummers and Gera music (which has a touch of Samba) enlivened the players draft at a city hotel yesterday. Going by CTL's star galaxy this year, the action should be as gripping. Rules tweaked Amritraj explained that the league to be held from November 23 to December 6 has been tweaked to fit into the time slot of two-and-a-half hours to suit prime time viewing. \"Last year, when we had two matches per day and most of the matches were close, each day play got extended up to three and a half hours or more. So we had to make some changes so that this time around only one match (tie) will be held per day with a 7 PM start and an expected 9:30 -9:45 pm end,\" he said. \"Each match would comprise one set only (same as last year) but this year the set would be played to five games instead of six. Sets can be won from 5-0 to 5-4 and if it's 4-all a 9-point tie-break would be held,\" he said. The format remains the same: legends' singles, ATP players' singles, WTA players' singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles.

It's just such a shame that racism still exists in 2019. When will this nonsense stop? \"Chelsea boss <mark>Lampard</mark> lamented the situation, admitting he would support his players walking off if subjected to a future racism storm .\" In terms of walking off the pitch, I think that has to feel right in the moment, \"said <mark>Lampard</mark>.\" And until that moment comes I don't want to guess what I would do. It would depend what the players were feeling and saying. \"But I would be absolutely, 100 per cent behind them if (they wanted to walk off), and I'm sure it would be a group decision. But we're not there yet, so it's hypothetical to a degree .\" All I know is that Toni Rudiger said he heard some racist chanting or comments, and I haven't had chance for an individual conversation with Toni. Watch more Tottenham issue statement after Chelsea's Rudiger \"racially abused'\" Of course I'll support Toni as we would support any of our players, or in fact any opposition players. Wherever this happens it needs to be dealt with. \"If it happened and it's fact, then punishment is needed and it needs to be strong .\" Willian's brace handed Chelsea a stunning 2-0 win at Spurs, who had Son Heung-min sent off for kicking out at Rudiger. Defender Rudiger complained of alleged racist abuse in the second half in north London, leaving Tottenham pledging to complete a full investigation. \"We are now conducting a thorough investigation which will include liaising with Chelsea and their players for their observations,\" read a Tottenham statement. \"Any form of racism is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our stadium. We take any such allegations extremely seriously and shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to be behaving in such a way, including stadium bans .\" Tottenham boss Mourinho--who sarcastically said he hoped Rudiger \"recovers quick from the broken ribs\" after Son's glancing blow--backed referee <mark>Taylor</mark>'s stance in halting the match. <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> applauds his Chelsea players at Tottenham (REUTERS) \"I've not much to say apart from it's something that saddens me,\" said Mourinho. \"I hate racism in society, I hate racism in football, I'm disappointed that things like that can still happen .\" But the referee stopped the game, spoke with the players, spoke with the coaches, spoke with the captains. \"As soon as I knew the reasons why the game was stopped I obviously understood and accepted it .\" Rudiger tweeted after the game and included the hashtags \u00a3 NoToRacism and \u00a3 PleaseGetSomeBasicEducation, and Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham hailed his team-mate's response. \"He is a strong character and it showed because he is a fantastic player and overcame it,\" he said. \"Everyone is doing as much as they can to make a stop for it. But there are going to be one or two people who will always remain the same .\" More about <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> | Antonio Rudiger | chelsea fc | Premier League | Show {{#moreThan 3_total}} {{value_total}} {{/ moreThan3_total}} comments Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

that's why traditional bulbs are so hot to the touch. however, thanks to a piece of 2007 legislation, traditional incandescent bulbs will soon become a thing of the past. the bush-era law, called the energy independence and security act, set energy-efficiency standards for light bulbs that will come fully into effect in 2012. the law will require light bulbs to use 25-30 percent less power than incandescents use today. it's a mandate that will quickly slash residential and commercial energy use, lowering the nation's carbon footprint and utility bills at the same time. predicted savings include $13 billion in energy costs and the prevention of 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, reported noah horowitz, senior scientist at the natural resources defense council's energy program, in a blog post. overall, the legislation will save as much electricity each year as that used by all the homes in the state of texas. in theory, the legislation sounds like a no-brainer. australia, brazil and the european union have already enacted their own, parallel laws. yet in the united states, some consumers and activists have interpreted the act as a ban on incandescent bulbs. others believe that energy-efficient alternatives will necessarily cost more, deliver lower quality light and pose a health risk. texas congressman <mark>joe barton</mark> recently proposed a repeal of the legislation, and editorials occasionally crop up in leading newspapers, from the wall street journal to the washington times, protesting the \"light bulb ban .\" true, energy efficiency standards will inevitably make most incandescent bulbs obsolete, and give a boost to their more energy-efficient competitors, compact florescent bulbs (cfls) and light emitting diodes (leds). yet \"no one is requiring you to buy a cfl-not now, not ever,\" horowitz wrote. \"the regulation is simply making manufacturers build you a better bulb .\" cfl and led proponents point out that alternative lighting options are becoming cheaper, safer and more aesthetically pleasing every day, and that the legislation will force manufacturers to make them even better. for consumers, the biggest deterrent to choosing cfls and leds \"is the initial cost,\" says <mark>brian howard</mark>, web editor at green lighting. yet although cfls and leds cost more initially, <mark>howard</mark> explains, over time they can save consumers hundreds of dollars in reduced energy costs. cfls use four times less energy to run and last ten times as long as traditional incandescents: this means that each bulb, over its lifetime, actually costs $30 less than an incandescent. think of it this way: incandescents cost less upfront, but come will sneaky hidden fees. another complaint <mark>howard</mark> often hears, he says, is \"i tried a cfl years ago, and i hated it .\" <mark>howard</mark> points out that technology has improved radically since bulbs first hit the market. consumers can now buy energy-efficient bulbs that fit pretty much any light fixture and choose from a whole range of light effects. a while cfls do contain mercury, with proper handling, they produce a minimal health risk. each cfl bulb carries about 5 milligrams of mercury, \"just enough to cover a ballpoint pen tip .\" \"unless you wipe up mercury [without gloves] and then lick your hand, you're probably going to be okay,\" says russ leslie, associate director of the lighting research center at rensselaer polytechnic institute, as reported by popular mechanics. popular mechanics crunched the numbers and discovered that traditional incandescent bulbs actually introduce more mercury into the environment over their product life cycle. because incandescents consume more energy, they're responsible for a greater amount of pollution associated with electricity generation, including the release of trace amounts of mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the surrounding environment. over the next couple of years, you'll probably see fewer and fewer incandescent bulbs on store shelves - and hear a lot more from pundits, both on the right and left, about the light bulb legislation. the best way to cut through the hype? try out some energy-efficient alternatives, and find out how they can fit your lifestyle and save you money. click for your chance to win great prizes in the newschannel 10 pro football pick 'em contest. connect with local businesses. click here. visit the amarillo chapter and find out more on how you can make in impact. find out what and when programs come on newschannel 10. link to the official texas lottery website to see if you have won!"}, {"articleID": "2016042515_00198615_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"]}, "date": "2016-04-25", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/25/chris-christie-urges-lawmakers-to-rewrit", "content": "dashcamGov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) is leaving the door open for his support of a bill requiring police departments to equip their vehicles with dashboard cameras, after that law was ruled an unfunded mandated by the Council on Local Mandates. \"I signed it the last time so I'm certainly willing to look at it,\" Christie said, \"but look at it in light of the new costs .\" The dashcam bill, first introduced in 2014, included a $25 surcharge on DWI offenses as a method of paying for the dashcams. Christie has not been shy to support increased fines as a method of paying for government mandates before. In 2013, he signed a bill into law that increased penalties for failure to keep right from the $50 to $200 range to the $100 to $300 range, including a $50 surcharge to pay for \"keep right\" sign. While the dashcam bill's sponsor argues that the Council on Local Mandates doesn't have the power to review partially funded mandates and asked Christie to appeal the decision, Christie agreed with the council that its decisions were not reviewable. The New Jersey Constitution calls the council's decisions \"political and not judicial determinations .\" The Constitutional provision about the Council on Local Mandates does offer a number of other ways legislation can avoid review by the council, including laws, rules, or regulations \"which implement the provisions of this Constitution,\" something the bill's sponsors perhaps could have argued the dashcam law did, but didn't argue. Another provision exempts laws, rules, or regulations \"which are required to comply with federal laws or rules or to meet eligibility standards for federal entitlements .\" There are no federal rules tying federal funding of local and state law enforcement to transparency measures like installing dashboard cameras or using body cameras. I've previously suggested a tax on police associations and unions to pay for the dashcam, but suspect that's an idea that would be met in the New Jersey legislature with bipartisan opposition.

Aziz Ansari brilliantly called out <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s xenophobic rhetoric in a scathing op-ed for the New York Times this past June. The \"Master of None\" writer, actor and director spoke about the article, which quickly went viral, in a new interview with The Daily Beast. \"You know, I put out that article and I thought like,\" Maybe this will resonate with other brown people, \"' Ansari said .\" But it ended up being like the most-emailed, most-viewed article on the site for a couple of days. People come up to me of all different races, all different religions like, \"That's really cool that you wrote that. I really liked that article .\" ' In the op-ed, Ansari spoke about his parents, who are from India, and his family's Muslim faith. The actor started it off with an anecdote, telling his mother not to go near a mosque out of fear she would be hurt, thanks to the sort of hate Trump believes in. \"Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels,\" the actor wrote. \"It's visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense .\" As Ansari explains in his interview with The Daily Beast, Trump's xenophobic comments are a result of the GOP candidate's fear of anyone who doesn't look exactly like his tiny handed, spray-tanned self. \"Blaming them for something, misrepresenting them, making them some sort of strange character that they're not, not giving them the depth that he would give other white people,\" Ansari said, adding, \"What gives me hope is that I think sometimes the people that are more negative, kind of troll-y type people, they're very loud, but I think they're a loud minority. It's a strange juxtaposition, but I think there are still plenty of good people. I have hope .\" To read the rest of Ansari's interview with The Daily Beast, head here.

This time it was them with a mountain to climb after London rivals Quins went into half-time leading 17-6 at the Olympic Stadium. While the wheels of England's chariot completely came off in their Calcutta Cup horror show, Saracens responded like the champions they are.

Davis/The Washington Post) Aaron C. Davis March 17 at 2:19 PM But if that's what you like - a dank, resinous pint - or if you're willing to at least try it, this could be your kind of St. Patrick's Day in D.C.. The District's DC Brau will tap a few green-decorated kegs of its new seasonal india pale ale dubbed \"Smells Like Freedom\" on Tuesday night, for what is bound to be a first in the District's protracted fight for full voting rights. threats of jail time by congressional Republicans. Possession, sharing and home cultivation of marijuana is now legal in the District. But Congress has blocked legal sales or purchases of pot. conflict has spurred sit-ins, marches, and as late as Tuesday, a band of pro-marijuana advocates dressed up in colonial garb who barged into the Capitol Hill office of House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a leading opponent of legalization in D.C.. The protestors offered a glass peace pipe of sorts. Chaffetz's staffers declined. Brewing a marijuana protest beer, however, was far less spontaneous. It's been fermenting, in fact, since last fall, said Brandon Skall, chief executive and co-founder of DC Brau Brewing Co. DC Brau and Longmont, Colo.-based Oskar Blues Brewing, both of which bottle their beers in cans, had for more than a year been looking for a reason to team up on a brewing project. In e-mails last fall, Skall said he laid out the case for doing a beer together around D.C.'s legalization effort and the rarely-noticed plight of the 650,000 D.C. residents who have no voting rights in Congress. Oskar executives were sold, and brewers there took to their lab, Skall said. They found three experimental hops that, when combined, produced a distinctly marijuana-like aroma. \"The experimental hops were definitely unique,\" said DC Brau brewer <mark>Christopher Graham</mark>. \"Some were over the top with melon. Some had a lot of berry notes. But all had that undertone of piney, resinous, dank quality that someone would expect from a nugget\" of marijuana, he said. For Skall, the issue is more about the tax bill he said he pays every year to the District while feeling like a second-class citizen. \"I'll tell you straight up, I don't smoke pot,\" Skall said, \"but I believe 100 percent in people's freedom to do so. I think that if we didn't have people standing for the end of prohibition that this business would not be here today .\" But at root, he said, it's about the fact that the District could only partially legalize marijuana, instead of fully like Colorado, which designated much of the revenue from taxes on pot to go to schools. \"Something needs to change with D.C., it's ridiculous,\" Skall said. \"I live here, I'm about to have a second child here. We're sending our children to school in Washington, D.C. - There's no reason we shouldn't be able to benefit the same way they do in Colorado .\" You walk into a D.C. public school, you see empty bookshelves, you seen underfunding, you see teachers going out and spending their money to buy kids supplies. We should be able to benefit the same way that other states do. \"The unveiling of the beer comes Tuesday night at Meridian Pint in the District's Columbia Heights neighborhood, where Initiative 71 supporters gathered on Election Night last year to celebrate legalization.

verdict rejecting vodafone's plea opposing the merger of the two essar group companies, the indian conglomerate on thursday said its 33% stake in vodafone essar was worth more than the $5 billion that vodafone was offering it. essar's stance counters vodafone group plc chief executive vittorio colao's arguments on tuesday that its jv partner agreed to sell its 33% stake for $5 billion as it could not get a higher valuation. the madras high court on thursday approved the merger of india securities with essar telecommunications holdings pvt ltd that owns an indirect 11% stake in vodafone essar. vodafone had opposed the merger, saying this could be misinterpreted as a fair market value for unlisted vodafone essar, india's second largest telecoms company by customers. \"we have always believed that the fair market value of vodafone essar is higher than the underwritten value, and this is especially so in light of the recent stellar performance of the company,\" an essar spokesperson said, adding that the verdict vindicated the company's stand that \"vodafone did not have any locus standi in relation to this merger as it was neither a shareholder nor a creditor of the relevant companies\". uk-headquartered vodafone said it was \"disappointed\" that the madras high court did not feel it necessary to further investigate the merger. it said the verdict would not affect a separate deal to buy out essar from the joint venture and was confident that the process would be \"completed no later than november this year\". executives close to essar also said despite the high court order it was too late for public shareholders of isl to benefit from this decision as vodafone had already announced it was buying out the essar group's one-third stake in its indian jv. the high court also struck down the opposition of the income-tax department to the merger. rejecting vodafone's plea against the merger, justice <mark>vinod kumar</mark> sharma said the company had no locus standi to file an objection. the agreement between vodafone and essar was formed in two parts: one, a put, or sell, option for 22% held by the essar group overseas and, the other, a call, or buy, option for vodafone to buy 11% stake the essar group held in india. essar had the first right to exercise its option, but if it tendered its entire 22% stake, vodafone's option would become valid. on tuesday, colao had told et that it would not pay more than $5 billion for buying out the ruias' 33% stake. \"essar had two options: sell their entire stake for $5 billion as per the earlier agreement, or appoint an independent entity to arrive at a fair market valuation. that they choose the underwritten floor price proves they could not get a higher valuation (than $5 billion),\" he had said. he also added that ruias' seeking a higher price was a \"psychological\" tactic that all entrepreneurs employ during negotiations. while vodafone's announcement was aimed at ending months of bickering between the two partners and giving it complete ownership of the indian entity, et had recently reported the outbreak of peace was shortlived as both partners appeared to be headed for a new round of confrontation as the ruias' were seeking to extract a higher price for its stake. essar has also argued that its 11% stake held in india is being bought by vodafone is subject to the reserve bank regulations. the april 2010 rbi resolution, which sought to protect domestic companies from aggressive multinational buyers, mandates that indian shares in privately held firms should be valued under the discounted cash flow method. under this method, essar's 11% stake in vodafone essar is worth $1.7-1 .8 billion, compared with the purchase option that pegs it at $1.2 billion \"rbi is also examining whether it would permit vodafone to purchase these shares for $1.2 billion against the discounted cash flow valuation of $1.7 billion,\" one of the executives said. the executives also said that both partners had \"appointed standard chartered bank, goldman sachs and ubs to determine a fair market value of vodafone essar, in advance of the put options, but the valuation exercise by the banks never actually got completed and essar was forced to exercise the fixed price option as time was running out\". they also objected to the vodafone chief executive's announcement that the company was looking at its indian operations by the year-end following the exit of its jv partner. according to them, essar last year pushed for listing vodafone essar but was unsuccessful as \"vodafone refused to dilute its its shareholding\" ."}]
