"content": "(sports network) - playing seven of their final nine games at home should work in the coyotes' favor, but what head coach dave tippett feels was a questionable call prevented them from starting that span with a victory. after having a five-game winning streak halted over the weekend, phoenix will look to rebound tonight versus the fading st. louis blues at jobing.com arena. the coyotes opened a six-game homestand on sunday against the defending stanley cup-champion blackhawks, but ended up on the wrong end of a 2-1 decision after chicago's chris campoli scored a power-play goal in the third period. the game-winner came with shane doan in the box for holding midway through the frame. tippett didn't like the call in such a meaningful game for both teams. \"i've watched it about 20 times,\" tippett said. \"just finished watching it just as i walked in the door here. i don't understand it. i don't understand it at all. to me there's no hold whatsoever there. it's disappointing that a call can have an impact like that in a very competitive game in a very tight playoff race .\" eric belanger scored and ilya bryzgalov ended with 26 saves for the coyotes, who had been 6-0-1 in their previous seven games and sit fourth overall in the western conference, just one ahead of the kings. phoenix also trails san jose by three points for first place in the pacific division and though it has played one more game than the sharks, the two clubs will meet three more times this season. that includes a visit from the sharks on saturday as part of this homestand. first, the coyotes will deal with a blues club that has lost three of its last four and sits 13th in the west with 73 points. st. louis is 12 back of a playoff spot with 10 games to play, but would also have to leap past five clubs to get into the eighth spot. st. louis fell behind early to san jose on saturday and never recovered in a 5-3 loss. jaroslav halak was pulled after yielding three goals on 10 shots to open the game, while ty conklin made 22 saves in relief. \"they've found their game. they've got really good balance through their lineup,\" blues head coach davis payne said of the sharks. t.j. hensick scored his first goal since nov. 8 of last season, while <mark>david backes</mark> and <mark>andy mcdonald</mark> also scored. the blues fell to 1-2 on a four-game road trip, but could have center philip mcrae back on the ice for the swing's finale. mcrae has been out since feb. 25 because of a lower-body injury. the coyotes have won two of three versus the blues this year, including a 5-3 victory when the clubs last met in phoenix way back on nov. 13. <mark>ray whitney</mark> netted a hat trick and had five points in the 5-3 triumph.", "articleID":

using soaring oil revenue to pump out a pre-election budget aimed at wooing voters with tax cuts. the budget increases how much people can earn before having to fork over cash to the government. the basic personal and spousal exemptions increase by $1,000 each and the exemption for dependant children increases by $500 per child. h4 class = \"regseriflbl large\" > more related to this story finance minister ken krawetz said wednesday that the changes combined with a low-income tax credit introduced in 2008 mean a family of four will pay no tax on the first $45,550 of combined income. \"that's the highest income threshold in canada,\" said mr. krawetz. \"in other words, that family and most saskatchewan families with dependant children can now earn more tax-free income in saskatchewan than any place else in canada .\" a family of four with an income of $50,000 will save $2,447 a year. the budget also brings long-awaited cuts to the education portion of property taxes and slices the small business tax rate to two per cent from 4.5 per cent beginning july 1. it's the last budget before the provincial election in november. however, premier <mark>brad wall</mark> said the government is not priming people for the vote. \"this is not constructed to be an election budget. it's constructed to be a budget that keeps our promises and builds on the saskatchewan advantage,\" said mr. <mark>wall</mark>. \"however, i would be happy to campaign on it .\" other goodies include $216.8-million for municipalities, which finally get their promised one-point share of the provincial sales tax, and $285-million for highway repaving and infrastructure projects. there's $12.6-million for the saskatchewan cancer agency to allow for a doubling of bone marrow transplants, additional colorectal screenings and more cancer treatments. another $15.3-million will be spent to address recommendations made in last year's child welfare review, including $750,000 to add 30 new child protection workers. the budget projects revenue of $10.79-billion - up 8.5 per cent from 2010-2011 - and total spending of $10.67-billion, which is up 5.5 per cent. that leaves a surplus of $115-million in the general revenue fund. on a summary basis, which takes into account all areas of government including crown corporations, the surplus is expected to be $54.3-million. the government plans to take $325-million from its rainy-day savings account to pay down general revenue fund debt. the payment brings the debt to $3.81-billion - the lowest level since 1987-88. it's different than last year when the government tabled a budget where spending outpaced revenue and the province relied on savings to keep the books in the black. but the opposition new democrats argued the budget doesn't go far enough to help low-income people, seniors on fixed incomes or students. \"for all the money that's being announced, it lacks vision and i don't find it very inspiring,\" said ndp leader dwain lingenfelter. \"it will impact some, but my sense is that the families, many of them who we've been talking to up in the flooded area, won't be paying any income tax this year because they have no income. or many people who are on low or minimum income, who aren't paying any income tax, aren't going to feel the benefit of this budget at all .\" the ndp also raised concerns about growing crown debt, which budget documents suggest will increase by $810 million. other reaction to the budget was mixed. the saskatchewan urban municipalities association said getting one point of the pst gives communities revenue predictability, which allows for better future planning. the saskatchewan chamber of commerce said \"it's a pretty good budget,\" but the government could have gone further on property tax breaks. \"it's clearly an election budget. there's little bits and pieces for everybody. everybody should at least have an appetizer-size feeling that they've achieved something here,\" said chamber ceo steve mclellan. \"they're moving in the right direction and the minister said,\" we've taken some steps forward. we're sending the message that property tax is important .' but at the end of the day, i would like to have seen this to be a very significant step forward. it's an election year - we didn't see that. \"but it was anti-poverty advocates who were most upset. they noted there's just $1.7-million for two new initiatives to create affordable housing in saskatchewan .\" i really think it's quite unbelievable that at a time of an economic boom and massive resource wealth that there's really so little in this budget for low-income people, to improve the pocketbook of low-income people, \"said peter gilmer with the regina anti-poverty ministry .\" this is really a very limited response to the housing crisis in the province right now. \"mr. gilmer said the income tax break won't help either .\" you have to have a significant income to make ends meet. a tax cut on nothing is nothing, \"said mr. gilmer .\" we need to improve people's incomes. we also have to make sure that their cost for basic needs like housing are affordable and this budget, quite frankly, doesn't do that. \"there are also some concerns about unbudgeted expenses down the road, including contracts with labour groups or potential disasters. the watershed authority has already warned there's a high likelihood of flooding again this year, especially in southern saskatchewan. disclaimer? copyright 2011 the globe and mail inc. all rights reserved. m5v 2s9 phillip

receive some compensation for the billions lost by failed finance companies. kiwi investors have been screwed for more than $3.5 billion in company collapses and failed finances - but the man who is set next month to step into the job as the country's top financial cop says he will have the power to turn back time and chase compensation from firms that have gone under. <mark>sean hughes</mark> is chief executive-designate of the financial markets authority - the super regulator that will be given unparalleled powers to fight finance and commercial fraud. \"we have got civil cases that we are going to have an ability to pursue compensation for investors,\" <mark>hughes</mark> told the sunday star-times. \"we have got a new power to pursue compensation on behalf of investors and that power usefully applies to things that have already happened, so we can look back into the past and start actions on behalf of investors even though any [fraudulent] behaviour occurred before we existed .\" it will allow the financial watchdog to seek compensation for investors ripped off in the space of the last seven years. \"you would want to look at every case on its merits,\" <mark>hughes</mark> said. \"the usefulness of this new power is that it doesn't artificially restrict us, it doesn't mean for instance that we can only start to pursue cases in about 12 months time .\" the news will be welcome relief to long-suffering investors in the wake of a less than stunning performance by the current financial watchdogs. despite 17,383 hours of investigation time and $1,175,982 in costs, the serious fraud office has secured just three convictions in a string of high-profile finance and business collapses. the sfo boss, adam feeley, says he is frustrated and admits the financial watchdog \"can do better\". feeley's frank admission follows the release under the official information act of the cost of eight of the sfo's high-profile cases over the past year. the figures - spanning the period of july 2010 through to this march - show the eight investigations cost $1,175,982 and have utilised 17,383 hours of investigators' time. the most expensive investigation was that into the failed finance company, bridgecorp limited, costing $356,666 and taking 6175 hours during the nine-month period. bridgecorp was placed in receivership in july 2007, owing 14,500 debenture holders about $459 million. former bridgecorp directors rodney petricevic and rob roest will make another court appearance on tuesday in relation to charges laid by the sfo. ad feedback the eight cases that the sfo has provided financial and logistical costs about are: bridgecorp limited, national finance 2000 limited, five star group, capital + merchant finance, kidicorp limited, lane walker rudkin, south canterbury finance and hanover finance. the investigation into kidicorp group ltd was terminated on wednesday. feeley said the probe - which totalled 909 hours and cost $50,496 - had determined \"there is no criminal offending here, or at least there is insufficient evidence of criminal offending\". the figures released by the sfo show the ongoing inquiry into the mark hotchin-headed hanover finance has, to date, cost $95,871. as of march 8, investigators had devoted a total of 1214 hours to the inquiry. the cost of the investigation is set to skyrocket, with feeley saying it was a long way from being completed. \"it is the case receiving the greatest level of resource within sfo. it is obviously a major case and there is a lot of public interest around it,\" feeley said. \"we are moving with some speed with hanover. but what people think of as speed in the context of fraud investigations, it is months not days .\" feeley said the sfo was now preparing for a full review of itself, saying there were things it could do better and also more cost-effectively. \"i would be the last person to say we couldn't do better. and certainly part of our review of processes is to try to look at cost-efficiency,\" feeley told the sunday star-times. \"i am sure we can do better. the sfo operates on an annual budget of $7.47 million. it employs 32 staff members and works on about 30 cases a year, with an average cost of $249,000. a key change feeley is contemplating is culling the number of charges they try to pin on people .\" do we look at 100 different offences in a major corporate collapse? or do we pick out two or three significant offences that fairly represent what has gone on there and concentrate on those? \"he said .\" historically, people said we should investigate every crime. but i guess from a cost-effectiveness point of view, if we end up convicting someone and they end up going to jail for seven years, does it matter whether you convict them of five offences or 500 offences...the outcome is effectively the same. \"he also wants to share more resources with the plethora of other government agencies potentially involved in charging commercial crooks. <mark>hughes</mark>, who has already had preliminary talks with feeley, told the sunday star-times:\" i am fully supportive of that. i don't think the new zealand taxpayer would be too impressed if we were seen to be duplicating assets and wasting public money. \"my desire is that we, wherever possible, streamline and work co-operatively .\" the fma will formally come into force once legislation is passed through parliament. it has made it through select committee phase and is now just awaiting official sign-off from parliament, with <mark>hughes</mark> saying it was his understanding \"we would expect to get sufficient house time to get through by mid-april\". that might be delayed slightly if more urgent legislation was required to be passed following the
