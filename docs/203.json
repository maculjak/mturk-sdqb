shields state rep. chip shields will replace sen. margaret carter to represent portland's district 22. the multnomah county board of commissioners selected shields after an hour-and-a-half question-and-answer session. the public was not allowed to comment. in the original vote, commissioners deborah kafoury and <mark>jeff cogen</mark> supported candidate karol collymore, and judy shiprack and diane mckeel voted for shields. chairman <mark>ted wheeler</mark>, who voted last, chose joann bowman, which would have triggered a revote. but then <mark>wheeler</mark> switched his vote to shields after telling bowman that because she'd received just one vote it wasn't her day. shields was considered the favorite against collymore, an aide to <mark>cogen</mark>, and bowman, a community organizer and former state representative. they'd all been selected by the multnomah county democratic central committee from a pool of seven. shields will take over for carter, who resigned to take a job with the oregon department of human services. the commissioners faced pressure to strongly consider a black candidate to fill the seat in the district that holds about half the black people in the portland metro area and more black constituents by far than any other senate district. with carter's departure, just two people of color remain in the oregon senate, both republican. <mark>wheeler</mark>, citing prodding from constituents and several media stories and opinion pieces, asked the candidates whether race should matter in the board's decision. shield's, the only white candidate, was up to answer first, which drew some ironic laughs from the crowd.\" i do believe ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and diversity in general are significant, \"he said. if all things are equal, he said, they have a role. but he pointed out where he thought things were not equal between the candidates, citing his lengthy and successful track record in the legislature. bowman said:\" all things are not equal. we live in an unequal society. when i hear things being phrased if all things are equal, i wish we lived in an equal society, but we don't. what i can tell you is that when i walk into a legislative building and nobody looks like you. \"and collymore answered the question by referring to a tv show she watches about a white suburban mom who deals drugs from her home, but how collymore found herself afraid of the black drug dealers on the show. she said that says a lot about how others view black people and how black people view themselves.\" the only way that can change is when we start to integrate people of color \"into higher office, she said. yet shields received backing from several prominent community african americans, including carter's daughter. he brought some black supporters to the meeting and pointed to them and said how he has helped them. before casting her vote, kafoury said:\" this is the only district where we're talking about does race matter. that is a tragedy and an opportunity. i hope these conversations happen all across oregon and not just the north and northeast portion. \"shiprack and mckeel said it really is the decision of district 22 constituents and so they were going to cast their ballot with the democratic committee, which gave shields the majority of its votes. 0) {document.location.href =d. options

TRANSCRIPT: Thom Hartmann here - on the news...You need to know this. Over the weekend, House Republicans and President Obama hit a stalemate in fiscal negotiations, and the Senate moved on to work out their own plan. On Saturday, after meeting with the President, House Speaker John Boehner told his party that talks with the White House had broken down. So, Senate leaders immediately started their own negotiations to deal with the government shutdown, and the debt ceiling. But, now there are new disagreements in the upper chamber about what should be offered in exchange for such legislation. What started out as a fight over Obamacare, has morphed into a debate about the sequester, tax revenues, and cuts to Social Security and Medicare. On CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" democratic Senator Chuck Schumer explained the proposal, saying, \"The plan would be, open up the government immediately for a period of time before the sequester hits, and then have serious discussions where we might be able to undo the sequester.\" However, President Obama already rejected a similar plan offered by House Republicans. That plan would have opened the government, raised the debt ceiling, and replaced the next round of sequester cuts with cuts to Social Security and Medicare. And, it appears unlikely that Senate Republicans will accept a plan that repeals the sequester without equal cuts to another program. Republican Senator Bob Corker said, \"I just can't imagine how that has any possibility of becoming law.\" But, at least Senate leaders are still talking, and still working with the White House to find a way to avoid default. As the debate continues, the debt ceiling deadline grows closer, and Americans - and the World - want our lawmakers to end this fight. In screwed news...The debt limit fight has moved to the Senate, but that won't stop House Republicans from trying to insert a few demands into the deal. According to the Washington Post, Representative <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> said, \"[the] House could not accept either a debt-limit bill or a government funding measure that would delay the fight until the new year.\" That is, of course, unless Republicans are allowed to use the looming deadline as leverage to delay Obamacare, and deny women coverage of birth control. In a private meeting with Republicans, <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> said that the House should demand a delay in the individual mandate, and a so-called \"conscience clause,\" which would allow employers and insurance companies to deny contraception coverage. Although it's unlikely that Senate Democrats, or the President, would ever sign such legislation, women around our nation are furious that <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> even proposed it. And, they'd like him to answer - what exactly does women's healthcare have to do with the debt limit? In the best of the rest of the news...The people of Oklahoma will soon see a big drop in their electric bills. And, it's all thanks to green energy. That state's 100-year-old power company - the Public Service Company of Oklahoma - just signed an agreement with wind farms that are being developed in that state. The company purchased 600 megawatts of power, which was three times their original plan, \"after seeing extraordinary pricing opportunities that will lower utility costs by an estimated $53 million in the first year, and even more thereafter.\" Their purchase, which is awaiting approval from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, will provide enough energy to power 200,000 homes. In addition, just one of these three developing wind farms will create 200 jobs during construction, about 50 permanent jobs, and inject more than $130 million dollars into the local economy. The President of Clean Line Energy Partners, Michael Skelly, said, \"The Panhandle of Oklahoma truly is one of the mother loads of wind in this country.\" And it appears that these wind farms will bring a mother load of savings and new jobs to the state of Oklahoma. Another business owner is proving that fair wages and benefits don't stand in the way of success. In a recent op-ed in The Detroit News, <mark>Paul</mark> Saginaw, owner of Ann Arbor's iconic Zingerman's Deli, called for a living wage and benefits for workers around our nation. He railed against industry groups like the National Restaurant Association for opposing a living wage, and wrote, \"Our success at Zingerman's with over 30 years of operating and opening food-related businesses was not achieved by underpaying or withholding benefits from our employees.\" Zingerman's has joined with more than 100 businesses around our nation to form a new association called \"RAISE.\" The group is committed to taking the \"high-road\" of labor practices, and to proving that \"investing in [their] employees has been a driving force in [their] growth and success, not an impediment.\" And, Mr. Saginaw predicts that businesses uniting in support of fair labor practices will only lead to further success. He wrote, \"I sense we are ready for this change. Just as customers have voted with their pocketbooks for locally-sourced, organic and free-range products, they are voting for ethical employment by patronizing high-road restaurants.\" And finally...If you name a dog Houdini, you better be prepared for him to pull off a few tricks. That's what happened in Colorado Springs, with an Australian shepherd waiting at an animal shelter for a new home. The dog decided he was sick of waiting, so he opened his own kennel, two external doors, and went out to find his new owner. If it wasn't all captured on the shelter's security footage, the staff would have thought that Houdini just magically disappeared. Thankfully, a woman named Ashley found the dog wandering her neighborhood and decided to adopt Houdini. If no one comes to claim the dog from the shelter, he will soon go to his new home. Ashley said, \"We think he's a wonderful dog, and as much as I would love his owner to come and claim him...I can't wait to welcome him into my family.\" Hopefully, Ashley is prepared to secure her doors a little better so that little Houdini doesn't make another great escape.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks on before praying at the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray, in Jerusalem's Old City, Saturday Feb. 28, 2015.

But <mark>Kerry</mark> stressed that Israel was safer as a result of the short-term nuclear pact that world powers and Iran reached in late 2013, and he described that improvement as the \"standard we will apply to any agreement\" with the Islamic Republic. Officials have described the United States, Europe, Russia and China as considering a compromise that would see Iran's nuclear activities severely curtailed for at least a decade, with the restrictions and U.S. and Western economic penalties eased in the final years of a deal. \"We are going to test whether or not diplomacy can prevent this weapon from being created, so you don't have to turn to additional measures including the possibility of a military confrontation,\" <mark>Kerry</mark> told ABC's \"This Week.\" \"Our hope is that diplomacy can work. And I believe, given our success of the interim agreement, we deserve the benefit of the doubt to find out whether or not we can get a similarly good agreement with respect to the future.\" Netanyahu will press his opposition to a diplomatic accommodation of Iran's program in his speech Tuesday to Congress. \"We are not here to offend President Obama whom we respect very much,\" said a Netanyahu adviser, who was not authorized to be identified. \"The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers\" of the agreement that may be taking shape. The adviser, who spoke shortly before the delegation touched down in Washington, said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel \"does not oppose every deal\" and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one. The invitation to speak to Congress extended by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Netanyahu's acceptance have caused an uproar that has exposed tensions between Israel and the U.S., its most important ally. By consenting to speak, Netanyahu angered the White House, which was not consulted in advance, and Democrats, who were forced to choose between showing support for Israel and backing the president. \"I will do everything in my ability to secure our future,\" Netanyahu said before flying to Washington. Boehner said Iran's nuclear ambitions were a threat well beyond the region. \"We're not going to resolve this issue by sticking our heads in the sand,\" Boehner told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" He said Netanyahu \"can talk about this threat, I believe, better than anyone. And the United States Congress wants to hear from him, and so do the American people.\" The congressional speech also has sparked criticism in Israel, where Netanyahu is seeking re-election on March 17. He also planned to speak Monday at the annual conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. Netanyahu considers unacceptable any deal that does not entirely end Iran's nuclear program. But President Barack Obama is willing to leave some nuclear activity intact, backed by safeguards that Iran is not trying to develop a weapon. Iran insists its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research. The dispute has become more personal of late. Last week, Obama's national security adviser, <mark>Susan Rice</mark>, described the timing and partisan manner of Netanyahu's visit as \"destructive\" for the U.S.-Israeli relationship. On Sunday, <mark>Kerry</mark> painted a more positive picture of continued close cooperation. He said the U.S.-Israeli security partnership was closer than at any point before, and noted the large investment of American money in the Jewish state's Iron Dome missile defense system. He said the U.S. government has \"intervened on Israel's behalf in the last two years a couple of hundred\" times in more than 75 forums \"in order to protect Israel.\" <mark>Kerry</mark> plans to make precisely that point when he addresses the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday in Geneva. U.S. officials have often accused the council of being biased against Israel and inappropriately focused on the Jewish state. Officials traveling with <mark>Kerry</mark> said he would urge the council to take a more balanced approach. Associated Press writer Aron Heller contributed to this report. Lights, camera, blossom!

White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler was told on April 24 about an upcoming report by the Treasury's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) on the IRS practice, which an IRS official apologized for on May 10, triggering the controversy. Soon after she learned of the report, Ruemmler briefed White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and other members of the senior staff, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at 7a news briefing. Ruemmler decided there was no need to inform the president, Carney said, as the administration struggled to put a lid on the IRS affair which has become a major distraction early in Obama's second term. Carney defended White House inaction prior to the completion of the inspector general's probe, saying any intervention would have been inappropriate. In any case, he said, there was no urgency because the activity in question had stopped about a year earlier. Carney last week said Ruemmler had not necessarily been told of the contents of the TIGTA report, which found IRS agents had targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny based on the use in their names of key words, such as \"Tea Party\" and \"Patriot.\" Ruemmler was told on April 24 the report would address \"line IRS employees improperly scrutinizing...organizations by using words such as Tea Party and Patriot,\" Carney said on Monday. \"While we had an indication of the likely findings, until the IG finalizes his report, the findings and conclusions are subject to change,\" Carney said. \"That's why we had to wait, appropriately, until the report was publicized or published for the president to be able to review it and respond, as he did very quickly,\" Carney said. Obama fired acting IRS Commissioner <mark>Steven Miller</mark> on Wednesday and called the inspector general's findings outrageous. The report found no evidence of political motivation for the targeting or of any White House involvement. There was no White House intervention at any time into the contents of the report, Carney said. POSSIBLE EXITS As the White House fought to contain the political damage, two congressional committees were preparing to hold hearings on the report, with some lawmakers calling for the Obama administration to fire more people linked to the scandal. Lois Lerner, chief of the IRS tax-exempt unit, was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a Republican-controlled investigative committee of the House of Representatives, along with other officials. Lerner's apology on May 10 for the IRS targeting at a legal conference in Washington set off the furor. Representative Sander Levin called for Lerner's resignation on Friday, saying she had recently testified to a House subcommittee and failed to disclose what she knew about the targeting. \"This is wholly unacceptable,\" he said. Levin is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax law and oversees the IRS. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office on Monday drew attention to a Washington Post article that questioned Lerner's statements, including her contention that applications for tax-exempt status by groups had doubled during the time period in question. Republican Vern Buchanan, another member of the Ways and Means panel, last week called for Lerner to be dismissed. Joseph Grant, acting commissioner for the IRS tax-exempt and government entities division and Lerner's boss, said last week that he will retire. \"I don't see how Lois makes it. It's saddening to me,\" said Philip Hackney, assistant law professor at Louisiana State University who worked until 2011 at the IRS with Lerner. \"She is nonpartisan; I say that with great confidence.\" Lerner was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee alongside Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin, former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman and Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. On Tuesday, George, <mark>Miller</mark> and Shulman were set to testify before the Democrat-controlled Senate Finance Committee. As the IRS scandal as widened, Republicans have focused on what officials knew about the targeting and when they knew it. The inspector general's report showed that the targeting got under way in mid-2010. In 2011, Lerner was told about how the practice was being handled at a Cincinnati field office. She halted the use of the controversial key words, but lower-level employees by January 2012 had resumed using them. At a first congressional hearing on the matter last Friday, Republicans made clear they are looking beyond the IRS. \"This appears to be just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups and political intimidation in this administration,\" Republican House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp said on Friday. Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and top committee Republican Orrin Hatch on Monday requested documents on possible White House involvement and sought nearly 300 tax-exempt status applications delayed by the targeting.
