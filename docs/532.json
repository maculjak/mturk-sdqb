Demonstrators will place 60 chairs outside of the parliament building in Edinburgh on Tuesday to represent the number of lives they say could have been saved had the limit been put in 1999--when the parliament was first convened. Travel and environmental groups including Friends of the Earth Scotland, Cycling UK, Pedal on Parliament, Spokes Lothian, Go Bike and 20s Plenty, will join together as part of the demonstration, along with other campaigners, between 1pm and 2pm. My #saferstreets 20 mph bill has its Stage 1 debate this Thursday. Below are ten reasons why you should ask your MSP now to support the bill??--Mark Ruskell MSP (@ markruskell) June 7, 2019 Last month, Holyrood's rural economy committee refused to back a Bill seeking to make 20mph the standard speed limit on residential streets. It had been put forward by Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell with the aim of reducing deaths and serious injuries on roads. Of the committee's 11 members, eight MSPs said they were unable to recommend the general principles of the Bill, while three--<mark>John Finnie</mark>, <mark>John Mason</mark> and Colin Smyth--disagreed with the majority conclusion and argued that \"the current inconsistent use of 20mph speed limits is confusing and undermines road safety\". MSPs will vote on Stage 1 of Mr Ruskell's Bill at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday. Gavin Thomson, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said MSPs must take the chance to demonstrate they are taking action to tackle climate change. \"This Bill is vital to making our streets healthier and safer,\" said Mr Thomson. \"Our politicians have a chance to show that they're to take action to face up to the climate emergency .\" This means making our roads safer so more of us can walk and cycle safely, and leave our polluting cars behind. It is shocking that MSPs are planning to put the need for motorists' speed ahead of the need for public safety. \"In April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared a\" climate emergency \"at the SNP conference in Edinburgh. The Scottish government has also committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045--five years ahead of the UK as a whole. This morning, the Committee has published its report on the Restricted Roads (20mph Speed Limit) (Scotland) Bill, it concluded that it did not agree the general principles of the Bill. Read the report here--https: //t.co/vZWE14JmWi pic.twitter.com/kW2EnxMBVd--REC Committee (@ SP_RECcttee) May 31, 2019 Sally Hinchcliffe, from Pedal on Parliament, said that MSPs must explain what measures they will take to reduce road danger if they do not back Mr Ruskell's proposed Bill. Ms Hinchcliffe said:\" This legislation presents a perfect opportunity to make our towns and cities safer right across Scotland, eliminating the postcode lottery of safer streets for children walking or cycling. \"If MSPs don't want to support this bill, we challenge them to tell us what measures they will enact that would reduce road danger for vulnerable road users as effectively as this .\" Duncan Dollimore, of Cycling UK, added: \"Despite acknowledging the safety benefits of 20mph limits, the Scottish government seems to want to carry on regardless, leaving local authorities to decide whether or not to introduce lower limits .\" But had such a limit been introduced when the Scottish Parliament was founded, 60 families might have been spared the agony of losing a loved one in a road collision. \"They might ask, why won't their government lead and assume, rather than duck responsibility?\" 0 comment", "articleID": "2019061012_00247078_W", "names": {"John Mason": ["Q14945665", "Q1700987", "Q21077155", "Q21597927", "Q25344506", "Q27925051", "Q53953104", "Q6247048", "Q6247051", "Q6247057", "Q6247072", "Q6247074"]}}, {"date": "2019-06-11", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nascar/news/nascar-at-michigan-live-race-updates-results-highlights-firekeepers-casino-400/yi5p93lp0ynd1k31rdulh9zex?src=rss", "content": "NASCAR results at Michigan: Joey Logano dominates FireKeepers Casino 400, wins in OT Written By Thomas Schlarp Motorsports Drivers spent nearly the entire race looking at the rear of Joey Logano's yellow No. 22 car, but a caution on the final laps and an overtime finish made things close as Logano held on for his second victory of the season. The weekend could not have gone much better for Logano after the defending Monster Energy Cup Series champion won pole position in Saturday's qualifying. The No. 22 car capitalized on his prime track position and led 163 of the FireKeepers Casino's 203 laps.

Contact with William Byron and the wall midway through the final stage, however, spelled near-disaster for the No. 3. Dillon finished 26th.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was holding up a trade deal with China and had no interest in moving ahead, unless Beijing agrees to four or five \"major points\" which he did not specify. Separately, Trump said he would impose more tariffs on Chinese imports if there was no progress in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit later this month. Stocks were mostly higher in early trading amid lingering optimism over Trump's decision late on Friday to hold off import tariffs on Mexico. \"Trade sentiment is driving everything,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"What we're seeing today is the more pessimistic view on what might happen by the end of the month. Most selling in the month of May could be put down to China and Mexico .\" Investors also may be reluctant to push stocks higher without a fresh catalyst for support, some strategists said. Data showed U.S. producer prices increased solidly for a second straight month in May, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters, pointing to a steady pickup in underlying inflation pressures. Industrials and utilities indexes led the way lower Tuesday, with the S & P 500 industrial index falling 0.9%, weighed down by losses in United Technologies Corp and Raytheon Co.. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.17 points, or 0.05%, to 26,048.51, the S & P 500 lost 1.01 points, or 0.03%, to 2,885.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.60 points, or 0.01%, to 7,822.57. Recent optimism over trade tensions and the prospect of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve had helped stocks rally in recent sessions. The benchmark S & P 500 is just 2% away from its early May all-time high. The market is betting the Fed will cut interest rates in July and cut two more times this year as Trump's hard bargaining on trade with Beijing and others could push the economy back into recession. United Technologies fell 4% and Raytheon shed 5.1%, a day after Trump gave mixed signals on whether he believed the $121 billion merger between the companies should go forward. On Monday, Raytheon edged higher while United Technologies lost 3.1%. The S & P utilities index on Tuesday was down 0.7%. Symantec Corp fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded the antivirus software maker's stock, citing increased competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S & P 500 posted 53 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 88 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.76 billion shares, compared to about 6.92 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
