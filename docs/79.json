the monsoon drenches kolkata, hilsa, the silvery delight of a fish that tantalises bengali palates, is firing the imagination of chefs at restaurants as they dish out a range of delicacies, traditional and cross-border! steamed, fried, roasted in banana leaf, or cooked with rice as biryani, it can invade your senses in many avatars, especially the catch from neighbouring bangladesh's padma river that has as much appeal for the sentiments of people here as for their appetites. bengali cuisine restaurant 6 ballygunge place organised a bangladeshi illish utsav, with the fish locally known as illish. \"bengalis have a special liking for illish-based cusines, whether costly or not. the response to the festival was quite good,\" <mark>partha banerjee</mark>, spokesperson for the eatery, told ians. the hilsa is a sea fish that swims up to the river to spawn. during the monsoon, the rivers of west bengal are dotted with the fish. there have been concerns about the dwindling numbers of hilsa due to over-fishing, but that has not stopped bengalis from putting it on top of their menu. and never mind its many bones; they know how to negotiate it anyway. \"it's the queen of all fish. bengalis love it. bangladeshi dishes based on the hilsa are simply mind-blowing. preparations such as lauer pata diye ilish, dhakai bhapa illish, langka dhonepata illish, illish macher dimer ambol and ilish paturi are indeed marvellous,\" said dhurjay batbal, a hilsa lover. dhakai bhapa hilsa is one of the most famous dishes of bangaldesh. it is prepared with poppy seed paste. langka dhonepata illish sees the fish combining deliciously with coriander leaf paste and chopped chilis. \"the response to the illish festival has been fantastic. illish is a weakness of bengalis all over the world. we too offer various kinds of illish dishes,\" hindol basu, spokesperson of tero parbon restaurant, told ians. the innovation - laupata diya illish macher dhakai paturi or gravy cooked with the leaves of the bottle gourd - can be paired with illish biriyani, blending two different traditions of cuisine. illish maachh bhaja or the simple fried fish with khichudi brings back many fond memories of monsoon evenings, especially for those who left the then east pakistan - present-day bangladesh - when india was partitioned. generations have grown up on stories of the padma illish, with the fish continuing to make an appearance in many kitchens during celebrations. even those who don't have time to cook due to hectic lifestyles don't miss their date with the hilsa, thanks to restaurants which dish out an incredible variety. \"as many families are nuclear families, they don't have time to cook different kinds of preparations. so hilsa festivals are the best way to satisfy the taste buds of bengalis,\" added basu. some bengali cuisine restaurants also offer the illish thali. a thali ranges from rs.500-800 depending on the items included. for enthusiasts, the illish thali comprises plain rice, dal with fish head, fried potato, fried hilsa eggs, bhapa ilish, shorshe illish and illish macher chachra combined with chatni, papad and sweets. fall foliage, festivals

international film festival (tiff) here friday night in the presence of the whole cast at the city's elgin garden theatres, wowed the audiences with its artistry and fluidity. the film is kiran rao's directorial debut, with her husband aamir khan playing the lead role of a painter (arun living in bhendi bazaar). apart the bollywood couple, monica dogra, who plays the role of nri girl shai, prateik babbar, who plays the role of dhobi boy (zohaib), and kriti malhotra were also on stage. set in the mumbai monsoon season, the plot revolves around shai's feelings for arun and zohaib in the teeming metropolis. a beaming kiran rao introduced the cast to the audience before the start of the film. she said she was immensely pleased with her directorial debut and expected\" dhobi ghat' to do well. reacting to statements that the film was meant more for the global stage, she said indian audiences too welcome such films. it is not the first time that such a film has come out of mumbai, she said. kiran, who also wrote the script, called the story of the film delicate, and said she was pleased with the performance of her cast. recalling her most difficult moments during the shooting, she said filming the crowded eid scene on <mark>mohammed ali</mark> road during ramadan last year was one of those tough moments. she said she had to surround herself with five security guards and aamir had to hide his face under a helmet to reach the shooting spot near the illuminated mosque. for his selection for the lead role, aamir said initially the couple's idea was not to cast him because they thought that his presence will \"overpower\" others. but after a few weeks, he said, they had second thoughts. and kiran put him through usual tests before casting him, he said. amid laugher, the bollywood star said he was so impressed by his wife' script that he fell in love with her all over again after reading it. he said she was very particular about what she wanted from each actor. \"a wonderful film. i cannot believe that kiran is so talented,\" said indo-canadian physician atul tolia who came with his whole family to watch the film. \"it is wonderful to see a new idea, a new director, and a whole new cast. it is so fresh. while watching the film, i felt as if i was reading a gujarati novel. the plot unfolded like literature. i was also impressed by the pace of the film, it flew fluidly,\" tolia told ians. he was also very impressed by prateik babbar, son of the late smita patil, for his role. \"prateik is going to be a new star. you are going to hear a lot about this
