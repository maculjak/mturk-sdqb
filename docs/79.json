A computer-generated image of Bella was shared by millions on social media as authorities scrambled to identify her. Assistant District Attorney David Deakin asked the judge to set <mark>McCarthy</mark>'s parole eligibility at 25 years--10 years more than the minimum. <mark>McCarthy</mark>'s lawyer called that recommendation \"vindictive\" and asked Sanders to make him eligible for parole after 15 years. The judge came out in the middle of the two recommendations at 20 years. The girl's mother, Rachelle Bond, who also was charged in the case, was the prosecution's star witness. She told the jury she saw <mark>McCarthy</mark> kill her daughter one night after the girl didn't want to go to bed. <mark>McCarthy</mark>'s lawyer, <mark>Jonathan Shapiro</mark>, insisted that Bond was the real killer and cast a \"web of lies\" to blame <mark>McCarthy</mark>. \"There was no justice for Mr. <mark>McCarthy</mark> here,\" <mark>Shapiro</mark> said. Bond pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact for helping <mark>McCarthy</mark> dispose of her daughter's body. Under a plea deal with prosecutors, she is expected to serve less than two years in jail. The agreement calls for her to be released after her sentencing July 12.

January 11, 2018 Raymond Ibrahim Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the <mark>David Horowitz</mark> Freedom Center. PJ Media The so-called mainstream media's approach to and apologias for Islamic terrorism have become as predictable as they are farcical. In a recent piece titled, \"A Mysterious Act of Mercy by the Subway Bombing Suspect,\" the New York Times' Jeffrey Gettleman portrays would-be suicide bomber Akayed Ullah--whose foiled attempt at Times Square subway last month could have massacred countless Americans--as just another Muslim youth angered at and responding to the mistreatment of Muslims, that is, a Muslim with legitimate \"grievances.\" This is clear from the opening sentences: Before Akayed Ullah returned home to New York from his native Bangladesh...he had one last thing to do--an all-night bus ride by himself to help Rohingya refugees [Muslims]. After visiting relatives here in the capital city, Dhaka, he traveled across the country, slept in a mosque and under a tree, and passed out a few hundred dollars of medicine in the crowded refugee camps. \"When he left [America], he seemed happy,\" said his mother-in-law, Mahfuza Akhter. \"But when he returned, he was so upset. He said those people were living in hell, each and every minute.\" \"That lonely trip across Bangladesh in September remains a mystery,\" Gettleman goes on to opine, wondering whether Ullah was \"following his own heart, reflecting some sort of inner struggle as he headed toward his first known act of violence and self-destruction.\" Gettleman claims to base this \"tragic hero\" image of the would-be Muslim suicide bomber on \"extensive interviews with more than a dozen friends, relatives and acquaintances,\" all of whom (opportunistically?) say that Ullah was \"outraged by injustices inflicted on Muslims. He was also described by several people who know him well as loving and giving.\" According to Gettleman, such claims \"still leave a hole as to why Mr. Ullah did this.\" And so it goes. To anyone paying attention, the NYT's portrayal of Ullah is virtually boilerplate; the duplicate structure of the portrayals of all Islamic terrorists who strike at the United States. Recall, for instance, when <mark>Abdul Razak</mark> Ali Artan--an 18-year-old Muslim refugee from Somalia, who was receiving aid from Catholic charities--rammed his car into a building at Ohio State University, then got out and stabbed people with a butcher knife, hospitalizing some 13 people. CNN, NBC, the Washington Post and many others sought to rationalize away Artan's violence by citing one of his Facebook posts where he wrote, \"Seeing my fellow Muslims being tortured, raped and killed in Burma led to a boiling point. I can't take it anymore.\" The problem with both Ullah's and Artan's supposed \"grievances\" is twofold. First, the obvious: how, exactly, does terrorizing and slaughtering Americans make up for the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Burma/Myanmar? If Ullah and Artan were primarily motivated by the suffering of the Rohingya, shouldn't they have sought to terrorize and kill Burmese--not Americans? Secondly, while media and other \"experts\" routinely portray such Muslim terrorists as being motivated by the \"love\" they feel for fellow Muslims--as when former CIA Michael Scheuer described Osama bin Laden as a man of love, comparing him to Robin Hood--this \"love\" is itself another reflection of Islamic supremacism and the flipside to the Islamic doctrine of Loyalty and Enmity: just as Muslims are obligated to hate and fight non-Muslims, so are they \"obligated to befriend a believer--even if he is oppressive and violent toward you--while he [the Muslim] must be hostile to the infidel--even if he is liberal and kind to you\" (The Al Qaeda Reader, p. 64). Or as the Koran (48:29) more succinctly puts it, Muslims \"are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves.\" Simply put, Ullah's terror attempt is a byproduct of Islamic teachings that make the non-Muslim enemy number one, regardless of any real or imagined \"grievances.\" The reason Ullah struck the U.S. as opposed to Myanmar is probably because the latter has more \"draconian\" security measures that made America an easier target. Ironically, Bangladeshi authorities, who said Ullah \"was closely following several jihadist websites,\" come closer to the mark: \"He seemed to have this hatred for America,\" said <mark>Monirul Islam</mark>, the chief of Bangladesh's counterterrorism police operations. \"We're not exactly sure where it came from.\" While the answer is self-evident--the hatred came from jihadi websites that preach hate for all infidels 24/7--at least Bangladeshi authorities do not offer silly and sappy motivations such as \"grievances,\" which is more than can be said for so-called mainstream Western media and their nonstop efforts to portray Islamic aggressors as \"tragic heroes.\" Share"}, {"articleID": "2018011717_00788476_W", "names": {"Sung Min": ["Q12971420", "Q7640091"]}, "date": "2018-01-17", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3970362/kid-rock-nhl-all-star-game/", "content": "Kid Rock will headline entertainment at the upcoming 2018 NHL All-Star Game in Tampa, Fl. on Sunday, Jan. 28.

Tweeting from his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he is spending the weekend, <mark>Trump</mark> lashed out at the media for coverage of the disclosure that his oldest son and namesake held a meeting last year with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who offered damaging information about Clinton, his campaign opponent. <mark>Trump</mark> tweeted,\" HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media? \"<mark>Trump</mark> was referring to emails Clinton deleted from her private server as secretary of state, as well as to her campaign being provided an early look at a question in a primary debate against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The debate controversy surfaced only because of an illegal hack of Democratic emails, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was orchestrated by Russia, and their subsequent release on Wikileaks. In another tweet Sunday morning, <mark>Trump</mark> accused the news media of\" phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting. \"He said the\" #Fake News, \"the president's term for news outlets whose aggressive reporting he does not like, is\" DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country! \"Translator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.
