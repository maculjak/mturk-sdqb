Subscribe to our daily newsletter Sign Up West Mercia Police has increased its evening and overnight patrols in the town, as well as using a number of speed monitoring devices during the day, following numerous reports of cars being driven recklessly and at speed around Innage Lane and Innage Lane Car Park over the last few weeks. Bridgnorth councillor for Castle ward, <mark>David Cooper</mark>, said the area attracted bad behaviour and suffered significant damage, particularly to the 19th century Innage Lea building, following an arson attack in late 2016. \"Innage Lane has been subject to anti-social behaviour in recent years due to the age of it and parts, especially around Innage Lea, not being developed in recent years--something which is looking like it will soon change,\" he said. PCSO Mal Goddard, of Bridgnorth Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: \"There have been reports of cars being driven at speed and in an anti-social manner in the area of Innage Lane and the Innage Lane Car Park over the last few weeks .\" Unfortunately no witnesses have been able to provide the police with any registration details of the vehicles involved. \"In an effort to deter such activity, a number of patrols have been conducted during the evening and overnight, as well as speed monitoring during the day. This activity will continue to further deter such behaviour .\" Warning notices can also be issued to the registered keeper of vehicles being driven on public roads in an anti-social manner, which in this case is defined as being driven in a manner that is, or likely to, cause alarm and harassment. \"", "articleID": "2019043005_00238946_W", "names": {"David Cooper": ["Q1174057", "Q21466815", "Q21466821", "Q24005495", "Q24005496", "Q24682145", "Q3017703", "Q30602629", "Q5232549", "Q5232551", "Q57427555"]}}, {"date": "2019-04-30", "url": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/775597/leicester-hamza-choudhury-tweets-black-people-suicide-england-arsenal-news", "content": "\"I've learned a lot as a person in my early years as a professional--certainly enough to know that some of the thoughtless comments I have made in the past are both hurtful and offensive\" Choudhury The tweets were dug up the wake of the Foxes 3-0 win over Arsenal on Sunday, during which he made his first start under new boss <mark>Brendan Rodgers</mark>.

(AP) - A shooting that killed two and wounded four at a North Carolina university left students scrambling for shelter and prompted fresh calls for ways to keep campuses safe. A vigil was planned for Wednesday on the campus of the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, where the shooting on Tuesday upended the last day of class. The governor vowed a hard look at what happened in order to prevent future shootings. \"A student should not have to fear for his or her life when they are on our campuses,\" Gov. <mark>Roy Cooper</mark>, a Democrat, told reporters. \"Parents should not have to worry about their students when they send them off to school. And I know that this violence has to stop ....In the coming days we will take a hard look at all of this to see what we need to do going forward .\" Campus Police Chief <mark>Jeff Baker</mark> said authorities received a call in the late afternoon that a suspect armed with a pistol had shot several students. Officers assembling nearby for a concert rushed to the classroom building and arrested the gunman in the room where the shooting took place. \"Our officers' actions definitely saved lives,\" <mark>Baker</mark> said at a news conference. Two people were killed, and three remained in critical condition late Tuesday. <mark>Baker</mark> said a fourth person's injuries were less serious. Students were among the victims, but officials would not say how many. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department identified the suspect as Trystan Andrew Terrell, 22. He's in custody with charges pending. Monifa Drayton, an adjunct professor, was walking onto campus when she heard the shots. She said she directed students fleeing the scene to take cover inside a parking deck. \"I heard one final gunshot and I saw all the children running toward me,\" she said. \"We started to get all the children pulled into the second floor of the parking deck and the rationale was if we're in the parking deck and there's a shooter and we don't know where he is, he won't have a clear shot .\" She added: \"My thought was, I've lived my life, I've had a really good life, so, these students deserve the same. And so, whatever I could do to help any child to safety, that's what I was going to do .\" The shooting prompted a lockdown caused panic across campus. \"Just loud bangs. A couple loud bangs and then we just saw everyone run out of the building, like nervous, like a scared run like they were looking behind,\" said <mark>Antonio Rodriguez</mark>, 24, who was visiting campus for his friend's art show. The suspect's grandfather Paul Rold of Arlington, Texas, said that Terrell and his father moved to Charlotte from the Dallas area about two years ago after his mother died. Terrell taught himself French and Portuguese with the help of a language learning program his grandfather bought him and was attending UNC-Charlotte, Rold said. But Terrell never showed any interest in guns or other weapons and the news he may have been involved in a mass shooting was stunning, said Rold, who had not heard about the Charlotte attack before being contacted by an Associated Press reporter. \"You're describing someone foreign to me,\" Rold said in a telephone interview Tuesday night. \"This is not in his DNA .\" Shortly after UNC Charlotte issued a campus lockdown, aerial shots from local television news outlets showed police officers running toward a building, while another view showed students running on a campus sidewalk. The university has more than 26,500 students and 3,000 faculty and staff. The campus is northeast of the city center and is surrounded by residential areas. Spenser Gray, a junior, said she was watching another student's presentation in a nearby campus building when the alert about the shooting popped up on everyone's computer screens. She said she panicked: \"We had no idea where he was...so we were just expecting them at any moment coming into the classroom .\" Susan Harden, an UNCC professor and Mecklenburg County Commissioner, was at home when she heard of the shooting. She went to a staging area, she said, to provide support. Harden said she has taught inside the Kennedy building, where the shootings occurred. \"It breaks my heart. We're torn up about what's happened,\" Harden said. \"Students should be able to learn in peace and in safety and professors ought to be able to do their jobs in safety .\" ___ Associated Press writers Martha Waggoner and Emery Dalesio in Raleigh contributed to this report.

The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the crash that claimed 10 lives could hear from up to 85 Crown witnesses. PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo 0 comment THE engineer who worked on the Clutha helicopter the day before its doomed final flight had warned an\" accident is waiting to happen. \"Craig Booth, a licensed engineer at Glasgow Heliport, wrote the words in a handover note at the end of his shift hoping management would take heed, a court heard. Mr Booth told the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) he was concerned about the workload of engineers at Glasgow Heliport. The inquiry also heard that issues with one of the fuel sensors on helicopter G-SPAO, which crashed in Glasgow on the night of November 29, 2013, were recorded on November 24. However, the observation was made on a sticky note in the base's engineer diary, rather than being formally logged in a deferred defect log. Had it been noted in the log, the fuel sensor would have had to have been replaced within three days. It was not replaced before the Police Scotland helicopter's final flight. The inquiry, at Hampden Park, has previously heard that pilot David Traill would have seen five low fuel warnings in the aircraft before it crashed into the Clutha Vaults Bar at 22.22 pm. Any pilot, the court has heard, should land within 10 minutes of a low fuel warning but the helicopter carried on to other operations following the red warnings. The court was shown Mr Booth's end of shift report, sent to colleagues at 3.53 am on November 28, 2013. In it, he wrote:\" I am extremely concerned at the way we are having to carry out in depth maintenance on our aircraft at Glasgow. \"It is an accident waiting to happen!!\" Mr Booth told the court: \"I didn't think for a moment it would be an air accident. I just wanted my management to know how I felt at the end of a very busy shift .\" Gordon Jackson QC, counsel for the family of victim Gary Arthur, said: \"You put that statement in your report and that report would go to senior management. What response did you get?\" Mr Booth replied: \"None .\" Mr Jackson went on to say: \"It's a pretty strong statement. You might have expected at least someone to discuss it with you .\" And you did expect that, but it never happened. Did you do anything about that? \"Mr Booth replied:\" Circumstances overtook. \"Mr Booth told the court that to keep on top of his workload at Glasgow Heliport he frequently went\" above and beyond, \"working additional hours and was described as\" coming off work absolutely shattered. \"A technical log entry dated July 8, 2013, was shown to the court which detailed an issue with the fuel sensor in the main fuel tank of the Police Scotland helicopter. The helicopter had been re-fueled but the level of fuel shown on a display inside in the cockpit differed from the amount in the tank. Mr Booth's end of shift report of November 28, the court heard, also stated:\" Fuel contents after refuelling drops after a period of time in main tank. \"Main fuel probe in AO bin when if [CORR] we get time to change it .\" The court was shown the technical log from November 24 to November 28 where there was no mention of the fuel sensor problem that had been recorded on the yellow sticky note in the engineer's diary. Donald Findlay, for the family of victim <mark>Robert Jenkins</mark>, questioned whether the engineer taking over on the new shift, in this case <mark>Ian Taylor</mark>, would speak to Mr Booth to go over the details of any outstanding jobs. Mr Findlay suggested Mr Booth's note in the tech log \"didn't carry any urgency\" and was \"almost a suggestion\" that the sensor might need changed. Mr Booth said: \"It's badly written by me .\" Mr Findlay added: \"This is quite important to a number of people .\" Mr Booth replied: \"Yes, I know that .\" In the afternoon the inquiry heard from licensed helicopter engineer Andrew Bochel, now semi-retired but working for Babcock. He was the engineer on duty on the day of the crash at Inverness heliport, where G-SPAO landed twice on the day in question. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC <mark>Tony Collins</mark>, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, died along with seven customers who were in the bar, Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; <mark>Colin Gibson</mark>, 33; <mark>Robert Jenkins</mark>, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44.
