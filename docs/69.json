moment, he spoke truly. but the key is ensuring that the right things are taught and the right people learn. unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen. there is no need to rehash the events of july 16 chapter and verse. we all know about how the harvard professor flew into a rage of racial accusations and haughty posturing after sergeant <mark>james crowley</mark> appeared at his cambridge home to investigate a report of a possible break-in. we've heard that gates called <mark>crowley</mark> a \"racist\" and said he was being targeted because \"i'm a black man in america.\" we know how barack obama stirred the pot, saying at a press conference that he didn't know all the facts but then averring that the police \"acted stupidly.\" and we also know that it's a foot-in-mouth moment obama wishes he could do a groundhog day on, and that he fancies a beer a substitute for an apology. moreover, the obvious points have already been made. we know that the police were simply following procedure in requesting gates' identification and asking that he step outside his home. it has also been mentioned that, far from the police racially profiling the man, he and obama applied that technique in assuming that the white police officer was bigoted and/or acting stupidly. and, in keeping with last point, some of the boldest commentators even have hinted that bigotry may lie in the hearts of gates and obama. yet no one has thus far dared expose the pretense. i didn't need the gates affair, eye-opening for some, to understand the nature of a gates or of obama. immediately upon learning of gates' existence, i knew he was another one of the president's many, many bigoted men. and even before obama dared stray beyond the guiderails of the teleprompter and commented on the matter, i knew that another one of the president's bigoted men stared back at him every day in the mirror. in reality, i knew this even before learning of yet another one of the president's bigoted \"men,\" sonia \"wise latina\" sotomayor and even, actually, prior to being bombarded with the bile of his most notorious bigoted man, reverend jeremiah wright. i knew it for a very simple reason. for all intents and purposes, most politically liberal blacks are bigoted. if they buy into the entire package of liberal tenets, they are bigoted by definition. of course, we all know what is coming. many will say that i'm prejudiced for painting all the members of such a large group with the same brush. but let's note that \"prejudice\" in the negative sense denotes an unfavorable opinion about a person, group or thing that has no basis in reality. for instance, the wise latina had her foot-in-mouth moment when she said, \"i would hope that a wise latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\" however, if this had a basis in reality, it would not be a prejudice. so let's examine whether or not my assertion has that basis. i'll begin by emphasizing two things, the first of which will make it seem as if i'm being politically correct and the second of which will disabuse the reader of that notion. first, it goes without saying that there are blacks who aren't bigoted--they also aren't liberal. there are my two favorite economists, <mark>walter williams</mark> and thomas sowell; the man i want as president, alan keyes; talk show host larry elder; minister and head of b.o.n.d jesse lee peterson; and many, many others. between this ideological set and politically liberal blacks is another basic group, one epitomized by <mark>colin powell</mark>. while its members are weak sisters philosophically, it wouldn't be fair to describe all of them as bigoted. now for the second thing: even putting the keyes and <mark>powell</mark> groups together, percentagewise they are part of a very small minority. boyz n' the hood, the father character, played by laurence fishburne, gives a motivational speech about how the presence of alcohol and gun stores in south central l.a. is the result of a white conspiracy. note that he is cast in the film as the wise patriarch, a voice of reason. of course, this is hollywood, but it's also a case of art imitating life. we long ago learned about the surprisingly large numbers of black people who believe the aids virus is the result of a white conspiracy to wipe out blacks. and this paranoia also explains countless everyday interactions. for instance, some years ago there was the story of that public official who used the word \"niggardly\" at a meeting, and i the woes of illinoisan <mark>david gonzalez</mark>, who, replying to a query, told a black co-worker that a symbol he was wearing was a clan badge (scottish clan, a symbol of ethnicity). in both cases, the men were targeted by bigoted leftist blacks who were sure they were prejudiced. then there is bigoted obama man attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark>, who mentioned that he also was \"profiled\" by the police in this. now, i don't doubt that he believes he was unjustly targeted, but, then, i know something else: i've been \"profiled\" as well. i could tell you about a couple of incidents in which i was pulled over simply because i was in the wrong place, in the wrong kind of vehicle and, in one case, the wrong age. this, not to mention that i was the wrong sex--remember, the police view men much more suspiciously than women because, like some other groups, they commit an inordinate amount of the crime (note that the complaints of profiling we hear always involve black men). then there is that esteemed academic professor gates, who was sure that sgt. <mark>crowley</mark> was a \"\"racist' police officer.\" and there are many other such examples. now, why would anyone read bigoted motives into innocent things? it's not always a machiavellian playing of the race card, i can assure you. there is another reason. we've all had experiences with those who are prejudiced against an individual. it might have been a mother-in-law who just couldn't stand her son's wife, or a person who, after years of marital conflict, was fatally biased against his spouse. and when you thus hate someone, it's so often the case that you view him through colored glasses. his trespasses are then never innocent mistakes, are they? and are his errant comments ever just slips of the tongue? no, they're the result of evil motives, a desire to target you for attack. the thinking is, \"you know, that's just the kind of thing that scum of the earth would do!\" in reality, we'd do well to bear in mind that you should \"never attribute to malice what is better explained by stupidity,\" but the prejudiced person will never distinguish between the innocent and insidious. hatred is like darkness: the more there is, the less you can see. it is no different with politically liberal blacks. gates, aids conspiracy theorists, the niggardly-and-clan police and many others are just sure that those who \"offended\" them are bigoted because, well, that's just what white people do. also note that the demonization of whites is part of leftist dogma (i refute this). this was apparent even four decades ago when feminist susan sontag infamously proclaimed, \"the white race is the cancer of human history.\" and the idea gains ever more currency. in fact, i have encountered numerous whites who have expressed such sentiments, including a man online recently who wrote that he was \"ashamed\" to be white. yet, if such anti-white loathing is present among leftist whites out of a sense of being \"oppressors,\" how much more prevalent is it among leftist blacks, who view themselves as the oppressed? the answer is that it's common enough--and accepted enough--so that another one of the president's bigoted men, reverend joseph lowery, was given the podium and allowed to pray for a day \"when white will embrace what is right\" during obama's inauguration. oh, and obama didn't say he was sorry for that, either. it just seems that he only apologizes to those he considers then we have that old political observation about how blacks are actually quite conservative culturally. this evidenced itself just last november when 70 percent of blacks voted for california's proposition 8, which defined marriage as the union between a man and woman, versus only 49 percent of whites. now, while the phenomenon of black cultural conservatism is certainly exaggerated a bit, we have to ask, why would such a group vote democrat 95 percent of the time? the answer is race. there is a strong feeling in the black community that the republicans are the white party, which is no doubt why screaming howard dean this stereotype in 2008. and to rise above this--as alan keyes and the other fine gentlemen i've mentioned have done--is to transcend leftist politics itself. as for politically liberal blacks, the reality is that they are consumed by race. they live and die with it, eat it and breathe it. as an example, consider a certain affirmation black women sometimes utter to young black boys: \"you're going to grow up to be a strong, young black man!\" now, this isn't designed simply to reassure the lads that they're not going to go the way of <mark>michael jackson</mark>. there is another reason. everyone tends to define himself in some manner, viewing some particular status as central to his being. this should be \"child of god\" but usually is something else; it could be the quite wholesome identity of \"father\" or \"mother,\" or it could be \"policeman,\" \"doctor\" or \"athlete.\" then again, it could also have to do with one's group. in the case of most politically liberal blacks, they identify so closely with their race that there simply is little, if any, separation between them and it. as an example of how this manifests itself, consider congressman sheila jackson-lee's 2005 statement during a house, \"i came here as a slave; i now want the right to vote!\" now, just for the record, this woman isn't 175 years old. but was it just a manner of speaking? well, when i gave a talk about so-called racial profiling at a toronto symposium some years back, i took questions afterwards and one i fielded was from a black student. he began by passionately saying, \"there was a time when you and i couldn't drink out of the same water fountain...\"rest assured, it's not that these folks had a shirley maclaine vision of a past life. it is that identification. in their universe,\" i \"am the group; the group is me. anything that has happened to the group has happened to me, and any characterization of the group is a characterization of me. the latter is, by the way, one reason why people (of any group) exhibiting this phenomenon cannot abide any criticism of their group. their self-image is so intertwined with the image of the collective that anything diminishing the latter diminishes the former. this helps explain why such people will jump through hoops to rationalize away unflattering facts about their groups. it sheds light on why individuals such as obama can say that blacks get stopped by law enforcement disproportionately while ignoring the reason for it: they commit crimes disproportionately. the black person who has amalgamated group and self cannot acknowledge this fact because, in his mind, it would be tantamount to saying that he was criminally inclined. it would make him feel like less as a person. now, there is a funny thing about hang-ups. many of us have them, but we usually don't recognize them as hang-ups. we don't realize that our hang-ups are just that: things that seem all-important and ever-relevant because they're blown out of proportion in our minds and hearts. rather, we think they seem all-important because they are so. and here is the crux of the matter: because we believe this, we assume other people have recognized their importance as well and thus must also make them a priority. in other words, blacks who place race at the center of their being will assume that whites would, recognizing the importance of this factor, follow suit. this perspective explains a lot. it explains why a black man who hears a white guy utter a word that sounds vaguely like a racial epithet or who is asked to step out of his home by a white cop reads bigoted motives into the situations. it explains why many blacks, despite being advantaged by an affirmative-action society, believe they've experienced great\" racism. \"is it real or is it memorex? when you interpret all the normal bumps and stumbles of human interaction as expressions of bigotry, you certainly have experienced great\" racism. \"that is, at least in your own mind. couple the above perspective with the fact that many blacks are told from toddlerhood on that the white man has kept them down (just think of the kids in jeremiah wright's church), and it explains something else. we've all heard the leftist shtick about how only whites can be\" racist, \"which is based on the convenient interpretation that being so requires power, something only whites possess (untrue itself). of course, since\" racism \"was originated by leftists to facilitate their arguments, they can define it any way they want. this is why i avoid the term and instead try to use\" bigotry \"--i reject their lexicon. yet, this language manipulation is driven by something real, something substantive, and it harks back to what i said earlier about prejudice. you see, when you view the object of your hatred as truly evil (\"white devils,\" anyone?), then, in your eyes, your feelings aren't actually prejudice, are they? they cannot be because you will view them as having a basis in reality. in other words, you can't be \"racist\" because, by gum, you have a right to hate evil. and this is of course a common failing of man; other people may be wrong to hate, but, well, we're different. we have a reason to despise our bogeymen."}, {"articleID": "2009031200_00008707_W", "names": {"John Cook": ["Q16107263", "Q19325279", "Q19827849",

fades from view by alan r. elliott investor's business daily posted 3/11/2009 americans seem to be climbing back in their cars even as the economy continues to go in reverse. four-week u.s. gasoline demand climbed for five weeks before dipping in the week ended march 6, the energy information administration said wednesday. implied demand - gasoline \"disappeared\" from refineries and distributors for delivery to gas stations and other outlets - fell just 0.7% vs. a year earlier after plunging 4.8% in early october. \"prices have declined dramatically since july and maybe some of the restraints people had on their driving have relaxed,\" said american petroleum institute economist ron planting. that in turn has pushed retail gasoline prices up 20% so far this year to $1.938 a gallon. that's still well below the summer peak above $4. api's gasoline demand gauge rose 1.7% in january vs. a year earlier, the first gain in 12 months. planting said preliminary results suggest another rise in february. gasoline inventories have trended lower, another clue to demand, after building for seven straight weeks through mid-january. they fell 3 million barrels last week to their lowest level since the start of the year, eia said. the lower supplies also reflect refiners doing a better job of curbing their output to match market demand. the combined changes have caught the attention of industry watchers. but most still don't expect a genuine strengthening in demand until the second half of the year. and there is broad agreement that the numbers should be interpreted with a strong dose of salt. \"i'm suspect of the data,\" said larry goldstein, director of the energy policy research foundation. \"it's too early to be looking at a structural, fundamental increase in consumption.\" <mark>john cook</mark>, director of the eia's petroleum division, points out that the weekly numbers can fluctuate wildly, and tend to be revised significantly lower over time, primarily due to exports data. <mark>cook</mark> emphasizes that the numbers do not show direct demand increase per se. but he contends the weekly data gauges trends just as accurately as do monthly data. he says the recent improvement in demand is significant. \"the four week averages are telling us something,\" <mark>cook</mark> said. \"folks are back on the road.\" at the same time, oil prices have steadied at above $40 a barrel after a dip below $34 in february. opec has slashed official output quotas by 4.2 million barrels per day since september. other producers have curbed activity due to lower prices. opec has struggled to coerce cash-starved members to actually cut back to meet their quotas. crude prices started to make a move on $50 earlier this week. but they fell $3.38 to $42.33 on wednesday after eia data showed u.s. crude supplies unexpectedly rose 749,000 barrels. also, china reported declining oil imports. opec ministers meet sunday in vienna. analysts debate whether they'll cut quotas again. but forecasters continue cutting their demand outlooks. the eia said tuesday that global oil use will fall by 1.4 million barrels per day this year. bp ceo tony hayward told investors in london last week that he didn't expect opec's production cuts to cut into inventories until the second half of 2009. fuels specialist robert starkey of houston-based <mark>jim jordan</mark> & associates says the impact is primarily psychological, influencing short sellers and other speculative forces that have helped hold current month prices well below subsequent

keep all waste transfer notes for two years; and, most importantly, check that their waste is transported and handled by those authorised and registered to do so who won't end up fly-tipping it down a country lane. you can check if a company is a registered waste carrier by asking to see their certificate, confirming with the environment agency, or checking on the netregs waste directory website, where they should be listed. another important question to ask before employing a waste contractor is whether they will \"treat' your waste themselves, which basically means sorting, bagging or labelling it, or if you'll need to do this prior to collection. and if you don't want to end up with a mountain of card and wrappers in your backroom, don't forget to ask how often they will come to collect your waste. it's a question independent retailer chris pollard of barlby village stores in selby wishes he had asked.\" i used to use an independent recycling company to collect all the waste cardboard, but i dropped them after they started to become unreliable. the price of cardboard is incredibly volatile and when it was down the company just didn't bother turning up to collect it, leaving me with vast heaps in the garage. i now use the council's services. it costs just under \u00a3 1,000 a year, but they collect once a week without fail. \"most larger stores will have their waste collected on a daily basis, but for smaller businesses weekly collections aren't uncommon, meaning that an increasing number of retailers are also turning to technology to reduce the size of waste products ahead of collection. charles brading has recently invested in a baler to help with the cardboard recycling at his store, vic's in the isle of wight.\" after some of our bigger deliveries of 400-plus cases we can be left with a mountain of card. i don't have much space at the back of the store so the baler has been a godsend. it squashes all the cardboard into small blocks which are then collected by biffa. it's also great for getting rid of the poly shrink-wrap. i fill about six bins with it each week and the machine compresses it into a 2ft block, \"he says. chris pollard has an altogether more physical approach to the problem.\" i'm really into my recycling, but i don't use any of the high-tech gadgets and gismos to help me do it. you can achieve the same effect by getting into the bins and stamping the cardboard down. trust me, it's very effective! \"those retailers who are part of a symbol group will probably have their recycling needs taken care of, says costcutter trading manager <mark>adam walker</mark>.\" symbol group members can benefit from centrally negotiated terms with waste management companies; costcutter has terms in place with jbs waste and biffa. we also offer a full baling solution, with free collections of baled cardboard available throughout the uk. \"<mark>walker</mark> adds that epos facilities such as the group's c-pos system can also help in reducing waste by enabling retailers to better manage stock levels and eliminate over-ordering. one retailer who is taking the battle of the bins to new heights is andrew thornton. the budgens retailer is on a quest to send zero waste to landfill, and he's not far from achieving it.\" six months ago i set myself the goal of reducing the amount of waste that my two london stores sent to landfill, and today i've managed to get it down to just 6%, \"he says. all andrew's waste cardboard is collected daily by budgens for recycling. the rest is collected by independent waste management company cawleys, which uses the innovative process of anaerobic digestion (ad) to dispose of all andrew's food waste in an environmentally friendly way. food waste is broken down into fertiliser, and biogas (which is converted into electricity and heat).\" it doesn't cost me any more than it did when i used an ordinary contractor to take my waste to landfill, and this is so much better for the environment. \"but andrew's not stopping there. he plans to achieve his zero waste to landfill goal in the next few months when he launches the food cycle scheme (convenience store, february 5, p8). the initiative involves freezing food before its sell-by date and sending it to soup kitchens across the capital. and there are other ways to recycle, too. online business-to-business waste exchanges are becoming increasingly popular, and your\" waste \"cardboard boxes or crates could be of great use to your local school's art department, or to people moving house. you'd be surprised how much interest a poster in your store could generate. so go on, why waste the opportunity? useful contacts www.wrap.org.uk/business/index.html www.netregs.gov.uk/netregs/63197.aspx www.businesslink.gov.uk www.ciwm.co.uk /"}, {"articleID": "2015121615_00392170_W", "names": {"Mohammed Ali": ["Q16002506", "Q6854083"]}, "date": "2015-12-16", "url": "http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-ad18-Yemen-peace-talks-begin-as-air-strikes-end/", "content": "Yemen peace talks begin as air strikes end posted by in Morning Star World Houthis and government meet in Switzerland by Our Foreign Desk UN-BROKERED peace talks between the internationally recognised government and Shi\u2019ite Houthi rebels began in Switzerland yesterday as the ferocious air raids launched by a Saudi-led coalition finally ended.

Yemen has been torn apart by armed conflict pitting the Houthi rebels and army units loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh against the internationally recognised government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition and supported by the US, along with southern separatists, religious extremists and other militants. UN special envoy for Yemen Ismail Cheikh Ahmed voiced hope yesterday that the talks would \"mark the end of military violence in Yemen.\" According to the UN, the war has so far killed at least 5,878 people since March, when the fighting escalated after the Saudi-led coalition began launching air strikes targeting the rebels.

considering the closure of five registry offices across the county. currently, lincolnshire registry offices achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, but a report by the executive director of resources and community safety, <mark>pete moore</mark>, raises concerns about how the closures could affect this. the report states: \"there may be a risk of reduced customer satisfaction, negative feedback and the loss of staff morale, which may compromise the customer service excellence accreditation.\" further risks highlighted in the report focus on the foreseen loss of income for bridal shops and florists in affected towns if ceremonies are moved elsewhere. owner of bridal elegance on market street, spilsby, patricia fry, said: \"it will affect the business because we are the only bridal shop in spilsby and i don't really understand why they are closing it and horncastle.\" the white hart now has a license but it would not be everybody's choice and a lot of people don't have

tourism by facilitating ceremonies for holidaymakers'. spilsby registry offices, along with those in bourne, market rasen, horncastle and long sutton, have been selected for the cuts due to their low usage and poor cost effectiveness. the registry opens less than eight hours a week and conducts a low volume of ceremonies but could provide a significant capital return to the council if and when it

boston college freshman olivier hanlan couldn't follow up his record-setting acc tournament debut with a huge upset. the eighth-seeded eagles lost to no. 9 miami 69-58 on friday in the quarterfinals of the atlantic coast conference tournament. and hanlan - who was coming off a 41-point performance in the first round, a record for league freshmen - was held to 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting by a miami team that's built on defense. \"it's very difficult to come back from that type of performance and not expect one of the best defensive teams in the country to put you on lockdown,\" bc coach steve donahue said. \"i thought he handled it well, and i thought we played off it well.\" hanlan made 16 consecutive shots over two days before missing 5 of his final 6 attempts of this one for eighth-seeded bc (16-17). yet the eagles were in this one down the stretch and gave the top-seeded hurricanes (25-6) a serious scare. patrick heckmann finished with 15 points for the eagles, and his 3-pointer with 3? minutes left tied it at 55. durand scott put miami in front to stay with two free throws with 3:01 left, and shane larkin took over a few moments later. he came up with a key steal from hanlan, then buried a momentum-shifting 3 off an inbounds pass to make it 60-55 with 1:49 left. \"it wasn't just me who got the steal,\" larkin said, adding that kenny kadji was in on the trap and teammate rion brown made a heady play to save the ball. \"it was all of us.\" after brown swished a pretty hanging jumper with 57.6 seconds left, and kadji added a free throw to make it 63-55, bc didn't get closer than five points the rest of the way. trey mckinney jones punctuated the victory with a dunk with 17.2 seconds left. \"we just had mental breakdowns\" during the final 3 minutes, hanlan said. \"the little things hurt us.\" larkin scored 15 of his 20 points after halftime, kadji added 15 points and mckinney jones finished with 12 for miami, which shot nearly 70 percent in the second half while making all the plays down the stretch to avoid becoming the acc's first no. 1 seed to lose its tournament opener since 1997. and the hurricanes - who have won at least one acc tournament game in eight of their 10 seasons in the league - have larkin to thank for their latest escape. \"by adding shane to that group (of seniors), he adds an element that allows all of them to play better,\" coach jim larranaga said. \"he's so good at what he does. a lot of times you'll see (larkin) in the first half try to get the ball to (his teammates), and then the second half starts, he starts to pick his spots to attack and score or find the open man. we absolutely needed that.\" larkin also keyed the defensive effort on hanlan, who a day earlier set an acc tournament record for freshmen with 41 points in the first-round win over georgia tech. <mark>ryan anderson</mark> also had 14 points for the eagles, who had their acc-best four-game winning streak snapped and were denied their first semifinal appearance since 2007. they lost twice to miami during the regular season in vastly differing ways: the hurricanes romped by 32 points in coral gables a few weeks after holding on for a one-point win at bc. and for a while, this one looked like a repeat of that blowout - at least until bc dug itself out of a double-digit hole for the second straight day. after rallying from 15 points down to beat the yellow jackets in the first round, the eagles spotted miami a 21-8 lead before closing the half on a 19-4 run and took their first lead when <mark>anderson</mark>'s layup with 4 seconds left made it 27-25. that coincided with a brutally cold spell for miami, which missed 14 of its last 16 shots of the half against a bc team that started pressing the hurricanes and defending them with a zone. \"we got a little passive,\" larranaga said. \"we didn't attack the way we wanted to.\" bc stretched its lead to 30-25 on heckmann's 3-pointer 20 seconds into the half. miami eventually countered with an 11-2 run and took a 48-44 lead on larkin's deep 3, and things remained tight until larkin and the hurricanes finally pulled away.

Jul 10, 2019 3:12 PM by: Canadian Press CALGARY--Mid-sized Alberta oil and gas producers say their share prices have fallen so low that investors are starting to worry their rising dividend yields are becoming unsustainable. The irony is that his Calgary-based company has no intention of reducing its monthly payouts to shareholders, which it has hiked three times in the past three years, said CEO Grant Fagerheim of Whitecap Resources Inc. \"I think there is a disconnect (in the market),\" said Fagerheim on Wednesday after taking part in a panel discussion at the TD Securities Calgary Energy Conference. \"There is no risk that we'll be decreasing our dividend. If anything, we'll be increasing it on a go-forward basis.\" A company's dividend yield is determined by comparing its regular payouts per share with its current share price--when the price goes down, the yield goes up. Nothing else has changed for the company but Whitecap's share price has fallen along with many other oil and gas producers, said Fagerheim, a situation he blamed on worries about regulatory uncertainty and pipeline delays in Canada. Whitecap shares are off by almost 30 per cent in the past three months and its dividend yield has jumped from about six per cent to eight per cent as a result, much higher than its more typical four to six per cent. There's little reason for concern about cuts in payouts for many of the dividend-paying intermediate companies he covers, said Adam Gill, an energy analyst for Eight Capital Research. \"At US $50 (per barrel), maybe some of the dividends are a little out of the sustainability range but at a US $60 oil price like we're seeing today, a lot of these companies are safe and offering a pretty good yield,\" he said. CEO <mark>Tony Marino</mark> of Vermilion Energy Inc. says he is seeing similar investor worries as his company's share price fell by 16 per cent over the past three months, boosting its yield to almost 10 per cent from about eight per cent. He said a dividend cut is \"not something we're even entertaining.\" Enerplus Corp. could \"easily afford\" to increase its dividend but the low value of its shares--down 20 per cent in the past three months--makes buying them back and cancelling them a compelling alternative use for the company's free cash flow, said CEO Ian Dundas. The company reported buying back $35 million of its stock in the first five months of the year. It has regulatory approval to buy back an estimated $190 million worth in the 12 months ended next March."}]
