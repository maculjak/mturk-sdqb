in this case, the human journey of police and policing. depression and anxiety disorders - including post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) - are being recorded among police at rates higher than the national average. among rcmp members, mental disabilities now represent nearly half of all disabilities and i project that this trend is taking hold among police organizations across canada. a number of factors are in play. one is chronic job stress driven not so much by the risks of the work that police do but by the kind of workplace they inhabit. a second - compounding the first - is the embedded frustration related to the increased complexity of basic police work. growing demands range from the court, exponential growth of paper work, and autocratic managerial styles of senior officers who are also under the bureaucratic gun. a third is the accumulative effects of years of exposure among police veterans in their pre-retirement years to the horrors of everyday life they confront - everyday. a fourth, the hardening links between things like hypertension, no sleep, chronic pain and depression and anxiety. depression increases the risk of heart attack among police officers, weakens their immune system, and destroys the capacity to concentrate and relax. a vicious circle. these are not conditions of weak character, or human weakness of any kind. these are physical conditions with psychological effects. chronic job stress is caused by chronically excessive over-production of hormones, affecting brain function, blood flow and the health of the human heart. for too long, these conditions have been perceived as \"invisible\" or \"personal\" or even faked. all of this is plain wrong. in fact, using powerful brain scans, doctors can watch just how the brain changes among soldiers suffering ptsd and concussion-type injuries. we can see ptsd as it happens. we can see depression as it happens. and there is hope for the future. the neural signs of ptsd are not permanent and can change with treatment. a cure is possible. and through research now being done by harvard and mcgill in a joint project for the us army, a cure may be on the way. that said, clinical treatments for depression and anxiety are just part of what needs to happen. fundamentally, we need psychologically-healthy workplaces for police. i see clear evidence of embedded frustration among the rank and file. tremendously tense perception of senior management. gruelling doubts that the public supports police. these sensations flow into, through, and around the workplace of police and signal a public health problem right in the heart of our police community. managing the police workplace isn't easy. but its clear, a quiet revolution of management practices is called for, and one has begun at the rcmp. a transformation process in our national police force is underway. one of the stepchildren of that is a slate of \"principles of wellbeing\" to guide the future management of the rcmp. the focus is on member and employee health, wellbeing and employee renewal. 1. management practices of the future that promote employee and family wellbeing as an everyday cultural norm. 2. fairness and transparency defining how workload is assigned. 3. a priority on human relations in the rcmp workplace. a revolutionary concept in police work. members will be trained for this. the principles of wellbeing also set out a commitment to managing the distress of rcmp members more effectively. rcmp commissioner <mark>bill elliott</mark> launched an initiative earlier this year boldly aimed at \"the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and compassion fatigue .\" compassion fatigue. the heart of a police officer breaking again and again as he or she picks up the pieces of lives on the street, in the back lots and among families of every walk of life. toronto police chief <mark>bill blair</mark>, in a conversation with me, made it very clear he is committed to promoting the mental health of police. i serve on an informal, grassroots committee among toronto police members and advocates who are proposing a mental learning initiative. i am confident chief <mark>bill blair</mark>, who also serves as president of canadian chiefs of police association, will spread that message nationally. police chiefs are well-placed to lead a national mental health campaign. suicide prevention of suicide is a significant dimension of that. police experience its aftermath in the community and its tragedy among their own numbers. we rely upon cops for a lot and it would be more than timely for civic leaders, politicians judges and lawyers to help police navigate the mental health storm now gathering in law enforcement. police work is more complex today than ever. the courts demand more than ever. public expectations are climbing higher than ever. depression and anxiety among are growing faster than ever among police. this calls for a new approach to police health and safety - one that serves and protects the mental health of the men and women who serve and protect us.", "articleID": "2010041502_00040033_W", "names": {"Bill Elliott": ["Q22583261", "Q28457876", "Q862090"]}}, {"date": "2010-04-16", "url": "http://feeds.cbsnews.com/%7Er/CBSNewsNational/%7E3/UXP1TUDo7LY/main6400750.shtml", "content": "expired beer theft: crime or waste management? a distributor sent 1,500 cases of expired beer to the landfill on april 1 in two shipments. the first shipment was destroyed immediately, but the second, containing about 700 cases of budweiser and michelob ultra, was not.

enough manpower nor material to build a new state capitol building. other state agencies have their offices either in downtown nacogdoches, or on the sfa campus. politics are dominated by the successors to the pre-doomsday democratic and republican parties. the republicans tend to be conservatives appealing to the large southern baptist base in the region and make up roughly 60 percent of registered voters. democrats, making up 34 percent of voters, are found mainly in the capital of nacogdoches and in college station and have a more liberal, progressive view of social issues. abortion and homosexuality are two issues the democrats have pushed in recent years. independents make up the other 6 percent of voters, and tend to reject both the perceived (and real) far-right and far-left extremes of both parties. farming, ranching and cotton have been the biggest industries in the nation since confederation. though they will continue to play a big role in the local economy, it is anticipated that oil and natural gas production will ramp up significantly in the next couple of years. the east texas oil field, one of the biggest such fields in the pre-doomsday united states, has been dormant since 1983. tests by mexican and west texas petroleum companies are ongoing to see how much oil is there, and how many barrels of oil the basin could export over the next 25-50 years. west texas and mexico also hope to develop the abundant natural gas fields in the region. in 2010, west texan and mexican economists and officials are looking for ways to pour money into the region. they recognize that most people will need job training in the new, 21st-century economy that the two countries are trying to develop in eastern texas, and they will need to be able to earn money. the challenge is how to develop a strong middle class, and not have a third-world nation perpetually dependent on heavy government aid and private charity assistance. it is hoped that oil, natural gas, cotton, farming and ranching, along with lesser industries like the rose-growing industry being redeveloped in tyler, will provide a solid base for a strong eastern texas economy. barter became the de facto system right after doomsday and, until the reunion with west texas, persisted as the only way to trade and obtain goods and services. over the years, there were various attempts to establish a monetary-based economy. the longest-lasting was from 1994 to 2000, when the government pushed the u.s. dollar, and then the texas dollar, as the monetary standard. even then, nearly everyone used barter in some form or another. the texas dollar was abandoned in 2000. currently, the west texas dollar and mexican peso are the two currencies in use in the region. there had been no organized military in the country until its reunion with west texas. the biggest threats to the republic came from criminals and roving gangs of bandits, and those were dealt with by local law enforcement. the police departments for all 13 towns had an agreement to work together when necessary, and there was a provision in the eastern texas constitution for a draft of all able-bodied men in case of invasion. west texas military has a presence in east texas and is currently working to establish some sort of army for the nation. some observers believe the east texas army will be, if not in name, then in practice part of the west texas military. local law enforcement in each town is led by a sheriff, voted in by citizens, and responsible for appointing, oversight and training of deputies and other officers. in nacogdoches, college station and tyler, a police chief oversees the department, and regional deputies handle the duties a sheriff would in smaller towns. the texas rangers of eastern texas were responsible primarily for the protection of the governor and his family. their duties are currently being expanded to be more reflective of their west texas counterparts. the texas baptist convention, headquartered in nacogdoches, has by far the largest religious presence in the nation. an estimated 58 percent of citizens belong to tbc churches, and the tbc has long been active in national politics. the roman catholic diocese of eastern texas is the second-largest religious body in the nation, making up an estimated 28 percent of citizens. the diocese takes a neutral stance in regards to politics, but members have been known to side with the tbc-led\" conservative movement \"or with progressives. many hispanics are catholic, as the church has been part of their families for several generations. other protestant denominations and sects - pentecostalism in particular - make up 8 percent of citizens. 2.5 percent profess to be atheistic or agnostic, 1 percent have\" no religion \"and .5 profess other religions, specifically judaism, taoism and buddhism. sports in the so-called republic of texas (a group of small city states in the eastern portion of former texas) was described by a west texas military soldier as\" what might be if you took modern sports and transported them back to the old west. \"american football is played as it was pre-doomsday, although the type of ball the locals have been able to manufacture have forced the sport to become more of a running game than a passing game. helmets are a hybrid of leather with facemasks made out of copper, iron or other metals. baseball also is played as it was pre-doomsday, although the ball is more\" dead \"(which has cut down on home runs); home plate is made out of wood; and batting helmets are made out of cast iron, with primitive, cotton-based padding inside. association football, known as soccer in the region, is the third most popular sport. observers from west texas and mexico were surprised at the high level of play in the primary amateur league, and especially by the talent of midfielder clint dempsey, a nacogdoches native. the famous radio station at 860 am, with the call letters kvrt (ksfa pre-doomsday), now operates seven days a week, from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. local time. it broadcasts a mix of news, sports, talk shows, religious programming, music (primarily country), as well as comedies, dramatic programs and soap operas. west texas radio is working to establish three more stations in the region by spring 2010, and up to ten by summer 2011. telephone service has been established between midland and the governor's mansion in nacogdoches; west texan and mexican companies aim to have all government agencies wired by the end of 2009 and service to all 13 towns restored by fall 2010. the daily sentinel, based in nacogdoches, is the nation's newspaper of record. two universities reopened in the years after doomsday: stephen f. austin university in nacogdoches, and texas a & m university in college station.", "articleID": "2010041806_00028390_W", "names": {"Rafael Ramirez": ["Q2127006", "Q5442567", "Q7282286"]}}, {"date": "2010-04-18", "url": "http://chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/6963629.html", "content": "the article \"a load of debt on an empty dome; astrodome carrying as much as $32 million, an amount likely to haunt county for years to come\" (page a1, tuesday) was very disturbing, especially in light of the fact that the city will close its libraries on saturdays to save money. the current debt of $19 million to $32 million resulted from the harris county sports & convention corp.'s spending of $60 million in 1987 to add seats and luxury boxes so the wealthy owner would not move the oilers. this turned out to be a big waste since the team moved anyway to nashville in 1997. in addition, the yearly debt, interest and operating costs total about $4.4 million. so houston then builds another football stadium - reliant - at a cost of $449 million, of which only 50 percent was private financing. one wonders when the folks of houston will need to build a more modern stadium because reliant is not nearly as grand as the new edifice built by <mark>jerry jones</mark> in dallas. regarding your excellent article on the plight of the astrodome, while memories and nostalgia continue to run high, let's face it: the 40-year-old facility has lost its usefulness to the community and should be demolished. many similar covered stadiums around the country have already been razed. there should be a message here. it is ludicrous to think that in these times any developer or investment group is going to assume the monstrous $32 million debt. with a struggling economy, hotel occupancy hovering at 50 percent, failed amusement parks and financial lending marginalized for the foreseeable future, county officials should bite the bullet. the dome is doomed, so let's demolish it now rather than continue to soak the taxpayers for $5 million a year indefinitely. how many more years are county officials going to keep feeding this long-dead animal? remember when we built the astrodome, roy hofheinz told us we were giving the city a gift that would bless us for generations? now i read that we still owe up to $32 million, which will take 22 years to pay off, all while we pay $2 million more a year in maintenance (not allowing for inflation). you do the math. seems to me like we gave ourselves the gift that keeps on taking. how about we follow dallas' lead and just blow it up? we could sell lottery tickets to push the button. might even make enough to retire the debt. i'd pay 10 bucks for a chance to do it. hopefully the astrodome is now one step closer to its final destiny: being converted into a much-needed multilevel parking garage at reliant park. the outer shell should retain the familiar dome look that we all have become accustomed to seeing over the past 40-plus years. but the interior should be converted into multilevel parking with six to eight entrances spaced around the perimeter. the parking fees collected would fully pay for this conversion, and we would still have our beloved astrodome to view. we are about to build still another new stadium and saddle the taxpayers with a big part of the bill. yet in our city sits a beautiful stadium, billed as the eighth wonder of the world, and it is vacant. well, duh! why can't the dynamo work out a deal to use this great facility instead of building still another playpen for athletes? in addition to saving money, there would be a prestige factor in claiming the dome as a home. an alternative looms in the future, which is to eventually tear down this great facility because it costs too much to sit there vacant. i don't think anyone in this city wants this to happen. i truly wish that good common sense would prevail among the decision-makers. someone, please, exercise some leadership and lead the way toward making this happen. regarding your article about the outstanding debt on the long-vacant astrodome (another example of government mismanagement), perhaps a mere 32 of all those famous athletes who benefited greatly from their taxpayer-funded playground might consider a little public service and each kick in a million dollars apiece or so to pay off the debt. nah...never happen. it appears that after all these years and all those tragic deaths, the houston police department is still sending lone officers to deal with family disturbances (\"police: officer shoots man holding knife; officials say suspect held it to woman's throat\" (page b1, friday). the headline could have been much different. too many times officers have been killed or seriously injured at such events. one of the first things my training officer told me was, \"when you break up a fight, you frequently have to fight two people .\" to continue sending lone officers to such calls is dangerous. <mark>robert martin</mark>, retired hpd lieutenant, montgomery in \"some cross bridge to 21st century; others\" just say no' \"(page b9, april 7), thomas friedman makes two main errors. first, he assigns to president george w. bush the legacy of the reagan trifecta of\" tax cuts, deregulation and government-as-the-problem-not-the-solution. \"in truth, president <mark>bush</mark> met only one of the three - one short of even the meatloaf standard of success. under <mark>bush</mark>, not only did regulation increase (even in the financial sector - remember sarbanes-oxley?) but domestic discretionary spending increased at nearly double the level that it did under president clinton. second, he states that government should be\" incentivizing businesses to build their next factory in this country, \"implying that it is the government that should lead the way in deciding where we should invest in the future, using subsidies and special benefits to guide innovation. unfortunately, government tends to use such interventions to protect favored corporations from competition and to set up benefits for favored special interests. friedman is asking for politicians, acting on the incentive of being re-elected, to somehow predict the future and direct future innovation in areas in which they have limited knowledge and expertise. we've seen the result when we expect government to lead the way in\" building bridges \": we get a bridge to nowhere. comments readers are solely responsible for the content of the comments they post here. comments are subject to the site's about our ads

first call in their new home. less than a mile away from their old station, the firefighters moved into their new, energy-efficient station at 3010 lafayette road just after 1 p.m. thursday. for

firefighters better prepare for high-level rescues, state-of-the-art amenities including flat screen televisions, a new multimedia training/community room dedicated to the late george i. pierce jr., and much improved living quarters. the training room also will be available to the public for meetings and an emergency operation center. with five firefighters on each shift, <mark>murphy</mark> said
