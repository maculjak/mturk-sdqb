The beloved classic film is currently available for streaming on Tubi to coincide with the Academy Awards. Audrey Hepburn became a movie star when she won the Oscar for best actress in 1953's \"Roman Holiday\" --and there's no denying the icon is still inspiring Hollywood today. In the beloved romance, Hepburn plays a princess who runs away from her duties but soon finds herself falling in love with a journalist, played by Gregory Peck. Viewers were immediately \"enchanted by her combination of grace, elegance and high spirits,\" the New York Times reported. Hepburn, who also become a fashion muse, made her mark in both the \"50s and\" 60s, captivating audiences with films like 1954's \"Sabrina,\" 1957's \"Funny Face,\" and 1961's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's .\" The actress also became a special ambassador for Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, in 1988 and dedicated the rest of her life traveling the world raising money and awareness for the U.N. organization.

Garrett: It's funny, with that classic look, even big stars that often aren't known for their class, like Kim Kardashian, have borrowed from Audrey's looks before. That infamous photoshoot she did with the champagne popping over her holding the glass, that is actually inspired by Audrey Hepburn. I'm not sure too many people will notice that. She is the queen of the LBD, the little black dress. She's the one that doesn't show much but makes that look incredibly powerful and, to me, sexy. So, I think that she is a style icon that people borrow from every single day.

Garrett: I think that Audrey really understood what star power was. I mean in the '50s, you had Clark Gable, Cary Grant--it was always about the men. And then some women really stepped up in the spotlight, like Katharine Hepburn as well as Marilyn Monroe. They realized what star power was all about, and these women [held] their own against their male counterparts. [Audrey] had this demure look, a look that was very, very innocent. But it was a gaze that held so much power.

Garrett: The kiss! It's always so funny watching classic movies because they have to be very family-conscious with those sorts of moments. And I always love the fact that it's a very family-friendly moment, but they have a lot of chemistry behind it. [When it comes to classics it's] not usually about getting hot and heavy. It's about the moments that they share, and that's what you have in this film. So when it all comes together, that for me is the cherry on the top.
