Michael Crumlish, 18, of Lodge Lane, Collier Row, was sentenced at Barkingside Magistrates' Court yesterday after pleading guilty to the offence. He also admitted failing to report the accident and driving on a road/in a public place without due care and attention. Crumlish was driving a red Fiat in Gooshays Drive, Harold Hill, on October 10 last year when he smashed into a parked Renault Clio. Prosecutor Nijole O'Brien said: \"The defendant's vehicle overturned, landing on its roof on the wrong side of the road .\" Some witnesses saw him get out of the car, he appeared to have a head injury. \"Forensic analysis found saliva on the airbag, which was found to be the defendant's .\" A probation report heard at the court, in High Street, noted Crumlish was \"frightened\" following the incident. He \"simply panicked\" and left the scene. The report said: \"He is 18 years old, still very young and quite immature, and hadn't been driving very long .\" It could have been his inexperience that caused the accident. \"Prior to being given his punishment, Crumlish spoke to the court and said he regretted his actions .\" I'm just sorry for what I did, \"he said,\" It was wrong. I should have stayed in my car. \"Bench chairman <mark>David Cox</mark> said:\" For the failing to stop and failing to report you are going to receive a community order, because we believe it is serious enough to warrant it. \"Crumlish, who had three points on his driving licence already, was given no separate punishment for the careless driving offence, but his community order will run for 12 months - until April 9 next year. He was ordered to pay \u00a3 85 in costs and an additional \u00a3 60 as he received the order. He must pay this within 28 days.

The leaders' conversation Saturday at the Summit of the Americas in Panama followed a brief greeting and handshake at a photo-op. \"I have become convinced that a different approach is appropriate at this point in time,\" <mark>Harper</mark> told reporters in Panama City shortly after meeting Castro. \"We're at a point where an engagement is more likely to lead us to where want to go than continued isolation .\" It's a different approach than the one <mark>Harper</mark> has taken with Cuba in the past. <mark>Harper</mark>, who has had strong words about the communist regime, initially opposed inviting Cuba to this year's summit because it was not a democracy. He has also been a vocal critic of communism. He revealed that his views changed, at least in part, after the United States began contemplating a different approach to its relationship with Cuba. <mark>Harper</mark>, however, was careful Saturday to point out that more work is necessary on the Caribbean island. \"We are not by any means unconcerned about the lack of democratic space and human-rights abuses in Cuba,\" he told reporters. \"We've always been clear on that and we will continue to be clear on that .\" During the their conversation, <mark>Harper</mark> said he and Castro discussed the long-running relationship between their countries - on political, tourism and commercial levels. The prime minister, who also noted how Canada helped facilitate the December deal between the U.S. and Cuba to work toward normalizing their diplomatic relations, gave little additional information about his own chat with Castro or how long it lasted. \"We had a good and long discussion with the president,\" said <mark>Harper</mark>, who had never met Castro. The Castro-Harper discussion was overshadowed by the Cuban leader's meeting earlier in the day with U.S. President Barack Obama. It was the first formal, face-to-face talks between American and Cuban leaders in more than half a century. Obama and Castro sat side by side in a conference room in a bid to inject fresh momentum into their effort to restore diplomatic ties. Castro told Obama he was ready discuss sensitive issues including human rights and freedom of the press, saying, \"everything can be on the table .\" But he also cautioned that the two countries have \"agreed to disagree .\" For years, the Cuba issue overtook discussions at the Summit of the Americas, which it had never been invited to since the gatherings first started in 1994. They are held every three years. In 2012, Canada and the U.S. were the only two member countries to oppose Cuba's invitation to this year's summit. They faced criticism from other hemispheric leaders for leaving the Cubans out. On Saturday, <mark>Harper</mark> reminded his counterparts in a speech how Canada's played a role facilitating negotiations between the U.S. and Cuba by providing venues for their high-level talks. \"We also are pleased that all the countries of the hemisphere are represented here,\" <mark>Harper</mark> said in his five-minute address to the summit. The remarks mark a shift for <mark>Harper</mark>, a man who has railed against communism. Last year, <mark>Harper</mark> called communism a \"poisonous ideology\" with \"ruthless practices that slowly bled into countries around the world, on almost every continent .\" He made the comments in a speech at a Toronto fundraiser for a controversial victims of communism memorial that will be erected in Ottawa. On Saturday, <mark>Harper</mark>'s address was mostly dedicated to outlining his government's goals for the hemisphere, including the promotion of human rights, security and prosperity. The prime minister told fellow political leaders that democracy is growing in the Americas as never before. <mark>Harper</mark> insisted, however, that more effort was needed to build on the progress. He also used the summit to build bridges \u00e2 \u20ac \"or mend fences \u00e2 \u20ac\" with regional leaders in one-on-one talks. On Saturday, <mark>Harper</mark> met with Obama, who has a strained relationship with Ottawa following his opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. Canada has also had a chillier friendship with Mexico ever since it tightened visa requirements for Mexican visitors. Comments on this story are pre-moderated and approval times may vary.

Nyia Parler left her 21-year-old son - who is quadriplegic and has cerebral palsy - lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair and Bible while she left town, police said. He was found Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he was left there between the time he and his mother were seen together on Easter Sunday and before his mother boarded a bus Monday for Maryland to visit her boyfriend, said Lt. Walker said the victim was found was around the corner from their home and described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place this way:\" She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away. \"During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was\" completely defenseless \"in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said .\" It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing, \"he said. Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said .\" Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful, \"he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and\" was in shock when he learned what happened, \"Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now the care of other family relatives, Walker said. Parler, 41, of Philadelphia, will face charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police. Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Maryland authorities said Parler was admitted to a hospital Sunday morning for treatment of an undisclosed condition .\" When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition, \"Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police told the newspaper. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving .\" He seemed to be a little happier yesterday, \"Walker said .\" You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. \"Dear Abby: Friendly divorce may be best for unhappy wife Emotional memorial for pedestrian killed in S.F. car chase Actor <mark>Ryan Reynolds</mark> hit, not injured, by car in Vancouver Consumer Reports survey identifies cheapest, most expensive...4-year-old's tip leads to discovery of her parent's bodies Activate!
