global patent settlement and 10-year licensing agreement that ends one of the first major conflagrations of the smartphone patent wars. apple sued htc in 2010, accusing the taiwanese handset company of infringing on the iphone maker's patented technology. it was apple's first major legal salvo against a manufacturer that used google's android operating system. though apple and htc did not disclose specific terms of the deal. in a joint statement, apple chief executive <mark>tim cook</mark> said he was glad to reach a settlement. \"we will continue to stay laser focused on product innovation,\" <mark>cook</mark> said. htc chief executive <mark>peter chou</mark> said his company was pleased to resolve the dispute so it could \"focus on innovation instead of litigation .\" since apple first sued htc, its smartphone patent war has engulfed competitors like samsung electronics co ltd and google's motorola mobility unit. the iphone maker won a $1.05 billion verdict against samsung in august, while litigation against motorola has failed to produce any decisive wins. however, apple had the most success against htc when it came to using litigation to actually disrupt the flow of products into the crucial us market. late last year, the us international trade commission ruled that htc had infringed upon one of four patents apple had disputed and imposed a sales ban on some of the taiwanese maker's phones. though htc said it had devised a technical workaround to apple's patents, the company announced in may that shipments of its phones were being held up by u.s. customs officials. once one of the industry's high flyers, htc has been badly hit by competition from apple and samsung. last month htc forecast a 14.5% fall in revenue in the fourth quarter from the third, worse than analyst forecasts and the second straight quarterly decline this year."}, {"articleID": "2010040818_00152760_W", "names": {"Dan David": ["Q19958347", "Q5213354"], "Shimon Peres":

cultural boycott initiative (pacbi) has issued a statement encouraging margaret atwood not to accept the <mark>dan david</mark> prize, which is based at tel aviv university (tau). the pacbi statement is reproduced below. at the same time, the palestinian students campaign for the academic boycott of israel (pscabi) issued an open letter from students in gaza urging atwood not to stand on the wrong side of history. this letter was endorsed by the university teachers' association in palestine. as the pacbi statement concludes, we at caia are also appealing to atwood's: \"sense of justice and moral consistency, we hope that, until israel fully abides by international law, you shall treat it exactly as most of the world treated racist south africa, or indeed any other state that legislates and practices apartheid: a pariah state. only then can there be a real chance for a just peace in harmony with international law and based on equal human rights for all, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or other identity considerations. we urge you to reject the prize and to refuse to participate in a ceremony presided over by the head of a state accused of war crimes and other serious violations of international law .\" the bullet presents here the pacbi statement, a call from besieged gaza, and an article on the recent move by montreal artists to join the cultural boycott of israel campaign. from apartheid israel pacbi the palestinian community of writers and intellectuals is highly disappointed by your decision to accept the <mark>dan david</mark> prize, which is based at tel aviv university (tau). your writings exhibit a sophisticated understanding of colonialism, structures of political power and oppression, yet your visit to israel comes just over one year after its bloody assault on the occupied gaza strip during which it killed and injured thousands of palestinian civilians and caused massive destruction to homes, schools, mosques, hospitals, factories, un buildings, agricultural fields and infrastructure. in this light, your acceptance of a prize administered by tel aviv university and awarded in the presence of the israeli president <mark>shimon peres</mark> can only be interpreted by palestinian civil society as complicity in whitewashing israel's crimes, colonization and system of apartheid. your vast literary portfolio will forever be attached to the draconian machine of israeli colonial and racist policy. last summer, following the assault on gaza, the israeli government announced a new effort to \"rebrand' israel in the eyes of the world as a liberal nation enjoying membership in the western club of democracies. in addition to the various forms of cultural outreach designed to highlight israel's achievements, this effort included inviting more writers and artists to israel in order to show the\" civilised' side of israel and help cover up the reality of occupation and the brutal treatment of the palestinians. your appearance in israel would lend itself to this well-oiled campaign to whitewash israel's grave violations of international law and basic human rights. above everything else, it would serve to deflect attention away from israel's three forms of oppression against the palestinian people: the legalized and institutionalized system of racial discrimination against the palestinian citizens of israel; the military occupation of the west bank, including east-jerusalem and the gaza strip; and the continuous denial of the palestinian refugees' un-sanctioned right to return to their homes and to receive just reparations. these efforts cannot disguise the dark side of the story, the 43 years of an increasingly brutal military occupation, during which israel systematically colonized palestinian land with the goal of gradually emptying it of its original inhabitants in order to use it for the benefit of jewish settlers. despite the \"peace process\" which began years ago, israel routinely violates the palestinians' most fundamental human rights with impunity, as documented by local and international human rights organisations. israel extra-judicially kills palestinian leaders and activists; keeps over 9,000 palestinians imprisoned, including numerous members of parliament; subjects all palestinians under occupation to daily humiliation, intimidation and military violence; and continues to construct and expand its colonial wall, declared illegal by the international court of justice (icj) at the hague in july 2004. tel aviv university, the institution administering this award, as other israeli academic institutions, is notorious for its deep and well documented collaboration with the israeli military and intelligence establishment, its racially exclusivist university policy toward palestinian citizens of israel, and its refusal to acknowledge its past and to commemorate the destroyed palestinian village on which grounds it was built. a comprehensive report by the palestine society at the school of oriental and african studies (soas) presents strong evidence of intensive, purposive and open institutional cooperation of tau with the israeli military establishment. tau must therefore be condemned for providing cross-departmental legal, technological and strategic support for maintaining and deepening the israeli occupation by assisting ongoing lethal assaults on the occupied palestinian territories and by defending and justifying israel's occupation policies. . these policies are implicitly and explicitly supported by tau's law faculty which appointed an israeli army colonel, pnina sharvit-baruch, to its staff recently. as the army's principal international law counsel sharvit-baruch is responsible for green-lighting the decision to target civilian infrastructure and for a \"relaxing of the rules of engagement' regarding civilians on the army's international law division. the soas report points out:\" ...(t) here is nothing unique about state institutions being implicated in the pursuit of state objectives, including security-related objectives. the tense military mobilisation of jewish-israeli society, its constant-war footing, and the closely related knowledge of circles which compose the defence research and development community in this comparatively small country, together amplify the role played by academic institutions in military affairs. tau, as the largest university in israel, is, unremarkably, at the centre of this militarization.... ultimately,...this collusion with the military amounts to the commissioning of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \"with the <mark>dan david</mark> prize allegedly aiming\" to foster universal values of...justice, democracy and progress and to promote the...humanistic achievements that advance and improve our world \"tel aviv university is only attempting to distract from its criminal record. the boycott divestment and sanctions (bds) national committee recently stated that\" palestine today has become the test of our indispensible morality and common humanity. \"in the face of decades of unrelenting oppression, palestinian civil society has called upon supporters of the struggle for freedom and justice throughout the world to take a stand and heed our call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against israel until it recognises palestinian rights and fully complies with international law. many prominent international cultural figures including <mark>john berger</mark>, ken loach, <mark>arundhati roy</mark>, roger waters, <mark>john williams</mark>, among others, have declared their support for the boycott. other renowned international artists, including sting, bono, snoop dog, jean luc goddard and joan manuel serrat have also heeded our call and cancelled their gigs or participation in festivals in israel (see in conclusion, and appealing to your sense of justice and moral consistency, we hope that, until israel fully abides by international law, you shall treat it exactly as most of the world treated racist south africa, or indeed any other state that legislates and practices apartheid: a pariah state. only then can there be a real chance for a just peace in harmony with international law and based on equal human rights for all, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or other identity considerations. we urge you to reject the prize and to refuse to participate in a ceremony presided over by the head of a state accused of war crimes and other serious violations of international law. palestinian campaign for the academic & cultural boycott of israel (pacbi) was launched in ramallah in april 2004 by a group of palestinian academics and intellectuals to join the growing international boycott movement. this statement was published on their website an open letter to margaret atwood from gaza: don't stand on the wrong side of history dear ms. atwood, we are students from gaza representing more than 10 academic institutions therein. our grandparents are refugees who were expelled from their homes in the 1948 nakba. they still have their keys locked up in their closets and will pass them on to their children, our parents. many of us have lost our fathers, some of us have lost our mothers, and some of us lost both in the last israeli aggression against civilians in gaza. others still lost a body part from the flesh-burning white phosphorous that israel used, and are now permanently physically challenged. most of us lost our homes, and are now living in tents, as israel refuses to allow basic construction materials into gaza. and most of all, we are all still living in what has come to be a festering sore on humanity's conscience - the brutal, hermetic, medieval siege that israel is perpetrating against us, the 1.5 million palestinians of the gaza strip. many of us have encountered your writing during our university studies. although your books are not available in gaza - because israel does not allow books, paper, and other stationary in - we are familiar with your leftist, feminist, overtly political writing. and most of all, we are aware of your strong stance against apartheid. you admirably supported sanctions against apartheid south africa and called for resistance against all forms of oppression. now, we have heard that you are to receive a prize this spring at tel aviv university (tau). we, the students of besieged gaza, urge you not to go. as our professors, teachers and anti-apartheid comrades used to tell us, there was no negotiation with the brutal racist regime of south africa. nor was there much communication. just one word: boycott. you must be aware that israel was a sister state to the apartheid regime before 1994. many south african anti-apartheid heroes, including nelson mandela and archbishop <mark>desmond tutu</mark>, have described israel's oppression as apartheid. some describe israeli settler-colonialism and occupation as surpassing apartheid's evil. f-16s, f-15s, f-35s, apache helicopters, merkava tanks, and white phosphorous were not used against black townships. ms. atwood, in the gaza concentration camp, students who have been awarded scholarships to universities abroad are prevented, every year, from pursuing their hard-earned opportunity for academic achievement. within the gaza strip, those seeking an education are limited by increasing poverty rates and a scarcity of fuel for transportation, both of which are direct results of israel's medieval siege. what is tau's position vis-\u00e3 - vis this form of illegal collective punishment, described by richard falk, the un special rapporteur on palestinian human rights in the occupied territories, as a\" prelude to genocide? \"not a single word of condemnation has been heard from any israeli academic institution! participating in normal relations with tel aviv university is giving tacit approval to its racially exclusive policy toward palestinian citizens of israel. we are certain you would hate to support an institution that upholds so faithfully the apartheid system of its state. tel aviv university has a long and well-documented history of collaboration with the israeli military and intelligence services. this is particularly shameful after israel's bloody military assault against the occupied gaza strip, which, according to leading international and local human rights organizations, left over 1,440 palestinians dead and 5380 injured. we are certain you would hate to support an institution that supports a military apparatus that murdered over 430 children. by accepting the prize at tel aviv university, you will be indirectly giving a slight and inadvertent nod to israel's policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide. this university has refused to commemorate the destroyed palestinian village on which it was built. that village is called sheikh muwanis, and it no longer exists as a result of israel's confiscation. its people have been expelled. let us remember the words of archbishop desmund <mark>tutu</mark>:\" if you choose to be neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. \"as such, we call upon you to say no to neutrality, no to being on the fence, no to normalization with apartheid israel, not after the blood of more than 400 children has been spilt! no to occupation, repression, settler colonialism, settlement expansion, home demolition, land expropriation and the system of discrimination against the indigenous population of palestine, and no to the formation of bantustans in the west bank and the gaza strip! just as every citizen knew that s/he had a moral responsibility to boycott apartheid in south africa after the sharpeville massacre, gaza 2009 was the world's wake-up call. all of israel's academic institutions are state-run and state-funded. to partake of any of their prizes or to accept any of their blandishments is to uphold their heinous political actions. israel has continually violated international law in defiance of the world. it is illegally occupying palestinian land. it continues its aggression against the palestinian people. israel denies palestinians all of the democratic liberties it so proudly, fictitiously flaunts. israel is an apartheid regime that denies palestinian refugees their right of return as sanctioned by un resolution 194. attending the symposium would violate the unanimously endorsed palestinian civil society call for boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (bds) against israel. this call is also directed toward international activists, artists, and academics of conscience, such as you. we are certain that you would love to be a part of the noble struggle against the apartheid, colonization and occupation that the palestinian people have been subjected to for the past 61 years, a struggle that is ongoing. ms. atwood, we consider you to be what the late edward said called an\" oppositional intellectual. \"as such, and given our veneration of your work, we would be both emotionally and psychologically wounded to see you attend the symposium. you are a great woman of words, of that we have no doubt. but we think you would agree, too, that actions speak louder than words. we all await your decision. besieged gaza the palestinian students' campaign for the academic boycott of israel (pscabi) endorsed by the university teachers' association in palestine"}, {"articleID": "2018101223_00382859_W", "names": {"Jack Davies": ["Q25171802", "Q6112030"], "Harry Kane":

Mandzukic retired from international duty following his country's run to the World Cup final and Croatia have scored just one goal in three matches since, the latest of which was a 0-0 draw against England on Friday. That result followed a 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Spain but coach Dalic is focusing on the future, rather than dwelling on the past. \"It is not like us not to be able to score two matches in a row,\" he said. \"But we have to forget Mandzukic, it is over, he is not with us anymore .\" He made his decision and we have to respect that and look for other solutions. \"Croatia rode their luck at times in a match that was played behind closed doors as punishment for a swastika that was marked on the pitch ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy. England hit the woodwork twice through Eric Dier and <mark>Harry Kane</mark>, while Marcus Rashford squandered two golden opportunities in the second half .\" It was a tough game, as we expected. We were compact and aggressive, better than in last match, \"said Dalic .\" It was not easy to come back after such a big defeat.

Tester spoke at the 8 a.m. educator's conference and introduced a new bill he says will encourage teachers to teach in rural America. That bill, the Rural Educator Support and Training (REST) Act, will provide scholarships to college students who commit to teach in a rural school for at least five years, as well as provide student loan forgiveness to teachers working in rural schools for five years or more. \"I think that this incentive will allow people to be able to go into rural areas in this country, and most of Montana is rural, to teach in some of those rural schools where we need more teachers,\" Tester said Thursday. Tester said the bill will also help this generation of students receive a better education in this economy. \"As with anywhere in the country, I think that public education is so critically important to our democracy and our economy,\" Tester said. Before Thursday's conference at Skyview, Senator Tester met with Wake Up Montana's Melinda Lee to discuss the bill he planned to introduce in the video above. Next, Tester said he plans to formally introduce the bill next week and hopes to gather co-sponsors. He said even if the bill is added as an amendment to another bill, the key is sparking discussion about education in rural America. \"As long as we get a good debate on the issue and talk about the challenges in rural America when it comes to education and teaching our kids, then I think we'll get a very positive outcome .\" Updated: Thursday, October 15 2015 2:19 PM EDT2015-10-15 18:19:16 GMTThursday morning's WEA-WFT Conference at Skyview High School brought Senator Jon Testor to the Magic City.

Winifred Kagwa Scholarship award from Heather Murray, former Hampton School principal. The ceremony was held at Bull Savannah Primary School in St Elizabeth on September 8. BULL SAVANNAH, St Elizabeth: Twelve past students of Bull Savannah Primary School in St Elizabeth received more than $1 million in scholarship money from the G. Winifred Brown Kagwa Scholarship programme and the American Friends of Jamaica on Friday September 8, at an awards ceremony at the school. The students are from the parish of St Elizabeth and have consistently excelled both academically and in their community activities. The scholarship was launched earlier that day at a luncheon in honour of the recipients. Eight students who are attending high schools in Manchester and St Elizabeth received $65,000 each and four tertiary students received the sum of $125,000. In a message, which was read to the scholarship recipients, Jamaica's ambassador to the United States and founder of Jamaica's Promise Foundation, Audrey Marks, reminded them that no matter how humble their beginnings, they can achieve greatness through hard work and determination. \"Remember that whether you work for someone or yourself, do your best. Learn all you can about your future career, pursue your passion, avoid negative critics, and most importantly, in today's technologically advanced world, protect your intellectual property. It is also important to give back to someone else so that you can help to break the cycle of generational poverty .\" The school was lauded for its academic excellence by <mark>Andrew Mills</mark> from the Ministry of Education, Region Five. He said Bull Savannah Primary is the school of choice in the area and parents, especially single mothers, send their children from as early as age two and a half years old. CHARGE FROM PAST STUDENT Guest speaker, former principal of Hampton School, Heather Murray, and also a past student of Burnt Savannah Primary, delivered a motivational talk to the students, who eagerly absorbed her every word. \"If it's going to be, it is up to me\" was the refrain that Murray used to reinforce to the scholarship winners that Winifred Kagwa has given them a start so it was up to them to make the decision to study hard and make the necessary steps towards achieving their goal. Armed with a litre of the popular drink 7-UP, Murray said, \"I am going to tell you about the seven ups that will take you through your lives. They are get up instead of sitting around waiting for things to happen; dress up by looking the part all the time, shut up because not everything is to be spoken, stand up for your right, look up to God, reach up for what you want, and bless up by practising the attitude of gratitude .\" "}, {"articleID": "2016082418_00943019_W", "names": {"David Law": ["Q39089787", "Q57983265"]}, "date": "2016-08-24", "url": "http://abcnewspapers.com/2016/08/24/minnesota-educators-offer-back-to-school-advice/", "content": "Five major suggestions emerged from 38 Minnesota educators who responded to a request about brief \"back to school\" advice for families. I asked them what they recommend families do to help youngsters get ready for school. These educators offered specific, practical advice. Virtually nothing these educators suggested requires spending money. Joe Nathan The most frequently cited ideas involved: - Moving back into a school year sleep schedule. - Encouraging and helping young people set goals. - Talking positively about the value of learning and schooling. - Developing or reconfirming a positive relationship with educators. - Model the kind of actions, attitudes and behaviors that you want young people to develop. Here's what educators in this area suggested: <mark>David Law</mark>, Anoka-Hennepin superintendent, recommends that families \"Create open lines of communication early and assume positive intentions. Many bumps in the road can be avoided by working with the school and assuming the school is working on your student's behalf .\" Peter Wieczorek, director, Northwest Passage High School wrote: \"For parents of high school students my advice would be talk to your students about the importance of attending school everyday. When students get older it is easier to let then decide if they are going to miss school, but research shows and teachers will tell you that students who miss even a few days a quarter are less likely to graduate .\" Tony Simons, executive director, PACT charter wrote: \"I would tell parents to have the\" Back to School Talk' a couple of weeks before school starts. I have four kids of my own who are now grown and we had this conversation with our kids. \"Simons also recommended the following: 1. Schedules--younger children need to start getting back into their\" school schedule \"a couple of weeks before school starts. This would include bathroom schedules, breakfast options, transportation, and what time school starts. 2. Go over academic and behaviors expectations and the school rules with your children. How you act and talk in the summer sometimes doesn't meet the school standard. If it is a problem get it cleaned up. 3. Challenge your child to make school the most positive experience it can be. A major piece of advice I give is be cooperative with all the adults at school. That means teachers, administration, para-educators, bus drivers, food service workers, supervisors, custodial staff and OTHER STUDENTS. There a lot of kids at school and to get something done academically we all need to cooperate. Brandon Wait, executive director of Paladin Career and Technical High School wrote:\" Routine is key. Sleep is the answer. At school, we see way too many students absent from school or come to school exhausted and lacking sleep. Setting an example or creating a routine of going to sleep at a reasonable time and getting up early will help tremendously with the shock of the early hours the first few weeks of school brings. I think the saying goes, it takes 21 times to form a new habit, so now is the time! Encourage your students to take healthy risks. Try out for a team, audition for a production, run for student government, join a school club or take advantage of school trips. We see so many students come back and say that the enjoyment of high school or best memories come from those formed by the meaningful experiences that happened outside of the classroom. \"Denise Specht, president of Education Minnesota suggests:\" Use the final weeks of summer to ease back into school routines by setting aside a time and place for homework and enforcing a steady schedule of bedtimes and wake-up times. Once school starts, communicate with your child's teachers and learn the best ways to contact them and so you can learn about what is happening in the classroom. Always remember you are your child's learning role model. Show you like to read, write and know how to use technology appropriately. \"Like families, these educators are committed to students' success. It doesn't take a lot of time, and no money is needed to follow these five recommendations. But time, thought and effort are required. However, following these suggestions will have real, positive results.

Focus on the second team. Coach 'em up. Get 'em better. Get 'em ready to go. They're going to be needed. Smart stuff. For this USC team, these coaches and these players, especially these young players. USC will need them, if for no other reason than a 12-game, no-bye-until-the-last-week regular season. But that bye-less schedule is just the first challenge, but maybe not the first reason to do this. It just makes sense. This USC team is actually getting younger, at least in the numbers of guys who will be on the field in the rotation as a percentage of the game participants. When you look at position groups like the O-line, the wide receivers, the linebackers, the D-line even. there was more experience, although maybe fewer players, on the field. The major reason to do this, as we see it, is to get more guys ready to go from the get-go. Right now. Thursday. And Saturday. And the rest of the spring, summer and when fall gets here. \"The best players play,\" Clay said when the talk Tuesday came around to one of those maybe-no-longer-second-team guys--early entry freshman Marlon Tuipulotu who is one of the \"best players\" playing with the first team now after starting out with the twos a couple of weeks ago. That's the kind of second-team focus and \"enhancing\" this team has to be all about. While at least one media person was questioning what kind of message this sends to the upperclassmen when you elevate a freshman, one who should still be thinking about the prom to first team replacing the likes of a married 25-year-old Stevie Tu'ikolovatu, Clay was saying the message was a simple one. Especially when he said it again: \"This is USC...the best players play .\" Not sure there's a better message a coach can deliver--as long as he delivers on it. And not to attempt a return to a decade ago, but it was by far the best thing Pete Carroll communicated in building the nation's best college program when he was here. Because you can't do that unless you coach them up to compete every day. At every position. For the right to be next in line. It's a new way of thinking for this Trojans program coming out of the dark roster days of the NCAA sanctions when just finding enough players who could play at the elite level USC needed them to perform at was all that mattered. Only 12 available defenders to upset a No. 4 Stanford team the first time Clancy Pendergast was here. Well, that would have to be enough. Only the game isn't played that way any more most of the time. Most teams do not slow things down. So the guys USC coaches up on the second team can figure on playing in the rotation when it matters. Which is why Clay's call matters. Why it makes so much sense to come right out and say it. Because as much as Marlon's elevation sends a message, so do Clay's words. And we get the sense they're listening. There are lots of young Trojans who can see themselves making a move--if not onto the first group, into that second group that will play. Because the talent is there. Let's go down the list here position group by position group, starting with defense: *** Outside linebackers: When the two second-teamers you start with are Oluwole Betiku and Connor Murphy, you are not really talking second-teamers. You're talking in-the-rotation guys with Uchenna Nwosu and Porter Gustin. It does not get any better than this. Then there's senior Olajuwon Tucker who can fill in both inside and out. *** Inside linebackers: We've already seen it happen here. With Cam Smith coming down with a stiff neck Tuesday, sophomore Jordan Iosefa stepped in seamlessly from his backup spot. Next to him is early entry freshman Tayler Katoa, whose athleticism will have to make up for his lack of linebacker experience. Which is why he's a target of what Clay is talking about. *** D-Line: With Rasheem Green already in the mix with Marlon, and Kenny Bigelow on the way, the challenge is there for Josh Fatu, who showed some ability to find a spot for himself last fall, along with Malik Dorton and Christian Rector, who did the same, along with two who haven't yet made that move--Jacob Daniel and Liam Jimmons. There's room here for one, two or three of them. It's just for them to make the move. *** Secondary: Here may be the focal point for this whole deal with redshirt freshman star-in-waiting safety/nickel Jamel Cook showing up the way he has going back from second to first team with so much impact. Wherever he spends most of his time, with Ajene Harris battling for that spot, Jamel and his guys will be in a bit of the spotlight. And the numbers are big here for the backup bunch: Ykili Ross, Isiah Langley, Jonathan Lockett, Matt Lopes and C.J. Pollard. The challenge here is not so much the talent or the numbers but getting this group up to speed to communicate and play as fast as the first-teamers. *** Quarterbacks: Perfect timing here for Matt Fink to have his best day as a Trojan in his second spring Tuesday. He threw it, ran it and controlled things in ways we haven't seen. And behind him is a talented early entry freshman Jack Sears who on one play, one adjustment on a throw over two defenders into the deep corner of the end zone, showed he's coming on. USC has to get this right because for all sorts of smart reasons including this one: USC is going to have to protect Sam Darnold--in games and in practices. And someone else is going to have to be out there. *** Running backs: This spring has made it clear how much the next guy in line matters here and with Aca'Cedric Ware and Dominic Davis mostly unavailable, the ball has bounced to redshirt freshman Vavae Malepeai who has stepped up in a big way. The focus is working here. And then Reuben Peters has shown he can do more than block at fullback. And James Toland is back. So get everybody healthy here and find ways to incorporate Ced's toughness and Dom's speed with Vai's knack of making things happen. A lot to work with here for Deland McCullough. *** Tight end: Cary Angeline, we're talking about you here. With some two-tight-end sets for Daniel Imatorbhebhe and Tyler Petite, until the freshman recruits get here, Cary will be it for scholarship tight ends on the second team. Should be able to get plenty of one-on-one coaching from <mark>John Baxter</mark>. *** Wide receivers: This is the position many think Clay is talking about with the number of young talents trying to step up to the place where JuJu Smith-Schuster, Darreus Rogers, De'Quan Hampton and Isaac Whitney, maybe even Adoree' Jackson, vacated. Lots of room here. Deontay Burnett, Jalen Greene, senior <mark>Steven Mitchell</mark> after his rehab and <mark>Michael Pittman</mark> can't take every rep. So there it is for Josh Imatorbhebhe, Tyler Vaughns, the recently switched Pie Young and when he's rehabbed, Trevon Sidney, to make the kind of leap redshirt freshman Velus Jones has made this spring. \"We'll only go as far as they take us,\" Clay said Tuesday. He was talking about the whole group not just the second-team guys. But for this group, it's sometimes hard to tell the difference. But lots of work for Tee Martin here. *** O-Line: The jumble here, with veteran starters Nico Falah and Toa Lobendahn out right now, makes it not so obvious where the line is between the first and second groups. So except for Chuma Edoga and Viane Talamaivao, you could consider all these players in pretty much the same boat from current first-teamers <mark>Chris Brown</mark> and Roy Hemsley, as they switch sides and from guard to tackle, to early entry freshman Andrew Vorhees who has made a big impression, to Cole Smith getting his big chance at center with the ones to <mark>Frank Martin</mark>, also at center, to Clayton Johnston and Jordan Austin, there are a bunch of folks in play here for Neil Callaway to get in line before the rest of the freshmen get here this summer. By our count, that's 36 players who could qualify for the \"second group\" guys Clay is talking about coaching up. And that's not counting the two or three walk-ons every year who matter. That's a number we're not used to seeing, as we've said. And it's why we like the way Clay singled out this group--larger, younger, more talented than we're accustomed to--as an emphasis the rest of the way. Good call.

Updated: September 13, 2019, 1:16 PM IST Akshaye Khanna in a still from Section 375. Loading...Cast: Akshay Khanna, Richa Chadda Director: Ajay Bahl \"We are in the business of law, not justice,\" says Akshay Khanna to Richa Chadda in one of the most poignant moments of Section 375, and nothing could have summed up director Ajay Bahl's film about a rape trial. In fact, this blurred vision of truth and justice is the hallmark of Section 375 that tries to bring out a new side of the argument. There's an alleged rape victim Anjali (Meera Chopra), an alleged rapist Rohan (<mark>Rahul Bhat</mark>), and two warring lawyers Tarun (Akshaye Khanna) and Hiral (Richa Chadda). The director never tells us what exactly happened on the date of the crime, but he reconstructs the events as per the lawyers' versions. It's a ploy to keep us blinkered, and not let us be tilted towards one party. Section 375 focusses on the courtroom drama and the outside factors influencing a judge's decision. In the process, we witness the loopholes of the law and how it could be misused, an accusation faced by laws regarding sexual harassment at many occasions. This also seems to be the film's intention. The accuser and the accused present their sides of the story and then they are reconstructed in front of the judges, who also appear to be facing dilemma regarding the real chain of events. Bahl wins the first battle here as he successfully places a doubt about the accuser's intentions in the viewer's mind. He wants to convey, in no uncertain terms, that even if the decision has been given as per the law, it may still not be right and hence justice might not have been served. Read: Batla House Movie Review Similar to BA Pass, Bahl's impressive directorial debut about the sinister lanes of Delhi's Paharganj, this one also intends to bring out the dark side of the truth. There is no right or wrong, but dubious characters with ambiguous morality. Akshaye Khanna has excelled as the defense solicitor. He hasn't put even one foot wrong, and is clearly within the zone of the intended character. The same can't be said about Richa Chadda though, who couldn't match up to her counterpart in energy and screen presence. For most part if it, Section 375 keeps you confused about the possible outcome of the case, and that's a moral victory Bahl can claim. But then he takes a stand and dilutes the whole idea of being an unbiased presenter of facts of a rape case. Section 375 is engaging and your views towards the film will depend on which side you would like to be.

Slaven Bilic is hoping to build a team that will challenge for promotion next season, after taking charge at the Hawthorns last month and has identified Chalobah as a potential new signing. The 19-year-old spent last season on loan at Ipswich Town in the Championship and scored two goals in 44 appearances for the Tractor Boys, although he was unable to save them from relegation. The teenager, who is capable of playing at centre-back or in defensive midfield, is likely to be sent out on loan again next season to gain more experience. Chalobah is yet to make a senior appearance for Chelsea, but has been a key player for their academy side over the past few seasons and has also represented England at youth level. So, would Chalobah be a good signing for West Brom? We discuss...Toby Wilding \"I could see this being a good signing for West Brom .\" Chalobah has experience at this level from his time at Ipswich last season, and he will be determined to prove his own ability at this level following the dismal campaign endured by the Tractor Boys. \"The 19-year-old clearly has plenty of potential--you don't get taken on by Chelsea for no reason--and West Brom could do to bring in some fresh options in midfield, particularly considering the continued uncertainty around the future of Rekeem Harper at the Hawthorns .\" Having seen the benefits of such a move to both player and club first hand last season, you feel <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> will be happy to let this deal take place, meaning it is one the Baggies should feel confident about completing. \"<mark>George Brooks</mark>\" This could be a good signing for West Brom. \"Chalobah is a talented young football and he wouldn't be at a club like Chelsea unless they thought he had the potential to become a top player .\" The player will know that he probably isn't going to get a chance in the first team at Stamford Bridge next season, so another loan move would make sense for his development. \"He's already got a decent amount of experience in the Championship, having impressed while on loan at Ipswich last season .\" I think he's capable of making an impact for a team like West Brom and he could really benefit from playing for one of the top teams in the league. \"Chalobah can play a centre-back or in defensive midfield, so he would be a very useful option for Bilic to have in his squad .\" West Brom could do with some more depth in midfield, having just released <mark>James Morrison</mark> and seen Stefan Johansen return to Fulham, so Chalobah would be a welcome addition. \"Alfie Burns\" Given the success that the likes of Aston Villa and Derby County had with players like this last season, Chalobah should be a very good addition at the Hawthorns. \"His versatility makes him a useful player, and if he can cover the midfield and defence for Bilic, he will prove to be a good option over the course of a 46-game season .\" Whilst his experience at Ipswich won't have been a pleasant one, it was still something that will have taught him a lot and that kind of character building will be vital for the youngster's career. \"Overall, you'd like to think that this is a sign of what's to come under Bilic, with younger players coming in and replacing some of that\" old guard' that was carried back into the Championship. \"Related Topics: chelsea Trevoh Chalobah West Bromwich Albion Don't Miss 3 players who could stake their first-team claim as Fulham's pre-season kicks-off in coming days <mark>George Brooks</mark>"}]
