(chris riley/times-herald) two years after losing her job as a clerk at travis air force base, <mark>karen taylor</mark> of vallejo is taking her case to the president of the united states. or at least to his front yard. taylor said her health has suffered, and that her retirement, medical benefits and job seniority are at stake. she wants her day in court, and said if that means going to washington next week and standing with protest signs all day for four days in front of the white house then that's what she'll do. \"i'm six feet tall,\" taylor said. \"do you think if i stand out there with these signs held up, i won't be noticed?\" since her story ran in the times-herald in february 2007, taylor, now 45, said she has lost one wrongful termination court case, which is under appeal. there are several other cases related to her racial discrimination and harassment claims pending in federal court, she said. \"i'm going to washington and i'm going to stage a one-woman protest,\" she said. \"i already contacted attorney general <mark>eric holder</mark> to let him know i'm coming .\" no one from the obama administration has responded, she said. \"my job made me happy,\" she said of the employment she began on mare island at 16, before being transferred to travis when the shipyard closed. \"it allowed me to pursue my other interests--feeding the homeless in vallejo on thanksgiving, playing santa for the neighborhood kids at christmas .\" taylor said she has dozens of boxes filled with documentation on her case and wants to present her evidence to a jury. she said she is also fighting for other travis workers of color who may have given up. \"and this is not just for <mark>karen taylor</mark>,\" she said. \"this is for all the african americans on base, so they know they can stand up for what's right .\" no one from travis was immediately available to speak to the issue tuesday afternoon, but in 2007, a spokeswoman said that base officials take complaints of discrimination seriously. \"in 20 years, there have been two (equal employment opportunity) findings against the air force at travis, all revolving around the same case, around 2004,\" capt. vanessa hillman said at the time. \"our commander takes all eeo complaints seriously and, if received, thoroughly investigates .\" no further comment would be forthcoming for privacy reasons, she said. taylor says her problems began when she complained about her new supervisor's employment practices. she went on medical stress leave, and then, despite her doctor's letter assuring her supervisors she'd be well enough to return to work within a month or two, taylor was fired. the stated reason was her \"inability to maintain a regular work schedule,\" according to a termination letter she received. the letter says her firing was \"non-disciplinary in nature\" and that there \"has been no misconduct or delinquency\" on her part. the supervisor has since been promoted and transferred, something hillman said at the time was unrelated to any complaints from minority or female employees. taylor says she won some union grievances and that the previous newspaper article created some noise, but things have stalled. \"my life's on hold, and i don't want to wait until i'm 80 to get recognized,\" she said. \"i don't want them to wait until i'm dead to say,\" yes, we did miss taylor wrong .' \"taylor's former union vice president joel perry said that while it's been a long time, he recalls that she had suffered reprisals and that a settlement was reached for some back pay. he attributed her problems to a\" personality conflict \"and not race or gender, however, and his opinion hasn't changed. the union no longer represents taylor, he said .\" we haven't represented her in years, \"perry said .\" she left her employment and she didn't think we were doing enough for her, so she left us. \"vallejo trustees to get panel's list of schools suggested for ...",

his corporate credit card. the senior officer said an inquiry by dorset chief constable <mark>martin baker</mark> found a series of allegations against him were unfounded and baseless. mr dizaei, 47, was accused of failing to repay money he spent on a police american express card and no advertisement t keeping receipts. it was alleged he spent more than \u00a3 5,000 on clothes and perfume while on a trip to the united states. a file was passed back to the independent police complaints commission (ipcc) earlier this week. but it is now for members of the metropolitan police authority (mpa) to examine it and decide whether mr dizaei should face any further action. alfred john, of the metropolitan black police association, which supports mr dizaei, said the officer always maintained the claims were without foundation. he said: \"following a 14-month criminal investigation, where commander dizaei's expenses going back several years have been scrutinised, dorset police concluded that there was no case to answer and the allegations have been withdrawn .\" we are pleased that our member has been fully vindicated of this grave allegation and we thank the chief constable of dorset

has had the wonderful fortune to have former canadian olympic team gymnast heather purnell helping coach the club's young athletes for the past several months. the 22-year-old purnell, who will celebrate her 23rd birthday in the middle of next week, has been working with the club's pre-competitive gymnasts, preparing them for their provincial qualifiers that begin in december. \"i think it's been great to have someone with that resum\u00e9. she's brought a lot of experience and a lot of ideas to us,\" said brockville head coach kim charbonneau - speck. \"that's been good for our competitive kids .\" purnell was the captain of the canadian team when she was the 17-year-old member of the olympic team in 2004 in athens, greece. she competed at the pan - am games, finished in second place at the all-around category in the 2002 and 2003 canadian championships and was a former canadian junior all-around champion. the three-year member of the stanford university gymnastics team was looking for somewhere to help coach. with her parents now living in merrickville, it was closer to come to brockville than her native ottawa. plus, she knew charbonneau-speck previously. \"i feel it's good for the kids to see someone like heather, who competed in the 2004 olympics, who went on to stanford and then to cirque de soleil,\" said charbonneau - speck. \"that shows them the sport doesn't have to end at an early age. there are other opportunities to move forward .\" she contacted charbonneau - speck about a possible coaching opening and she who was only too happy to welcome purnell's expertise. \"it's really nice coming in, coaching in a good club like this,\" said purnell during a break in a four-hour practice session on sunday morning. \"it's really good to come in and have them soak up everything i can give them .\" with the young group, purnell has been concentrating on coaching the basics and fundamentals of the sport, working with conditioning. \"right now, we're working on a lot of basics and strengthening. you can't do the moves if you're not strong enough to do it,\" said purnell. \"if you're trying to do skills that are too much and you don't have the basics, it's too dangerous .\" she's enjoying the new coaching aspect of her life, even though she might have to leave in the next few weeks. \"the most important thing for them (the athletes) is to have fun at this age,\" said purnell. \"that's important. it's not doing all the tricks you see on television. it's training and working and you have to make sure they have fun at it .\" purnell was impressed with the quality of the coaching at the brockville club for the young gymnasts. \"it's nice to be here. it's important they (young kids) have something to keep them busy,\" said purnell. \"so often now, kids are watching tv. to be active and have a solid network with other young kids is really important .\" purnell is in limbo right now with her future up in the air. she's thinking about returning to school to do graduate work in clinical psychology along with waiting to hear from an audition for cirque de soleil. st. lawrence shakespeare festival - 2010 daily
