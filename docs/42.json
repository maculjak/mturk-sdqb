By Brandon Stahl Star Tribune December 1, 2015--5:11 pm Jerry Holt, Star TribunePolice are searching a horse farm near Herman in the continuing efforts to find Gianna and Samantha Rucki, who went missing in April 2013. Wednesday November 18, 2015 in Herman, MN. Purchase: Order Reprint The runaway Lakeville sisters who had been missing for two and a half years will be sent to an intensive out-of-state reunification program after a Dakota County judge pulled them out of foster care Monday. The program aims to overcome the resistance of Gianna and Samantha Rucki to moving back in with their father, whom they still refuse to live with, less than two weeks after they were discovered on a western Minnesota horse farm. Saying the girls' \"life has become a circus,\" Judge <mark>Michael Mayer</mark> had to choose among three competing arguments of where Gianna, 16, and Samantha, 17, should go. Dakota County child protection thought they should stay in foster care. The couple who kept the runaway teens at the White Horse Ranch filed a petition on Monday saying the girls were best off with them. \"We love the children and believe we can provide them the best environment under these current circumstances,\" Doug and Gina Dahlen wrote in their motion. Before the girls ran away in April 2013, the teens repeatedly accused their father of abuse, but a court-appointed psychologist concluded that their mother, Sandra Grazzini-Rucki, had brainwashed them. Their father, David Rucki, was granted full custody of the children in November 2013 after a judge ruled that there was no credible evidence that the girls were abused. Case gone \"massively awry' Dakota County child protection placed the girls in a foster care home a few days after they were found and on Monday asked a judge to keep them there. The county argued that the girls were likely to flee again and needed to be in a safe and stable environment after refusing to live with their father. An attorney for the girls said they promised not to run away if they were allowed to remain in foster care. David Rucki objected, saying he is willing and able to care for the girls. The judge agreed, saying he had no jurisdiction to keep them under the county's supervision .\" I think I have a family law case that has gone massively awry, \"he said. <mark>Mayer</mark>'s decision gave full parental rights back to Rucki, who said he will put them in a reunification program. At the hearing, <mark>Mayer</mark> said he agreed with sending them to the program, which he described as lasting six to eight hours a day for about six to 10 weeks .\" The girls have indicated to me that they would run, \"<mark>Mayer</mark> said .\" I can't make them like their parents again. I can't make them love their parents again. But...I can give them the tools to make that happen. \"Rucki said after the hearing that he was\" elated \"by <mark>Mayer</mark>'s decision .\" I'm going to try to move forward now and get the girls the help they need, \"he said. Rucki said he was working on a plan to ensure the girls would not run away while being transported to the reunification program. Mom faces felony counts The girls' mother, Sandra Grazzini-Rucki, faces six felony counts of deprivation of parental rights, after Dakota County prosecutors alleged that she and another woman left the girls at the White Horse Ranch four days after they ran away. In a child protection petition filed last week, a Dakota County social worker said the girls told them that they were home-schooled and assisted with chores on the farm the last two years. One of the girls\" reported not having any contact with their mother \"in years' and assumed she was incarcerated .\" In their petition asking to intervene in that case, the Dahlens wrote that when the girls arrived, they had \"extreme personal fear, there was reasonable belief that they had been emotionally threatened with their life and physically abused .\" Over the next two and a half years, the Dahlens wrote, they helped the girls overcome some of their fears and grew to love the girls. \"We have provided the children with a home and shelter and all the necessities of life including food, clothing, health care, education, religious upbringing, love, support and companionship,\" the Dahlens wrote. \"The children developed friendships here and were a part of this community. The children have their ranch pets they have connected with and it has been therapeutic for them. The children indicated they wanted to stay at the ranch home .\" The judge's ruling effectively shut down that effort. <mark>Mayer</mark> noted that there were \"ongoing criminal investigations\" against the Dahlens. Outside the courtroom, the Dahlens declined to comment."}, {"articleID": "2017081420_00374373_W", "names": {"Matt Wilkinson": ["Q21091668", "Q6789524"], "Owen Wright": ["Q3359004", "Q7114703", "Q7114704"], "Julian Wilson": ["Q27068761", "Q6307688", "Q6307689"], "Gabriel Medina": ["Q3093867", "Q42394048", "Q5873447"]}, "date": "2017-08-14", "url": "https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/wilko-slips-in-world-title-race/3212323/", "content": "TIGHT FINISH: Byron Bay surfer <mark>Matt Wilkinson</mark> has dropped to third on the World Championship Tour rankings.

According to sources familiar with the situation, a school-wide meeting has been scheduled for 1:00 p.m. EDT to address reports of administrative upheaval at the government-funded institution. What exactly is going on? It is not immediately clear, however our news outlet has confirmed that the school's vice president of finance and administration--<mark>John Warner</mark>--is no longer employed by SCGSAH. In fact, <mark>Warner</mark>'s biographical page on the school website is currently displaying a 404 error. This news outlet has been told that \"multiple administrative positions at the school have been terminated,\" but as of this writing we cannot confirm any additional names. <mark>Warner</mark> (below), an ex-entrepreneur, was an integral part of the school's latest expansion project--a $4.3 million rehearsal center funded by South Carolina taxpayers.

A roaring wildfire was racing down the mountain and the flames would be there soon. It was time to get out. But John Wullbrandt, a prolific artist who'd been painting the landscape around La Granada Mountain since he was a teenager, refused to leave. He'd been preparing for this moment for the last 15 years. The 100-acre former cattle ranch just above Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County has been in Wullbrandt's family for four generations. Fire was always a threat. He and his partner, Jean-Claude Rivalland, had encased the house in corrugated steel, installed three 5,000-gallon water tanks and laid 300 feet of fire hose. Each year, they cleared vegetation around the house and had circled the structure with fire-resistant succulents. Decades of his paintings, including the works he cherished most, were tucked away in two steel shipping containers he believed could withstand a wildfire. They were going to stay, and fight. Shortly after midnight on Dec. 10, as the Thomas fire raced toward them, Wullbrandt took the northeast corner of the house, Rivalland the southwest. They tied their animals--two donkeys, two cows, a mule and a horse--to the side of the house and hosed them down with water. They figured their four dogs and two cats would be safe inside the house, and the tortoise could ride out the fire in the bathtub. Finally, the towering wall of flames reached them. They affixed their mask respirators and battled the onslaught with fire hoses, buckets of water and the animals' drinking troughs. The fire's deafening moan was so loud it sounded like a freight train, and the smoke so thick, they couldn't communicate or see one another. So they fought solo, each feeling he was the last man on Earth, ensconced in scalding heat, flying embers and whirling ash. Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times The 2017 Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties leaves behind vast swaths of charred landscape like this area in Upper Rincon Canyon. The 2017 Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties leaves behind vast swaths of charred landscape like this area in Upper Rincon Canyon. (Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times) When it was over, Wullbrandt had learned what near-death looks like: it is crimson and deep orange, as if rendered in the \"Naphthol Red\" and \"Cadmium Orange\" tubes of paint that he often works with. It is brilliant and murky at once, with flickers of gold, deep-green and blue, like the rolling hills, ripe fruit and sun-dappled beach in Wullbrandt's downtown Carpinteria murals. In the eye of the fire, not unlike when he's painting sometimes, Wullbrandt says he felt an otherworldly calm. \"It was like being in the epicenter of a blowtorch,\" Wullbrandt says. \"It took all of our might. But we were well prepared, we were confident, like when I paint--I had peace of mind. It was actually quite beautiful, haunting .\" An artist comes home With his tanned face, bushy, Santa Claus-like beard and soft, hazel eyes, 66-year-old Wullbrandt looks like a modern-day cowboy, rugged and sensitive. He grew up in Carpinteria, where his late father, Ernest C. Wullbrandt, served multiple terms as mayor. The sleepy beach town was spared from the fire, the largest in California history, but is still dangerously smoky more than a week after the first flames. As Wullbrandt strolls down the ash-speckled sidewalks of Wullbrandt Way--named after his father--he stirs a \"big man on campus\" reaction. Neighbors, friends, local business owners--some wearing dust masks as they run errands--nod as they pass by, often slapping him on the shoulder or stopping for hugs. Driving up the mountain to Wullbrandt's ranch in his old Mitsubishi SUV, the scene along the rocky, dirt road looks like a steam punk moonscape of blackened tree skeletons coated in gray ash. Crisped shipping containers and lone propane tanks litter empty lots where houses once stood, their barbed wire fences now bent and charred. Spindly curls of smoke swirl up from the canyon below, where tree trunk stumps still smolder, their roots still sparking with fire. The air is so thick with smoke, it leaves a bitter, burnt taste with every breath. When the wind picks up, it sends enormous, billowy clouds of gray ash into the car's path, obscuring the bumpy road ahead. Wullbrandt left the area in 1978 for San Francisco, he explains in the car, to forge a career as an artist. He was rejected by the commercial gallery establishment there--\"devastating\" at the time, he says--but he made a living over more than three decades through private commissions and selling artwork to luxury hotels and resorts around the U.S. mainland and Hawaii. His pastoral scenes of local flora and fauna and illustrated cultural histories have adorned hotel suites, lobbies and golf clubhouses. With San Francisco as his home base, Wullbrandt traveled the world for weeks at a time looking for inspiration--India, Nepal, Japan, South Africa--and making paintings. He spent time in 1994 as artist-in-residence for King George of Tonga, he says, creating interior murals for a new villa. Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times Once the Thomas fire had scorched off the needles on the ranch's cactus plants, the cows could enjoy the tasty succulents without pain. Planting cactus, aloe and agave proved fortuitous. Once the Thomas fire had scorched off the needles on the ranch's cactus plants, the cows could enjoy the tasty succulents without pain. Planting cactus, aloe and agave proved fortuitous. (Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times) His many public artworks have included a site-specific mural about the history of the Van Nuys Airport, a city-commissioned architectural trompe l'oeil on a building in San Francisco's Tenderloin district and multiple murals inside the Dole Food Co.'s corporate headquarters in Westlake Village. When San Francisco became too expensive for the artist and his longtime partner, they returned to Carpinteria and in 2002 bought \"El Rancho Botello,\" which his great-great uncle homesteaded in 1913. It was a working cattle ranch until last year. Wullbrandt, a longtime vegetarian, suddenly had to learn how to brand and castrate cows, buck hay and herd cattle. All the while, Wullbrandt painted, working intensely for weeks at a time either in his studio, a stand-alone cabin encased in metal, or outside two adjacent shipping containers situated about 600 feet from the house. Capturing the local landscape and its history is his passion. Nearly all of his neighbors own pieces of his art, he says. In 2013, the late \"Fast & Furious\" actor <mark>Paul Walker</mark> commissioned two pieces. One of his works is in the collection of the Carpinteria Valley Museum of History; others are on loan to local businesses. His most recent mural, chronicling agricultural development in Carpinteria, was unveiled in the town's center earlier this year. Knowing that his personal collection of paintings was safe in his studio--decades of carefully rendered observations--brought him a deep sense of purpose and accomplishment. \"So many of my murals have been destroyed over the years,\" he says, \"I felt it was responsible to hold onto some [art]--that I was in charge of holding onto my own history .\" A flaw in the plan The inferno, which cut through Wullbrandt's property like \"fast-flowing lava,\" torched 100-year-old oaks, ceanothus trees and swaths of coyote bush. It left the outer regions of the ranch burned to a crisp, the now-ashy landscape dotted with sizzled trees, charred antique farm equipment, shattered glass and fried rat and rabbit carcasses. Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times Painter John Wullbrandt and partner Jean-Claude Rivalland's ranch house just above Carpinteria was spared from the flames of the Thomas fire. Painter John Wullbrandt and partner Jean-Claude Rivalland's ranch house just above Carpinteria was spared from the flames of the Thomas fire. (Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times) Wullbrandt admits that some might consider it irresponsible to stay at the ranch and fight the fire, especially considering the sheriff's call, two days earlier, urging them to evacuate. \"But I'm passionate about where I live and I have the freedom to make that choice,\" he says. \"The ranch hadn't burned in over 100 years, so we knew it was coming, it was inevitable. We prepared. We spend 15 years being responsible .\" And the plan worked, at least in part. The house and its immediate surroundings were untouched, save for a 1-inch burn spot on the front porch step and tiny fire lashings on the porch posts. But all his preparations for protecting the art studio were for naught. It was burned into oblivion. Wullbrandt knew the studio and shipping containers had wood floors, but he was certain there was metal beneath them. That was not the case. The fire blew underneath and ignited everything inside, turning decades worth of paintings into ash. The oldest work that Wullbrandt lost was a series of charcoal figurative drawings from when he was in junior high school; his most treasured work lost was a still life painting of an Art Deco vase in which he felt he'd successfully experimented with the rules of composition. Most devastating, Wullbrandt says, is his ravaged archives: 50 years worth of letters, personal photographs and slides, portfolios of drawings and sketches, treasured books, maquettes for murals, pre-internet newspaper and magazine articles about him, along with TV and radio interviews on VHS and cassette tapes and documentation from early public art projects--all turned to dust.

Rivalland hosed down the donkeys with water as flames approached. (Hal Wells / Los Angeles Times) The corrugated steel barn, too, was destroyed; it also didn't have a metal floor, as Wullbrandt had thought. He lost three significant large-scale paintings that were housed there, along with family heirloom furniture, century-old tools his family used to build the ranch and his sister's collection of antique saddles. \"It was terrible,\" he says of watching his art studio burn during the fire. \"But I thought:\" We're alive. \"' Sorrow and liberation This is what rejuvenation looks like: It is\" Chromium Oxide Green \"and\" Light Blue Violet, \"like the tubes of paint Wullbrandt will use in the landscape paintings he's planning for an upcoming show. Just a week before the fire, he was voted into the Oak Group, an artists organization that raises money for environmental preservation causes. They'll exhibit his work at the Santa Barbara Public Library's Faulkner Gallery, as part of a group show, in the fall. He'll also have a solo show in 2018 at Carpinteria's Palm Loft Gallery, he says .\" The fire has given me an opportunity to show my work, it's given me something to head towards, \"Wullbrandt says. Losing so much in the fire, he says, has been oddly liberating. For years, Wullbrandt meant to organize his archives. But that would have required classifying his history, and he isn't one who likes to be pigeonholed, he says. He never clung to an artistic identity as a\" muralist \"or\" landscape painter, \"for example; instead, he's toggled between genres, experimenting with figure drawing, magical realism, abstraction, landscapes and set design, among other styles. Losing everything frees him from the daunting task of sorting his sprawling life's work and, for better or worse, from his personal narrative. It presented an opportunity to start anew .\" There's not being burdened with all the trappings of my life, \"he says .\" I thought that one day I would take all of this archival stuff and turn it over to someone; and somehow that would validate my career. But I don't have to do that now. I'm free to paint. \"Wullbrandt may be eerily at peace about the Thomas fire, but standing by the remains of his destroyed barn--now just layers of charred steel--he chokes up thinking about his ancestors .\" The fact that my family's ranch burned on my watch, \"he says, tears pooling in his now bloodshot eyes .\" It's been tough. But I know I did everything I could. My ancestors would be darn proud. \"The sorrow is compounded at the mention of his neighbors .\" My heart goes out to those who have lost far more than I have, \"he says. Still, Wullbrandt remains optimistic. In town, Wullbrandt stops at a small garage that was once his grandfather's plumbing shop and which he now uses for storage. He lifts the metal grate and there, piled up with the cardboard boxes, bikes and old furniture, was a glossy, 10-foot-wide painting of his ranch in better times, vibrant and alive. It depicts cowboys roping and herding cattle across dark green hills, the Carpinteria Valley and city of Santa Barbara stretching out to the sea in the background .\" Gone, all of this gone, \"he says, sweeping his hand across the landscape depicted in the painting. But with loss comes new life .\" It really will be like the Phoenix rising out of the ashes, the rebirth, \"he says .\" It will be so much more beautiful once it starts to rejuvenate. We're gonna see wildflowers we haven't seen in 100 years. \"Then Wullbrandt gazes up at a mountain ridge in the distance, now a thin, ash-gray paint stroke on the horizon .\" The spring--just wait. As an artist, I can't wait to paint it. \"CAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including\" Call Me by Your Name \"and\" The Florida Project. \"Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including\" Call Me by Your Name \"and\" The Florida Project. \"CAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including\" Call Me by Your Name \"and\" The Florida Project. \"Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including\" Call Me by Your Name \"and\" The Florida Project. \"CAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp on what critics awards mean for the Oscars, factoring in the academy's expanding membership.

David Birnbaum, Special to Montreal Gazette Published on: February 28, 2018 | Last Updated: February 28, 2018 2:50 PM EST The next Quebec election is expected Oct. 1. \"I join the premier, Minister Kathleen Weil and all of my caucus colleagues in hoping that English-speaking Quebecers will engage fully in the upcoming campaign, with questions, suggestions and criticism of all of the parties that wish to form the next government,\" Liberal MNA David Birnbaum writes. <mark>Graham Hughes</mark> / THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print Chess anyone? Robert Libman (\"Anglos should seize opportunity to be heard,\" Opinion, Feb. 27) suggests that English-speaking Quebecers \"play the strategic chess game and be a factor in the run-up to the election .\" I could not agree more. I have spent most of my professional life advocating on behalf of those one million Quebecers who are English-speaking, and I continue to do so in my current roles. I've known and worked with Robert Libman over the years, and absolutely subscribe to the importance he places on community mobilization. However, I do not share his often-expressed view that English-speaking Quebecers have been too apathetic and passive. Nor do I buy into his description of us as \"anglophones,\" a somewhat pejorative term that leaves out thousands of English-speaking Quebecers from cultural communities who view that tired term as exclusive of them. As Premier Philippe Couillard has insisted and demonstrated, we are all Quebecers, point final. That said, I join the premier, Minister Kathleen Weil and all of my caucus colleagues in hoping that English-speaking Quebecers will engage fully in the upcoming campaign, with questions, suggestions and criticism of all of the parties that wish to form the next government. They should properly call for results from our ground-breaking creation of a designated bureaucracy and cabinet post for relations with the English-speaking community across Quebec. They should be expecting renewed access plans for the delivery of health and social services in English, progress on French second-language instruction, job support for young English-speaking entrepreneurs and better access to the civil service and government appointments. On those questions and others, they will want to shine a light not only on us, but on all of our opponents as well. Are they comfortable with Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec Leader Fran\u00e7ois Legault's summary dismissal of our new Secretariat responsible to the English-speaking community? His plan to limit immigration and to institute obligatory language tests for newcomers? His plan to scrap linguistic and universally elected school boards? His vague and fuzzy conversion to the Canadian federation? His distaste, expressed and on the record in the National Assembly, at the thought of a judge wearing a kippa? Are English-speaking Quebecers actually ready to consider the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, whose short stint as a minister included nominal responsibility for us \"anglophones\" ? His single evident accomplishment in that role was to free up 20 grand for a song called Our Home. Are they prepared to support a party that promises to talk separation only on every second Tuesday? Qu\u00e9bec solidaire unabashedly promotes separation. Has anybody ever seen the slightest credible budget plan to support their utopian list of promises? Or, will English-speaking Quebecers carefully examine our government's record and its vision for a modern, prosperous Quebec? Will they look at a recent Liberal Party resolution to offer free French second-language instruction to the English-speaking adult population? Action plans on seniors, culture and infrastructure that will include specific measures aimed at our community? An approach on immigration, diversity and French-language promotion that is inclusive and forward-looking? A long-standing conviction and record predicated on English-speaking Quebecers as allies rather than adversaries? And, are an impending fifth balanced budget, 250,000 new jobs, a level of economic growth that is the envy of the rest of Canada not English-speaking issues as well? Yes, we can do better, and we count on the English-speaking community to call us out when we don't. We invite the community to exercise that same vigilance in evaluating our opponents. That should make for a fair game of chess, and may our community come out the winner.

That's shown in both the play of the current group of players in the secondary. Along with the commits, he's garnered in that period, making him the No. 4 recruiter in the country according to 247Sports. His first achievement as the Buckeyes' co-defensive coordinator was getting a recommitment from Lejond Cavazos of IMG Academy (Fla.). That process started the moment he got settled into Columbus, and Cavazos was the first recruit Hafley reached out to. That decision paid off, and four months later, Cavazos was back in Ohio State's 2020 class and has been one of the program's most prominent advocates ever since. Hafley made Cavazos feel comfortable with him. He gave him other reasons to fall in love with Ohio State that didn't require Urban Meyer to be a part of it. Now, as a commit, he's seen the strides Ohio State has taken in the secondary. The relationship he's built with the current players has given him confidence in the future of the defensive backs at Ohio State. Everyone he's talked to has had nothing but positive things to say about their new position coach. \"All of them have changed,\" Cavazos told cleveland.com. \"They say that it's a totally different atmosphere. It's a better technique that they've learned. He's letting them be them and get loose. Hearing that from the players was a big set off for me. I know if he's helping them get to where they want to get to, he can for sure help me .\" While making headway on the recruiting trails, which eventually led to 13 commitments between June and July--four of which he had a hand in--he was also spending time revamping a secondary that had a less than stellar 2018. His first step was sitting down with Okudah and watching every single target the junior cornerback had last season. \"He gave feedback after every single rep,\" Okudah said. \"After listening to him in that one-hour session, I was like\" Ok, he knows what he's talking about .' I listened to his plans for making me better and after that, I just bought in. \"Okudah and the rest of the secondary buying into Hafley's words have resulted in 10 interceptions this season, which sits at No. 2 in the Big Ten. The Buckeyes have also allowed a nation's best 1,062 passing yards per game this season. Jordan Fuller has experienced the Jeff Hafley effect as both from both Cavazos' and Okudah's perspectives. During his time at Rutgers, Halfeyr recruited Fuller's brother, Devin, who eventually chose UCLA. He got a chance to see how Hafley made recruits and their families feel comfortable .\" He was probably my brother's favor coach/recruiter, \"Fuller said .\" I definitely thought he was a great guy. Me and my brother think the same, so whoever he likes, I like. It's just grown from there since he's been here. \"Now he's experiencing it as one of his players, and the feedback has been just as positive. But there's a chance that the entire starting secondary will only get one year of Hafley. Fuller and Damon Arnette are fifth-year seniors, while Okudah and Shaun Wade could both head for the NFL after three seasons. That's played a role in Hafley's success as a recruiter. It'll be open season for every spot in the secondary, and many of the guys in Ohio State's 2020 recruiting class are talented enough to get on the field right away. They've watched how Ohio State has played this season and are ready to continue that tradition of elite-level defensive backs in the upcoming seasons .\" That's the plan, \"Cavazos said .\" It's up for grabs, and it's pretty much whoever wants it at that point. \"More Ohio State coverage Why the CFP committee loves Ohio State, and the results of the pizza challenge: Buckeye Talk Podcast What No. 1 in the first College Football Playoff ranking means for Ohio State football Why Penn State emerged as the biggest threat to Ohio State's Big Ten championship aspirations Ohio State vs. Penn State football will be a noon kickoff on Nov. 23 Ohio State basketball overcomes rough first half to knock off Cincinnati 64-56 in season opener LSU vs. Alabama matchup has implications for the Heisman, playoff: Heisman Watch How can Ohio State football's offense get better?
