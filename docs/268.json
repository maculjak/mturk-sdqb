In Fort Wayne, the effort to support the Ebola crisis is strong. Various localized efforts, like the church-based campaign by Mike and Kathy Doscek reported in The News-Sentinel today, have connected small local organizations with international relief organizations to help raise money and make an impact. The Doscek's and their church, St. John's Lutheran Church in Lake Township, are partnering with Direct Relief International, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that provides medical assistance to people around the world who have been affected by crisis. Tony Morain, vice president of marketing and development of Direct Relief International, said the organization has been working in West Africa for many years addressing the failing healthcare system, and as soon as the first cases of Ebola was reported, they ushered in their local, trained emergency responders and began sending tons of medical supplies. \"Our model is one where we work with locals within the community. There are real people that are responding to the needs in their communities. Then when an emergency happens, they become the immediate emergency responder. We built relationships with these people and then we are able to respond quickly when things are difficult,\" he said. He also said the timeliness is highly consequential when it comes to halting the spread of the virus. \"If collectively we could have gathered enough support and donations two months ago we would not be faced with this challenge. In terms of the problem of this scope, we do not have just one organization that can do it alone. People need to work together. We have been sending ongoing shipments every two weeks, and that includes the largest airlift of supplies to the region to date. As the crisis continues, it becomes more and more difficult to get supplies there. We need to maintain our support but as each day passes, it's more critical,\" he said. Depending on the fundraising organization, money raised will go toward transportation, medical supplies, waste disposal, training and sending emergency response workers. Locally, in addition Doscek campaign, the Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend is encouraging people to donate to the Catholic Relief Services, the U.S. bishops' overseas relief and development agency. Recently, the group has increased its support in affected countries and spent $376,000 toward training volunteers and religious leaders, providing hygiene kits and making household visits in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana. For those interested, the US Agency for International Development has put together a list of 37 non-governmental organizations that are working on the Ebola crisis, with direct links for how to donate to them online. Check out the list by visiting: http: //www.cidi.org/ebola-ngos/ #.VBBv7S5dXIV. While local efforts are relatively strong, the worldwide fundraising efforts are lackadaisical. <mark>Patrick Rooney</mark>, associate dean for academic affairs and research at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in Indianapolis, said, in terms of the fundraising efforts, results have been shockingly small compared to larger scale disasters such as natural disasters. \"For whatever reason, this topic has not captured the same attention. My theory is because very few Americans have contracted the disease and it's mostly centered in West Africa. The mainstream media has been more focused on the American angle and not the total calamity in West Africa,\" he said. And the numbers of the total calamity are staggering. Wednesday, the World Health Organization reported there have been 8,914 cases overall, including the fatal cases. The WHO said it expects this number to top 9,000 by the end of the week. The organization also warned that West Africa could face up to 10,000 new Ebola cases a week within two months, adding that the death rate in the current outbreak has risen to 70 percent. In the U.S., a Dallas nurse who caught Ebola while treating a Liberian patient received a plasma transfusion donated by a doctor who beat the virus. Nina Pham, a 26-year-old nurse, was among 70 staff members at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who cared for Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, according to medical records. And health workers have been hit the hardest by the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids like blood, vomit and diarrhea. Doctors Without Borders said 16 of its employees had been infected with Ebola and nine of them have died. Experts note that there's an immediate demand for medical care and education, as well as long-term help dealing with the ripple effects such as orphans and stabilizing an already troubled economy. <mark>Rooney</mark> reiterates that for those wanting to donate, monetary donations to well-known and legitimate organizations and charities are the best option. \"If people want to donate, there are organizations locally, nationally as well as internationally that would be happy to accept donations. This is an opportunity to help something or someone,\" <mark>Rooney</mark> said.", "articleID": "2014101511_00087983_W", "names": {"Patrick Rooney": ["Q26261010", "Q33522416", "Q50326815"]}}, {"date": "2014-10-15", "url": "http://upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/10/14/Oklahoma-newspaper-publisher-wife-daughter-slain-in-home/1001413313626/?spt=hts&or=3", "content": "Oklahoma newspaper publisher, wife, daughter slain in home The publisher of two weekly newspapers in Oklahoma, his wife and daughter were found slain in their home in Duncan, police said.

The account of threatening behavior, not only toward Peterson Middle School Principal Susan Harris but also toward Superintendent <mark>Stan Rose</mark> and others, emerged in a hearing in Santa Clara County Superior Court. Harris is seeking to make permanent a temporary restraining order granted Sept. 24 against Stampolis, 48. \"He was angry and he was yelling and he was really pissed off,\" Harris said. As Stampolis moved closer, she said, \"I could feel his breath on my face ....I put my hands up .\" Santa Clara Unified School District's Board of Education board member Christopher Stampolis during a board meeting in the district board room in Santa Clara, Calif. on Thursday, May 30, 2013. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) (Nhat V. Meyer) She said she was afraid the visibly enraged Stampolis was going to hit or push her. Stampolis' gestures were caught by a campus security camera. Harris' attorney, Eugene Whitlock, introduced still photos from that recording. But Stampolis' attorney, Tomas Margain, suggested instead that his client had been signaling Harris to \"put it in writing\" by simulating a paper and pencil with his hands. \"People do it in restaurants,\" he said. More than 40 people, including former superintendents, principals, teachers and parents attended the hearing to support Harris, who said the interactions and lack of immediate direction from the Santa Clara Unified School District sent her to the emergency room in September with anxiety. Sunnyvale police Officer Todd Fekete and <mark>Brian Allen</mark>, a security guard hired by the school district, also talked with Stampolis, Harris testified. On Sept. 23, when Stampolis arrived on campus 40 minutes after school let out, the guard handed him a 14-day stay-away order from Peterson. During their conversation in the school office, Stampolis' son sat nearby, apparently doing his homework. Immediately afterward, Stampolis, an attorney, drove to the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety to try to have his son file a complaint against Harris, alleging false imprisonment. \"I felt this was another example of being harassed,\" Harris told the court. \"I felt like my job safety was at risk .\" Fekete testified that he told Stampolis that there was no merit to the false-imprisonment charge and would not take a report. Stampolis also filed a harassment claim against Harris. The school district hired an independent investigator, Thomas Newcomb, who cleared her of the accusation, she testified. Stampolis was elected to the Santa Clara Unified school board two years ago. To support Harris' request, Whitlock introduced documents indicating that Stampolis: Last month threatened <mark>Rose</mark>, telling him, \"I'm going to inflict as much pain as I can on you and your wife,\" Whitlock said. Threatened a parent who criticized his behavior at meetings of a school-site council. \"Stampolis got in her face and threatened to sue her,\" Whitlock said. Was the subject of a Peterson staff petition presented last month to the board to protest unsafe working conditions because of fear of Stampolis. Publicly accused another middle school principal of keeping a hidden bank account. A school district investigation cleared the principal and also showed a letter detailing the allegation was written by Stampolis but was signed by someone else. Followed home in his car a Santa Clara High junior who last year criticized Stampolis and other board members at a meeting. Whitlock also mentioned a 2006 case in Los Angeles. A clerk at a storage facility won a $35,000 settlement with Stampolis for aggressive, intimidating behavior. Judge Thomas E. Kuhnle refused to permit the playing of the 911 tape in that incident. Controversy has followed the public life of Stampolis, who previously served on the West Valley-Mission Community College District board. Last year, Santa Clara teachers angry at him staged a work slowdown. In 2012 former Santa Clara administrators and trustees who served with him took out ads opposing his candidacy. After his election, administrators who felt targeted by him left the district. In a telephone interview last month, Stampolis acknowledged that he may have been late a couple of times picking up his son since school started in August. Peterson requires that students leave campus or be picked up within 20 minutes of the end of the school day. But Stampolis also said that Newcomb's report will contradict the charges. \"All the staff concluded that I was cordial and pleasant to all staff,\" Stampolis said. The case was continued to Thursday afternoon with testimony from witnesses and with cross-examination.", "articleID": "2014101516_00000771_W", "names": {"Brian Allen": ["Q25190022", "Q27983414", "Q30122545", "Q4962957", "Q4962958", "Q55605910"], "Stan Rose": ["Q19517739", "Q7597862"]}}, {"date": "2014-10-15", "url": "http://scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/world-s-end-trial-friend-saw-accused-with-teens-1-3574140", "content": "click here If you have not signed up previously It's free and only takes a minute!

Keep up to date with all aspects of Scottish life with The Scotsman iPhone app, completely free to download and use. Sinclair, 69, has pleaded not guilty to assaulting, raping and murdering the 17-year-olds between October 15 and 16 1977 between the pub and locations in East Lothian. Ms Thomson, who was with the girls on the night they went missing and were killed, was giving evidence on the third day of Sinclair's trial at the High Court in Livingston. She told the court that she and another friend, Tony, had left Christine and <mark>Helen</mark> in the World's End in the company of two men at around 10.45 pm on Saturday October 15, 37 years ago. Prosecuting, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland said Ms Thomson had been shown a series of 12 photographs of men by the police in 2004. Mr Mulholland said she was shown the images to see if she could identify anyone who was one of the males she saw with the girls in the pub in 1977. Pointing to Sinclair, he told the court Ms Thomson had identified the accused. He asked: \"How sure were you that this person on photo K, Angus Sinclair, was one of the two male persons?\" Ms Thomson replied: \"In 1977 he looked quite a lot different - younger than that. It is hard to say because I had seen photos in the newspapers .\" Mr Mulholland asked her to answer the question directly, stating: \"How sure were you?\" * Please type the postcode as the example above Try The Scotsman app for 30 days free!

The Precidian proposal falls \"far short of providing a suitable alternative to the arbitrage activity in ETF shares that is crucial to helping keep the market price of current ETF shares at or close\" to its net asset value, <mark>Kevin O'Neill</mark>, a deputy secretary at the The ruling hinders plans by asset managers to sell funds run by traditional stock-picking managers in an ETF package. Firms including Capital Group Cos. have asked for similar regulatory approval as they seek to expand offerings in the fastest-growing product in the asset-management industry. Money managers have been discouraged from introducing active ETFs, which combine security selection with the intraday trading and some of the cost-saving features of traditional ETFs, because the SEC's requirement for daily disclosure of holdings would make it easy for competitors to copy, and traders to anticipate, a manager's portfolio changes. \"We want to work with the SEC--we believe it's part of the process,\" Daniel McCabe, Precidian's chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not surprised by the fact that they have questions, but questions can be answered .\" ETF providers must disclose holdings every day to enable market makers to execute trades that keep the share price in line with the underlying value of the fund's assets. Firms including BlackRock, Precidian and Guggenheim Partners LLC proposed structures that they say would allow the funds to remain priced in line with assets, without revealing specific positions. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. in Baltimore and Boston's Eaton Vance Corp. are also among fund firms seeking SEC approval for non-transparent active ETFs. None of the applications has been approved. \"We are still pursuing our own proposal to offer non - transparent active ETFs,\" Heather McDonold, a spokeswoman for T. Rowe, said in a telephone interview. Melissa Garville, a spokeswoman for New York-based BlackRock, and Ivy McLemore, a spokesman for Guggenheim, declined to comment. Robyn Tice, a spokeswoman for Eaton Vance, and Elizabeth Bartlett for State Street Corp. didn't immediately respond to an e-mail and telephone messages seeking comment. BlackRock was one of the first U.S. fund managers to ask the SEC for approval, after spending three years crafting the product. Their leading role in seeking approval for a non - transparent active ETF has spurred excitement within asset management for the product's prospects, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual-fund and ETF research at S & P Capital IQ in New York. Mark Wiedman, BlackRock's global head of its iShares ETF unit, said in May that the firm was confident the products would work, \"but we don't actually think it will be much of a commercial opportunity .\" ", "articleID": "2014102313_00002057_W", "names": {"Kevin O'Neill": ["Q28149212", "Q3195781", "Q3195782", "Q3814839", "Q6397152"]}}]
