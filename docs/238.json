According to a new poll conducted by the University of Maryland, The Middle East and Russia: American attitudes on Trump's foreign policy, found that a strong majority of Americans (63 percent), including 44 percent of Republicans oppose moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Interestingly, the poll, which was conducted last month, suggests that an overwhelming majority of Americans, 81 percent, including 71 percent of Republicans, favor President Trump relying on experts for Middle East diplomacy instead of his son in law and former lawyer. \"Among Democrats, those who want the U.S. to take neither side of the conflict have grown to 77 percent from 69 percent last year, while the number of those who want to take Israel's side outright has dropped to only 13 percent, from 17 percent. In contrast, a majority of Republicans, 58 percent want the U.S. to take Israel's side,\" the report said. The poll also revealed that 57 percent of Democrats want to see sanctions or \"more serious action\" over Israeli settlement construction, while 43 percent of Americans support imposing sanctions or more serious actions. The competing claims to East Jerusalem, the section of the city captured by Israel in 1967, have frequently boiled over into deadly violence over the years. East Jerusalem is home to the city's most sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, as well as its 330,000 Palestinian residents. The U.S. has never endorsed Israel's claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has insisted its status be resolved through Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning Tuesday. America's consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem's Old City or the West Bank and urged American citizens, in general, to avoid places with increased police or military presence. Trump, as a presidential candidate, repeatedly promised to move the U.S. Embassy. However, U.S. leaders have routinely and unceremoniously delayed such a move since President Bill Clinton signed a law in 1995 stipulating that the U.S. must relocate its diplomatic presence to Jerusalem unless the commander in chief issues a waiver on national security grounds. Key national security advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have urged caution, according to officials, who said Trump has been receptive to some of their concerns. According to a Reuters report on Tuesday, several U.S. officials had said on condition of anonymity that news of the plan to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital had kicked up resistance from the State Department's Near Eastern Affairs Bureau (NEA), which deals with the region. \"Senior [officials] in the NEA and a number of ambassadors from the region expressed their deep concern about doing this,\" said one official, saying that the concerns focused on \"security .\" Another U.S. official said the consensus the U.S. intelligence estimates on the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital was that it would risk triggering a backlash against Israel and also potentially against U.S. interests in the Middle East, the Reuters report added.

The Italian has won two of his four games in charge and has helped rejuvenate the Toffees after a sticky spell under <mark>Marco Silva</mark>. Ancelotti is a man who needs little introducing. The manager has worked at Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Napoli to name a few and during his exceptional career has won three Champions Leagues, four domestic league trophies, seven domestic cups, and 20 trophies overall. Ancelotti has been praised in the past for his versatility in choosing formations and the personal relationships he builds with his players. The Italian is known to be fond of playing two up front and this has been evident in his start at Everton with Dominic Calvert-Lewin featuring alongside either Richarlison or Moise Kean in three of the manager's four games in charge. Life at Goodison Park has begun relatively well for Ancelloti as he won his first two games in charge 1-0 at home to Burnley and 2-1 away at Newcastle. His first defeat came in a 2-1 loss away against current champions Manchester City but the club's most recent loss against Liverpool in the FA Cup has drawn the most criticism. An almost full-strength Everton side lost 1-0 at Anfield against a youthful Liverpool team with seven players featuring under the age of 23. Following the game Ancelotti said he spoke to his players about what they must do to find a solution and labelled their second-half performance \"not good enough .' Throughout Ancelotti's 25-year managerial career his focus has been to sustain European and domestic success which he achieved winning a plethora of silverware. Everton is a new challenge for Ancelloti as his new role is to help revitalise an underperforming Everton-side with the long term aim of breaking into the top-6. Dawson strike proves Horsham is the place to see incredible goals He had a similar objective at Napoli as the side looked to threaten Juventus' recent dominance in Italy. He somewhat achieved this with Napoli finishing second in his first season but the club were still 11-points behind Juventus. Ancelloti eventually ended up getting sacked last month after a 4-0 win against Belgian-side Genk as Napoli secured their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Some saw Ancelloti's sacking as harsh but Everton fans won't be complaining as they have appointed arguably one of the greatest managers in world football. The Italian is no stranger to praise with Chelsea manager <mark>Frank Lampard</mark> complimenting his former manager following Ancelotti's dismissal at Napoli. <mark>Lampard</mark> said:\" I have huge respect for him...I think he can work anywhere in the world at the top level. \"Pep Guardiola is another Premier League manager who also admires the Italian. He said:\" Carlo is one of the smartest guys. He is always able, it doesn't matter the team, to make them work. I think it is incredible news for English football (that) he is back and I think he can make an incredible job there. \"Bringing in the Italian as manager has shown real ambition from the Toffees and after years of investment it looks as if their dream of consistent European football may be on the horizon. Brighton can expect organised, direct football from Everton on Saturday but the team comes alive in the final third. This has been Ancelloti's philosophy for many years and it has been evident in Everton's start under him. Calvert-Lewin is a player who will be on Brighton's radar going into the game as the striker has scored three goals in his four games under Ancelotti. The striker also scored at the Amex back in October so Graham Potter and his side already know the damage he can cause. Calvert-Lewin has also praised Ancelotti since his arrival telling Match of the Day:\" He has a presence about him. That is just from the man he is and what he has done in football. To be working with him on a daily basis is a privilege. \"Brighton could jump up to tenth on Saturday if results go their way and Potter will be focused on getting back-to-back wins against the Toffees whereas Ancelloti will be looking to get his team back to winning ways.

The B.C. environment ministry said the discharge reached the ocean through a creek, several beaver-dam-created wetlands and Banks Lake before entering the ocean at Surrey Bay, but it is not believed it will harm humans or animals. The Yellow Giant incident is the latest of several mine-waste spills--although much smaller in magnitude--since the catastrophic dam failure at Imperial Metals' Mount Polley gold and copper mine in August 2014. There have been small spills at the Myra Falls and Copper Mountain mines in the past year. First Nations and conservationists are concerned about the effect of this latest spill on animals and aquatic life, including salmon, at the island about 100 kilometres south of Prince Rupert. Pacific Wild executive director <mark>Ian McAllister</mark>, who lives in the area, visited the island on Sunday to get a first-hand look. Although he was blocked from the mine site by company personnel, a drone flight he carried out showed migrating salmon splashing in Banks Creek on their way to Banks Lake. There were also salmon jumping in the ocean at the mouth of the river, six to nine metres wide, he said, noting the area is rich in biodiversity, home to herring, a unique population of sandhill cranes and genetically distinct wolves. \"Whatever discharged into the system has gone into what appears to be a very productive salmon river,\" <mark>McAllister</mark> said. Gitxaala First Nation chief Clarence Innis said they will be launching legal action against Banks Island Gold and the province to ensure environmental damage caused by the spill is cleaned up. The area is an important salmon area for the Gitxaala, as well as for other foods such as seaweed gathering, he said. \"B.C. has to stop letting this industry essentially self-regulate themselves and start holding them accountable,\" Innis said Sunday, adding they plan to carry out their own assessment of the spill. Toxicity testing by a third-party laboratory on undiluted tailings effluent showed 100 per cent survival for rainbow trout and Daphnia magna (sometimes called a water flea), according to the environment ministry. \"Based on the toxicity test results, the distance to the ocean, the tendency for suspended sediments to settle out in wetlands, and dilution capacity of Surrey Bay, there is no reason to believe that there would be any risk to humans or animals,\" ministry spokesman David Karn said in a written statement. The environment ministry has ordered the company to clean up the spill, monitor its effects and come up with a long-term plan to ensure it does not happen again. The Yellow Giant mine, owned by Vancouver-based Banks Island Gold, went into commercial production in January. On July 15, the Ministry of Energy of Mines issued a shutdown order to the mine that did not become public until late last week. \"[The mine] is shut down until an updated water management plan (including all water sources from exploration sites), tailings management plan, and erosion and sediment control plans are provided and accepted by the chief inspector of mines,\" ministry spokesman Dan Gilmore said in a written statement Sunday. That shutdown order followed a July 10 order from the environment ministry for Yellow Giant to stop releasing pollution into the environment. The province said the company had \"unauthorized\" discharges of effluent in March and also effluent and tailings discharges in June and again in July. & copy; Copyright Times Colonist \"This should be not an election issue,...Jul 25, 2015 Get the day's top Times Colonist headlines emailed to you every day at 9 a.m. Markets The Times Colonist is looking for people to deliver flyers every Thursday...Your timescolonist.com"}, {"articleID": "2012100920_00070920_W", "names": {"Mike Miller": ["Q16185439", "Q16213405", "Q19667639", "Q2064643", "Q25190524", "Q380541", "Q6848025", "Q6848026", "Q6848027", "Q6848031"]}, "date": "2012-10-09", "url": "http://wgnradio.com/sports/breaking/sfl-miami-heat-nba-china-s100912,0,6892922.story?track=rss", "content": "with his players' internal clocks turned upside down by the 12-hour time difference between south florida and beijing, legs right. the heat held a short workout at the mastercard center before moving on to some sightseeing at the summer palace and great wall in advance of thursday's exhibition against the los angeles clippers in beijing. after sitting out sunday's preseason-opening road loss to the for wade, a thursday appearance is particularly significant, with his new li-ning line of sneakers to formally be unveiled wednesday in beijing. \"i hope so,\" wade told heat tv in beijing, when asked if thursday would mark his return from july arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. he also sat out last wednesday's intra-squad scrimmage at americanairlines arena. \"if i continue to respond the way it is, and my trainers and doctors give me a go-ahead to play, i would love to get out there and at least play at least some minutes, try to get my conditioning .\" the biggest thing is to get my legs back and my conditioning back. hopefully i can be at the start of that journey soon. \"spoelstra would not commit yet to a thursday appearance by wade, sunday having started <mark>mike miller</mark> in place of wade\" we want to be patient, \"spoelstra said,\" we want to be smart, but we want to be aggressive, as well. so we start working a little more each day. but we're still at a point where we're reading it day to day. \"the heat arrived shortly before 10 p.m. beijing time monday, after a 14 1/2 - hour flight from atlanta, then reported for tuesday's practice at 9 a.m. lebron james said,\" which should happen at this point. but we worked through a lot of it today. \"spoelstra said it was important to get back on the court .\" we wanted to get 'em out of bed, get up 'em up and running, and sweat and get some conditioning in, \"he said .\" but, at the same time, we didn't want them to just come in here and run lines. we wanted to get some thinking. \"so we worked on some of our execution, details of our offense, moving the ball, those habits that will ring true the entire year. we had a productive day. it's only about an hour and 20 minutes, but it is fast-paced without a break .\" spoelstra said to expect more at wednesday's practice. \"we didn't go contact today. we'll get to that tomorrow,\" he said. \"but after being on an airplane for 16 hours and then going to bed last night, sleeping for another four, five, six, whatever it was, the guys were anxious to get in here and run .\" wade said the sessions are beneficial. \"everything is coming along well,\" he said. \"i'm happy with the way i've been able to progress since camp started .\" bill leff busts the top ten food myths, and discusses an unbelievable food truth bill leff talks with actor kevin sorbo about his battle back from a medical condition that nearly killed him"}, {"articleID": "2015042112_00018389_W", "names": {"Jon Gilbert": ["Q6270757", "Q6270762"]}, "date": "2015-04-20", "url": "http://dunstabletoday.co.uk/cracking-down-on-stalkers-1-6698741", "content": "Use another account with your email account Almost Done! {* #socialRegistrationForm *} {* socialRegistration_firstName *} {* socialRegistration_lastName *} {* socialRegistration_emailAddress *} {* socialRegistration_displayName *} We have sent a confirmation email to {* traditionalRegistration_firstName *} {* traditionalRegistration_lastName *} {* traditionalRegistration_emailAddress *} {* traditionalRegistration_password *} {* traditionalRegistration_passwordConfirm *} {* traditionalRegistration_displayName *} Enter your email and we'll send you a link to reset your password. {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} We didn't recognise that password reset code.

Stalking and harassment affects millions of people in the UK and can have a devastating impact on victims, in some cases forcing them to change their daily routines and behaviours. Bedfordshire Police's investigations relating to stalking and harassment can sometimes be linked to some of the most serious crimes the force deals with, but it is keen to help residents spot the signs and ensure any suspicious activity is reported at an early stage. Stalking can be defined as persistent and unwanted attention causing a victim to feel pestered and harassed, and can affect people of all ages, ethnic origins and genders. Figures suggest 80 per cent of stalking victims are women, while one fifth (20 per cent) are men. In more than 80 per cent of cases, the victims are stalked by someone they know - whether it be a former partner, work colleague, family member or acquaintance. In addition, the threat posed by advances in technology has allowed for stalking to translate from the real world into cyberspace. As well as physical stalking behaviours such as following and watching victims, the crime now also takes place in the virtual world, with offenders targeting victims through persistent calls, disturbing emails and text messages and social media abuse, sometimes referred to as \"trolling'. Detective Superintendent <mark>Jon Gilbert</mark>, leading Bedfordshire Police's Cybercrime team, said:\" Stalking has become a cyber-enabled crime, allowing offenders to seek out their victims using social media and various technological means. \"Many of us now live our lives through Facebook and Twitter, but for those who have been a victim of trolling or persistent messaging, these social networks are a platform for distressing and often terrifying harassment .\" My message to stalkers - whether you are acting in real life or online - is that if you follow this threatening course of conduct, beware that this issue will be reported to us and we will take action against you. \"Bedfordshire Police will be posting information and advice relating to stalking throughout this week, using its Facebook page www.facebook.com/bedspolice and Twitter account @ BedsPolice. To follow all the tweets surrounding the initiative, follow the hashtag #NSAW 2015. The posts will feature facts and tips to encourage victims to come forward and report crimes, as well as personal safety messages for all Bedfordshire residents to help them spot the signs of stalking. If you think you are being stalked, seek advice from Bedfordshire Police or report an incident by calling 101.
