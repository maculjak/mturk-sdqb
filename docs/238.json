ACTOR Callan Mulvey relishes every day he's on a film set, even when he's getting his \"arse kicked\". The Auckland-born actor, who moved to Australia at the age of eight and is best known locally for his starring roles in Heartbreak High, Rush and Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms, has found success in Hollywood since moving to the US last year. The 39-year-old made his international feature film debut as a member of the US Navy's famed SEAL Team 6 in Zero Dark Thirty alongside Aussies Nash and Joel Edgerton. Now the film roles are, well, rolling in. Just last month he was shirtless, and bulked up, in the release of Greek action drama 300: Rise of an Empire. And now he's getting his butt served to him by none other than Captain America himself in the latest Marvel film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Callan Mulvey, left, and <mark>Jack O'Connell</mark> in 300: Rise of an Empire. \"I've been working pretty solidly, which is great,\" Mulvey told APN from his home in LA. \"It certainly helps having 300 and Captain America coming out and having a presence in this market. It has really sped things along .\" Mulvey has the rare honour of signing on for a sequel which fans and critics have hailed as being better than its predecessor. Directors Anthony and <mark>Joe Russo</mark> have clearly hit on a winning formula and have already signed on to direct a third Captain America film. \"Apart from Joss Whedon, they were the only directors Marvel invited to come back,\" Mulvey said. Mulvey's character Jack Rollins is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who goes into the field with Captain America, but ultimately answers to Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). He features prominently in a scene where some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents turn on Captain America in a fight sequence in a lift. \"I certainly had a few fight scenes where I got my arse kicked by other people, which was fun,\" he said. Mulvey's bruised and beaten character can be seen top right. \"I had probably two or three lines (in the film), one of which made the trailer. I was very happy about that .\" It's just cool being on any set, let alone a Marvel set. You're just standing around with Robert Redford. \"While he's yet to share any scenes with another Marvel superhero, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the two actors do catch up when they can in Los Angeles. Mulvey has worked with Hemsworth's older brother Luke twice, including the upcoming Aussie indie film Kill Me Three Times. But Mulvey's career will really take off if he lands the role of Lex Luthor in next year's Batman vs Superman movie, which already stars Ben Affleck, <mark>Amy Adams</mark> and Henry Cavill.

(AP) - The annual mission trip is a big deal for the youth at Pendleton's First Assembly of God. The destination remains a mystery until the unveiling, which their leader does with flair during a youth group meeting. By the end of his verbal intro, the name of the country is projected onto a screen. This year, the students got a shock. When the moment came, the words \"Sacrifice Trip\" glowed bright. Dead silence. The teens worked out what the words meant. Pastor Kyle Chalko explained that the trip was actually a non-trip. The kids would raise money to support an existing missionary in <mark>Jordan</mark> by buying her a car and other tools she needs in her ministry. The youth had met the missionary, a woman who works with Syrian refugees, and liked her. But, still, they couldn't help but feel momentarily let down. \"I was disappointed at first,\" said Joyce Chen, 15, who had traveled to Haiti and Nicaragua on past trips. \"I love missions. When I found out we weren't going anywhere this year, it was hard for me .\" Her friends Tiffany Armstrong and Paisley Schulze echoed her sentiments. But these are kids who often approach life by getting on their knees and praying for guidance. They said they quickly came to embrace the idea of giving instead of going. Daniel Van Cleave, 18, donates money he gets from mowing lawns and simply not buying things. Armstrong, 15, gave the money she had saved for a car. Everyone figured out some way to contribute. They will continue to earn, resist buying stuff and give. \"It's a really good opportunity for all the kids at this youth group to have a big impact in a very visible way in the country of <mark>Jordan</mark>,\" Van Cleave said. \"Supplying someone with a car, it's a tangible thing. Our missionary will be able to drive where she needs to go .\" Chalko said he didn't make his decision lightly. \"I'm a huge believer in missions,\" Chalko said. \"They can see with their own eyes a tent city in Haiti or the slums in Nicaragua. It opens their eyes .\" Chalko himself had gone to Peru at age 15. The poverty he saw there stunned him and sparked a lifelong desire to do mission work. Though he loves missions, something weighed heavy on him - the cost. He wondered if the orphanages and other places they help could do more with cash than a temporary teenage workforce. \"We spend a lot of money on missions,\" he wondered. \"Is it worth it?\" Two years previous, it had cost $44,000 to transport 22 students to Haiti to help with a post-earthquake feeding program. Last year, he took 32 students to Nicaragua at a cost of $70,000. Chalko had asked the hosting pastor if he would rather have 32 kids or the money. He pondered the question. That's tough, he admitted. While he knew the transformation being done in the teens' hearts and minds, the $70,000 would allow completion of an orphanage. The pastor's comment echoed those of others who Chalko had questioned in previous years. He pulled the trigger on the sacrifice trip for just this one year. Next year, the group will likely travel again. Some of the adult church members have gotten on board. One sold an extra car that wasn't driven much. Another donated a baseball signed by <mark>Michael Jordan</mark>. The money raised will go to the <mark>Jordan</mark> missionary through the Speed the Light organization. The group uses money raised by youth ministries to buy transportation for missionaries that includes cars, donkeys and boats. The woman in <mark>Jordan</mark>, where it is illegal to be a missionary, is in the process of starting a women's - only coffee shop where she will be able to interact with Jordanian women. ___ Information from: East Oregonian, http: //www.eastoregonian.info Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

At the event, another judge praised Edwin Cameron, loftily describing their workplace as a shrine to democracy but also ribbing the colleague he sees often. \"He has assured me and reassured me that he has no crush on me,\" joked Dikgang Moseneke, the deputy chief justice and a former activist who was jailed for years during white racist rule. The audience laughed, and laughed more when Cameron stepped to the microphone and said: \"I'm actually blushing .\" The banter captured the ideal of openness in the South African court, anchor of a constitution widely seen as one of the most progressive in the world because of its commitment to equality, operating in an inevitably imperfect society that struggles to fulfill expectations 20 years after the end of white racist rule. Cameron's own story as a man who publicly stated he has the virus that causes AIDS and later joined the nation's highest court exemplifies the possibility of South Africa, in contrast with growing intolerance toward gays in Uganda, Nigeria and some other African countries. Many of the 11 judges on the Constitutional Court were activists in the fight against apartheid that culminated in the first all-race elections in 1994, Cameron said in an interview in his office with The Associated Press. He worked as a human rights lawyer during the tumultuous last chapter of white rule and has campaigned for gay rights. \"You sit on a court with judicial capacities and judicial constraints, but you also have known injustice yourself and grown up and worked professionally in the acute awareness of it. So that's what makes it different,\" Cameron said. He described South Africans as skeptical, outspoken and politicized, saying those qualities are the beneficial fallout of challenging apartheid for decades. \"We are not quiescent,\" said 61-year-old Cameron, who joined the Constitutional Court in 2009. \"Unlike Zimbabwe, unlike Swaziland, it's our angry population that is our safeguard against authoritarianism and dictatorship. I think that's a tremendous plus .\" South Africa often deliberates to what extent past racial injustice hurts its ability to overcome crime, corruption, poverty and other challenges even as it boasts a stable electoral system and one of Africa's biggest economies. The debate is intensifying ahead of ceremonies later this month for the 20th anniversary of the end of apartheid and elections in May. In \"Justice: A Personal Account,\" Cameron traces the hardship of his early life - his father in jail, a sister killed in a road accident, time spent in a children's home - through a top education that only whites were entitled to, his discovery of the law as a way to repair a racially torn society and his own life, as well the 1986 discovery that he was HIV positive. He fell ill a decade later, but anti-retroviral treatment restored him and today he helps AIDS charities and children's homes and is a passionate cyclist. Cameron's upward journey illustrates the promise of South Africa's constitutional law, influenced by codes in Germany, Canada, India, Namibia and elsewhere. South Africa is one of the few countries to guarantee the right to food, water, housing and other basics, though recent protests for government services indicate these are hard commitments to keep. \"The person on the public road burning tires to stop passing traffic because of service delivery protests feel they deserve more under the constitution, and they articulate it that way,\" Cameron said. \"There's a fiery demand for government to improve itself, and in a paradoxical way, that is not a bad thing .\" In the book, he describes the court's key 2002 ruling during the country's AIDS epidemic that a reluctant government must make anti-retroviral drugs available. Cameron was part of a 2011 majority ruling that said a move to bring an elite crime-busting team under police supervision was unconstitutional because its independence would be compromised. The judge said he was worried about \"endemic, almost pervasive corruption\" in South Africa, the diminishing effectiveness of some state agencies and economic inequality, even though the middle class has grown. Cameron has an elegant manner, yet writes with blunt honesty. He describes childhood memories of urinating with his legs primly together, a habit he calls \"girlish\" and \"exactly right for me\" as his sexuality developed. In the AP interview, he said opening up has been a 30-year process, starting with his \"coming out\" as a gay and acknowledging, in a terrifying, liberating moment, that he was HIV positive in 1999. He is, however, troubled by threats to homosexual rights elsewhere in Africa. Uganda and Nigeria recently passed laws strengthening criminal penalties against gay sex. \"There's absolutely no doubt that the end of this is going to be a recognition that homosexuality is as African as it is human anywhere in the world,\" Cameron said. \"Whether that's going to take another 20 years or 30 years or in my grieving moments, 40 years even, I don't know .\" ", "articleID": "2014040622_00036074_W", "names": {"Ivan Lopez": ["Q37377397", "Q3804960", "Q5923485", "Q6100103"]}}, {"date": "2014-04-07", "url": "http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Vavi-vows-to-unify-Cosatu-after-his-return-20140407", "content": "Not just in Earth Hour We should reduce artificial light throughout the year, says Mandi Smallhorne.

Food and Allied Workers' Union (Fawu) members surrounded Vavi, singing as he stepped out of his car outside the building. On Friday, the High Court in Johannesburg set aside Vavi's suspension. Judge Phineas Mojapelo ruled that it was invalid and that the Cosatu constitution had been breached because the decisions to suspend Vavi and investigate his conduct were not put to the vote at the central executive committee (CEC) meeting where they were made. \"A vote is prescribed as the manner in which decisions are to be taken...therefore no valid decisions were taken,\" Mojapelo found. Vavi was placed on special leave in August, pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing relating to his affair with a junior employee. In July, the employee accused him of rape. He said they had an affair. The woman later withdrew a sexual harassment complaint against him. Decision challenged Following Vavi's suspension, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa), an ally of his, lodged an application in the High Court in Johannesburg challenging the decision. Vavi then lodged papers to be added as an applicant in Numsa's challenge. Cosatu will discuss the judgment and the way forward at a special CEC meeting on Tuesday. Numsa's position in Cosatu is also expected to be on the agenda. Last week, Numsa wrote to Cosatu demanding that it convene a special national congress, and threatened to take the matter to court if it did not. On Monday, Vavi thanked union members for their warm welcome. \"Last week Friday was about defining the basic...rule of law...we [are] thankful we came out triumphant .\" Your power has brought me back to where you have elected me to be. \"Vavi said it was a difficult day because his daughter was being operated on after an accident last week in the Eastern Cape, but he was excited to be back at work. Wanting to unify Cosatu He said he was returning to Cosatu not with vengeance in mind, but to unify the trade union federation .\" I'm acutely aware of my responsibility to build the unity of the federation, \"Vavi said .\" I recognise an un-unified Cosatu is not in the best interest [of workers]. Our challenge here is to unify the federation, to unify progressive forces. \"He called on people to forget what he called the\" political shenanigans \"of the past .\" Forgive them, because they don't know what they do, \"Vavi said. Fawu members followed Vavi into the building and up to the ninth floor, which is the secretariat office. Vavi stood singing with union members in the foyer outside his office. 24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our AnswerIt Get your financial questions answered.

Thad Cochran's latest TV ad says he is the \"only\" candidate with a \"100 percent pro-life voting record from National Right to Life .\" Not so. He has voted against the NRLC five times since 1997 - notably on stem cell research - for a 92 percent score, not 100 percent. The claim is also misleading, because Cochran is the incumbent in the race, so of course he is the \"only one\" included in the NRLC congressional scorecard. Chris McDaniel's campaign responded to the ad by claiming Cochran has supported \"taxpayer funding for abortions .\" That's a stretch. Cochran has a long record - reflected in the NRLC scorecard and elsewhere - of opposing taxpayer-funded abortions. The McDaniel campaign rests its case on three votes in the 1980s, and there's more to those votes than meets the eye. Not the \"Only One' The Mississippi Senate primary has attracted national attention as a test of the tea party and its ability to challenge a six-term senator, has the support of the state's top party leaders - including former Gov. Haley Barbour. Barbour was chairman of the Republican National Committee and is now FreedomWorks. Cochran's campaign went on the air April 2 with a 30-second TV spot called\" Only One. \"The ad stresses Cochran's conservative voting record on three issues: guns, abortion and the Affordable Care Act. The ad says\" only one candidate has a 100 percent pro-life voting record from National Right to Life. That conservative candidate is Thad Cochran. \"On the screen, voters see these words,\" 100% Pro-Life Voting Record, \"with the URL for the National Right to Life homepage in small print. current Congress - and the two prior congressional sessions that ended in 2010 - but that has not always been the case. The ad does not provide a time frame, so a viewer may come away with the mistaken impression that Cochran voted with the NRLC on every issue. Jordan Russell, a spokesman for the Cochran campaign, said the ad was referring to the current Congress. But, for example, the senator also scored 85 percent in the 110th - so the campaign does some cherry-picking with the record. 59 times with the NRLC and five times against it since 1997, according to the NRLC website cited by the TV ad. (That's as far back as the website goes, even though Cochran has been in the Senate for 36 years and served almost six years in the House before that .) That's a 92 percent score during the last 17 years, from 1997 to 2013 - which indicates strong support of the organization's legislative agenda, but not 100 percent. He has voted multiple times for a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, voted against repealing a ban on abortions at military facilities, and he has His votes against the National Right to Life have come on stem cell research and campaign finance legislation. Cochran voted for the voted against an amendment offered by Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana in 1997 that would have banned federal funding for research that uses embryonic tissue, cells or organs from induced abortions. Cochran was also one of 14 Republicans who As the National Journal put it in 2012:\" As former head of the GOP caucus, Cochran is usually a reliable Republican vote, but he has crossed party lines, such as when he opposed restrictions on stem cell research. \"other votes against the National Right to Life, Cochran voted in 2001 and 2002 to give final approval to campaign finance bills that the NRLC said would restrict the group's freedom of speech. In a spirited exchange with a Cochran critic on its Facebook webpage, the Mississippi Right to Life defends Cochran and refers to his votes against the NRLC as\" in the far distant past. \"\"We have two really good pro-life candidates here whose candidate questionnaires and records we will be publishing as we get closer to election time but we will NOT allow this page to be used by either side to spread hate and discontent,\" the Mississippi Right to Life says. That leads us to our second point: Both candidates are anti-abortion, but Cochran is the \"only one\" scored by the National Right to Life, because it is a congressional scorecard based on votes in Congress. The ad omits that. The fact is that McDaniel has a strong record opposing abortion, too, and his supporters, not surprisingly, argue it is stronger. McDaniel, for example, supported the state's failed \"personhood amendment\" in 2011 that would have defined \"person\" from the moment of fertilization. The ballot initiative was defeated, but it sparked a heated debate among opponents who believed it was unconstitutional and supporters who believed it was a moral imperative. (We could find no record of Cochran taking a position on the statewide ballot initiative, and neither could his campaign spokesman Jordan Russell. \"As far as I can tell, Senator Cochran has never weighed in on a state ballot initiative,\" Russell told us .) Statewide Initiative Measure No. 26 - at an event sponsored by the Center for Pregnancy Choices of South Central Mississippi, Laurel Leader-Call, June 4, 2011: McDaniel said he favors the Personhood Amendment and anything else that promotes the pro-life message. \"It's important to discuss it so everyone can understand it,\" he said. McDaniel's record in the Mississippi Senate also includes co-sponsoring a bill in 2013 that would require a doctor's prescription for an \"abortion inducing drug,\" and sponsoring a bill in 2012 that would have prohibited abortions without \"informed written consent\" if the fetal heartbeat can be detected. In 2010, he co-sponsored a bill that would have outlawed all abortions in Mississippi except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Cochran and Taxpayer-Funded Abortions In response to the Cochran \"Only One\" ad, McDaniel spokesman Noel Fritsch says in an April 1 press release that Cochran has supported \"taxpayer funding for abortions .\" It's a claim that the campaign has made than once, and it's an exaggeration. When we asked for evidence, the McDaniel campaign cited three votes in the 1980s restricting the use of taxpayer funds for abortions through Medicaid. Cochran has a decades-long history of supporting such restrictions. Nevertheless, the McDaniel campaign cited two votes on the so-called Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding of certain abortions through Medicaid, and a third vote on an amendment restricting the District of Columbia from spending its own money on abortions. Let's take the Hyde amendment votes first - starting with a little background on the amendment, Cochran's early voting record on it, and the legislative skirmishes over exceptions to it that form the basis of McDaniel's claim. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, was enacted in 1976 as an amendment to the appropriations bill that funds Medicaid and has been added to annual spending bills ever since. But from the beginning there have been fights over the wording of the amendment and whether it should allow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the life of the mother. On June 24, 1976, the House took two votes on the Hyde amendment. The language said, \"None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to pay for abortions or to promote or encourage abortions .\" No exceptions. The House passed it both times that day. First it passed 207 to 167 with 57 members, including Cochran, not voting (pages 20413 in the Congressional Record). Later that day it passed again 199 to 165, with 67 members not voting (page 20425). Cochran voted for it the second time, and the bill went to the Senate. The Senate insisted on exceptions to the Hyde amendment and, in a compromise, the House voted 256 to 114 on Sept. 16, 1976, (page 30901) to provide an exception \"where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term .\" Cochran voted for that, too, and that became the law. A year later, there was an attempt by the Senate again to broaden the exceptions. On Dec. 7, 1977, Cochran voted (then-Rep. George Mahon of Texas to accept a Senate amendment that would expand the exceptions to include rape and incest. The motion failed, by a 171-178 tally, but that same day the House voted 181 to 167 to pass compromise language that added the new exceptions \"when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service .\" Cochran also voted (law for fiscal year 1978. So, over the course of two years, Cochran voted for three versions of the Hyde amendment: one without exceptions; one with only an exception for the endangerment of the mother; and one with exceptions for rape, incest and the endangerment of the mother. But in every case he voted for a ban on federal funding of abortions through Medicaid. The McDaniel campaign cites two of Cochran's votes during similar skirmishes in 1981 and 1989. We'll take them in chronological order. In 1981, then-Sen. Jesse Helms sponsored an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill that would have dropped the rape and incest exceptions added to the Hyde amendment in fiscal 1978. Russell, of the Cochran campaign, tells us the senator's vote against the amendment was on procedural grounds, not because he opposed the amendment. Russell says Cochran, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, supported then-chairman <mark>Mark Hatfield</mark>'s position that the abortion provision should be taken up separately and not as part of the appropriations bill. <mark>Hatfield</mark> said during the debate that it was time for the abortion issue to be taken up in separate legislation because the Associated Press wrote of the disputed roll call vote: \"Some Senators who supported Helms in principle voted against him on procedural grounds .\" We cannot independently confirm that Cochran cast his vote on procedural grounds, because the senator did not speak on the bill during the floor debate. But as a member of the appropriations committee he would have been likely to support the committee process and the chairman. Plus, his voting history to this point shows his support for the Hyde amendment - and the same is true for <mark>Hatfield</mark> and some others who voted against the Helms amendment. Finally, Cochran did vote for the final bill, which included the Helms amendment and became law. The spending bill Cochran's vote in the Senate on Oct. 19, 1989, for an appropriations bill that included House language that would have restored the exceptions for rape and incest that were stripped out by Helms in 1981. Fritsch, McDaniel's spokesman, says in an email to us that Cochran's vote in 1989 expanded federal funding for abortion, so that justifies the campaign's claim that Cochran voted for taxpayer-funded abortions. But in this case, there was no direct vote on the abortion language. The Senate agreed to it in a voice vote a few weeks before the final vote on the $156.7 billion appropriations bill, so we don't know how he would have voted on the abortion language. It's possible he would have voted for it, given his votes in 1977 to allow exceptions in cases of rape and incest. But, even though Cochran voted for exceptions to the Hyde amendment, he still supported the funding ban - which is not the action of someone who supports taxpayer-funded abortions. It turned out to be a moot point, anyway. President George H.W. Bush vetoed the bill because of the abortion language and Congress failed to override it. The House language was removed - until 1993. The third vote cited by the McDaniel campaign came Nov. 7, 1985, on an amendment offered by Congressional Research Service, annual spending bills for the District from fiscal 1980 to 1988 included language prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the mother's life. In 1985, Humphrey offered an amendment that would have barred the District from spending federal and local funds for abortion services, except when the life of the mother is in danger. Critics of the amendment cited home rule and claimed it would set a bad precedent by dictating how the District could spend its own money. The Washington Post, reporting on the amendment, said that \"15 states use their own funds to pay for abortions .\" By a 54-41 vote, the Senate voted to table the Humphrey amendment - which blocked the amendment from even coming up for a vote. Cochran and 17 other Republicans joined 36 Democrats to table the amendment. It wasn't until fiscal 1989 that Congress imposed a ban on the use of locally raised funds to pay for abortions, except if the mother's life is in danger. Under the threat of a presidential veto, the Senate voted 45-44 on Sept. 30, 1988, to add abortion language to the District appropriations bill. Cochran voted for it, so his position had changed since the 1985 vote. And his vote was critical in passing the legislation. McDaniel doesn't mention that vote. The ban on using local funds for abortion remained in place through fiscal 1993. Some type of ban - either on the use of federal funds or federal and local funds - has been in place every year since fiscal 1980, depending on party control of the White House and Congress. Cochran's abortion record isn't perfect, as the NRLC scorecard shows and we noted in the section on Cochran's TV ad. But the scorecard also shows the senator has repeatedly sided with the group on issues it considers to be federal funding of abortion: Planned Parenthood, which provides family planning, abortion services and other women's health services. supported the so-called Mexico City Policy, which at one time barred federal funding for family planning services to groups that provide abortion services overseas. (The policy dates to the Reagan administration and has been periodically enforced, depending on the president prohibit federal employee health insurance plans from paying for abortion services except to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. (That ban was first instituted in 1984, which is outside the scope of the NRLC scorecard. But we found in the Congressional Record, page 31947, that Cochran supported the ban at the outset, voting on Nov. 10, 1983, against an amendment to strip the House bill of the anti-abortion language .) supported the NRLC's position against U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund. ban funding of abortion services in American Indian health care programs. Cochran has cast multiple votes against the Affordable Care Act that were in line with NRLC's position on the use of federal funds. When someone has been in office as long as Cochran has - 41 years - there will be votes that his opponents can use against him. Some establish a track record and point to legitimate differences between candidates. Cochran did, after all, repeatedly support federal funding for stem cell research, and it hurt his perfect score that he falsely touts. Other votes are cherry-picked and used to build a false narrative about the incumbent. That's the case with McDaniel's exaggerated claim that Cochran supports \"taxpayer funding for abortions .\" Does the Affordable Care Act require Medicare beneficiaries over age 75 to be admitted to the hospital by their primary care physician?", "articleID": "2014040904_00052518_W", "names": {"Mark Hatfield": ["Q6767961", "Q879921"]}}, {"date": "2014-04-11", "url": "http://www.news24.com/World/News/Italy-reports-900-migrants-rescued-at-sea-20140411-9", "content": "Learn Italian the Fast and Fun Way [With DictionaryWith Flash Cards] Learn to speak, write and read Italian in a fast and fun way with dictionary and flash cards. Now R218 .00 Rome - Italy has rescued 896 migrants crossing the Mediterranean by boat overnight, the navy said on Friday, after the government warned of an \"emergency\" caused by a surge in new arrivals. Three navy warships and two coast guard patrol boats took on the migrants in the Mediterranean and they were then transferred to other vessels and taken to ports in Sicily, the navy said in a statement. In Geneva, the UN refugee agency UNHCR estimated 6 000 people had been rescued by the Italian navy from over 40 overcrowded boats in the past four days. UNHCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming said the migrants had set off from northern Libya \"and many were fleeing violence, conflict and persecution\". \"Main countries of origin include Syria, Eritrea, Somalia, Nigeria, Gambia, Mali and Senegal,\" she said. Syrians made up the highest number landing in Italy in 2013 with over 11 300 arrivals reported. The anti-immigration Northern League, a small but vociferous opposition party, has called for migrants to be sent back and, along with a series of far-right parties, accuses the government of failing to act. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has appealed for more assistance from the European Union but migrant rights campaigners say the real fault is with failures in Italy's immigration and asylum system. 24. com publishes all comments posted on articles provided that they adhere to our Alcohol killed my mother A young woman shares her pain of growing up with an alcoholic mother.

One of the assumptions I made in those scenarios was that Dallas would defeat San Antonio last night. So I threw it on the ground. Because I'm an adult and not a part of your system I had almost a fully flushed out word document with the new scenarios which took into account the Dallas loss - then Golden State lost to the Nuggets. That loss brought all sorts of other tiebreaker scenarios to the forefront and broke my brain entirely. But since I'm nice - here's roughly where we are tiebreaker wise: Suns/Mavericks - head to head even at 1-1, winner of Saturday's game wins the tiebreaker. Suns/Grizzlies - Grizzlies are up 3-0 on head to head and have already won the tiebreaker. Grizzlies/Mavericks - Mavericks are up 3-0 head to head and have already won the tiebreaker. Suns/Warriors - head to head is even at 2-2 so we move to the next tiebreaker for teams in the same division - division record, which is clinched by GSW already (10-5 to 7-8). Suns/Mavs/Grizz - the tiebreaker is record in games among the three teams, Dallas is 4-1, Memphis is 3-3, and Phoenix is 1-4. Each team has 2 to play. The only way this goes well for the Suns is if Memphis loses their last 2 and the Suns win their last 2 but if that happens there won't be a 3 way tie anyway. Suns/Grizz/Warriors - same three way tiebreaker. Memphis is 5-2 (2-2 against GSW, 3-0 against Phoenix), Golden State is 4-4 (2-2 against Phoenix/Memphis), and Phoenix is 2-5 (0-3 against Memphis, 2-2 against GSW). Suns would be dead here. Suns/Mavs/Warriors - same three way tiebreaker. Golden State is 5-3 (2-2 against Phoenix, 3-1 against Dallas), Phoenix is 3-3 (2-2 against Golden State, 1-1 against Dallas), and Dallas is 2-4 (1-1 against Phoenix, 1-3 against Golden State). In the highly unlikely (and potentially impossible event the Suns lose to Dallas and tie these teams, they're done. If any of that is wrong feel free to correct me - I'm sitting in a staff meeting at the moment. Thursday April 10th Key Western Conference Results: Recap) - <mark>Tony Parker</mark> didn't play for the Spurs but it didn't matter. Hell Patty Mills took 25 shots and only scored 26 points and it still didn't matter (although it helped he shot 6/11 from three). The Spurs are really good at winning games. Monta Ellis led the Mavericks with 24 points and you're not reading this part so I'm just going to go into a shopping list - I need cereal and milk. I like cereals with cartoon mascots on the box. Recap) - I'll admit I barely even bothered to watch this game because I thought the Full Squad would take care of business. The Nuggets trailed this game by as many as 12 in the 3rd quarter but the heavenly ascension of Timofey Mosgov (23 points and 29 - yes 29 - rebounds) allowed them to keep it close. It looked like Golden State was going to survive when Steph Curry hit a floater with 5 seconds left but Denver got the ball into Kenneth Faried who hit a shot in the lane to take the game. Steph Curry led Golden State with 24 points and Klay Thompson added 21. LOST 1 - Memphis 46 Friday April 11th Western Conference Games of Significance: Suns @ Spurs - At this point of the morning we don't really even know who's going to play for either team. Coro reported that Dragic is questionable with an ankle injury (roughly his 10 millionth) while other reports suggest both <mark>Tony Parker</mark> and <mark>Tim Duncan</mark> are going to sit out tonight. <mark>Parker</mark> has sat the last two games while <mark>Duncan</mark> suffered a bit of a knee scare in the 1st half last night but still played 39 minutes. I don't think there's any shame in saying we have no clue what's going to happen tonight, so I'll say Spurs by 10. 76ers @ Grizzlies - I hear a lot of you say things like \"anything can happen any night in the NBA\" and \"they're all NBA players\" - but when your team has won 2 games since February started I don't think any of that applies. The Sixers are bad and they should feel bad. Memphis will win this game by 73. Need a morning laugh? Go check out the Philly roster. Warriors @ Lakers - Won't some other playoff contender sleepwalk through a game with a bad Lakers team and take a horrible loss? If so I'd really appreciate it. The odds are against Golden State suffering a second consecutive bad loss but at least the Lakers are sort of an NBA team - unlike Philly.
