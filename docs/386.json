News 21 Jun 2017, 18:47 IST Could the gimmicks be WWE-bound? What's the story? WWE Superstars Matt and <mark>Jeff Hardy</mark> were recently interviewed by WWE RAW commentator Corey Graves for a WWE NetworkSpecial titled \"Reborn by Fate: The <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz Interview\". During the interview, The <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz talked about their surprise return, their stints outside the WWE as well as the Broken gimmicks. Matt Hardy stated that whenever the Broken gimmick comes to the WWE, it would be \"the most exciting thing to hit the WWE programming for a long, long time .\" In case you didn't know...Matt and <mark>Jeff Hardy</mark>, collectively known as \"The <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz\" are a WWE tag team on the RAW brand. Prior to them returning to the WWE at WrestleMania 33, Matt and <mark>Jeff Hardy</mark> had gained popularity on the independent circuit with their \"Broken\" gimmicks. The eccentric, bizarre gimmicks were used by the <mark>Hardy</mark> brothers on Impact Wrestling as well as several other independent wrestling promotions. However, ever since the <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz left Impact Wrestling, Anthem Sports and Entertainment disallowed the usage of the broken characters and claimed ownership of the same. The Hardyz have since been embroiled in a legal controversy with Anthem over the rights to the gimmick. The heart of the matter During the interview, Corey Graves asked Matt Hardy whether it was odd for him to go back to his WWE gimmick of \"Version 1\" Matt Hardy after having been \"Broken\" Matt for such a long time. <mark>Hardy</mark> responded by saying that he felt like a broken man going back to \"plain old\" Matt Hardy, but that he will unleash his \"broken brilliance\" on the WWE Universe eventually when the time seems right. Also read: What are the \"Delete\" chants and broken gimmick of The <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz all about? Matt Hardy then added that he was optimistic about bringing the Broken characters to the WWE, despite their legal struggles over the gimmick. <mark>Hardy</mark> said that he found the response to the characters humbling and urged the WWE Universe to continue their support for the broken gimmicks. He was quoted as saying: \"I find it very flattering and humbling that every time we come wrestle in front of the WWE Universe, they chant and they address it and they acknowledge it. Please, keep doing that. I mean, we love it when they do that. And hopefully sooner than later we'll be able to go into more detail about everything. When it happens, I'm not even going to say\" if', when it happens, it's going to be the most exciting thing to hit WWE programming in a long, long time. \"What's next? The <mark>Hardy</mark> Boyz are currently feuding with Sheamus and Cesaro over the WWE RAW Tag Team Championships. Their feud is likely to carry over to the Great Balls of Fire pay-per-view, where, barring any unforeseen circumstances, the two teams will battle it out with the titles on the line. Although their match hasn't been officially announced for the pay-per-view yet, several reports and rumours have pointed towards it happening. The full interview with Matt and <mark>Jeff Hardy</mark> taken by Corey Graves can be seen on the WWE Network. Author's take The Broken Hardys were some of the most original, innovative and brilliantly written characters to have come out of the wrestling scene outside of the WWE in quite some time. It is a pity that the characters cannot be debuted on WWE TV yet despite the Hardys being on WWE already. However, it is a question of\" when \"and not\" if \"the characters will finally come to the WWE and I am no exception to the WWE Universe in my eager anticipation of that day, whenever it comes.

Updated 49 minutes ago At first a divided Greensburg Salem School Board rejected the district's 16th tax increase in 17 years Wednesday night, but eventually reversed its decision after failing to agree on another plan. Property taxes will go up one mill as originally proposed. That will cost the median taxpayer an additional $16.49 a year and bring the total millage to 88.22. Board member Richard Payha was the swing vote. He initially joined board president Ron Mellinger, Jeffrey Metrosky, Robin Savage and Barbara Vernail to vote against the tax increase. However, unlike them, he believed taxes should be higher, not lower, although he also supported spending cuts to balance the budget. \"We have to invest in the children,\" he said. After a lengthy discussion and several failed alternative proposals, Payha decided to vote for the originally proposed increase, joining Frank Gazze, Charlotte Kemerer, Nick Rullo and <mark>Stephen Thomas</mark>. After passing the tax increase, the board approved a $44.7 million 2017-18 budget, 5-4. Payha voted against the budget, saying it did not cut spending enough. Vernail, who voted against the tax increase, voted for the budget, allowing its passage. Although day-to-day expenses are covered by the tax increase, the budget had a $300,000 deficit because the district plans to use money from its reserves to pay for major renovations. After rejecting the first attempt to raise taxes, board members suggested several alternatives. \"How long are we going to keep tapping the well and taking it out on the taxpayers?\" Savage said. Payha recommended cutting supplemental money paid to teachers who take on duties outside their contract, like monitoring buses or supervising students at lunch. Mellinger proposed a half-mill tax increase instead of a full mill. Gazze suggested cutting a proposed new human resources administrator. Board members also aired longstanding budgetary grievances, against the state for mandating high payments to pension funds and charter schools, and Westmoreland County for not reassessing property values in the last 44 years. No proposal won the consensus of a majority of the board, and after a long discussion and a brief break members returned with no suggestions but to vote again on the original budget. In 2001, a Greensburg Salem taxpayer with a property worth the current median value of $16,460 paid $87.44 in school taxes. In 2017-18, that same property owner will pay $145.21--a 66 percent increase. The median household income in Westmoreland County has gone up about 44 percent over the same period, according to census data. District officials say state-mandated pension contributions are to blame for spiralling costs. If these contributions were removed, the 2017-18 budget would be $244,645 smaller than the 2009-10 budget. Mellinger said he was disappointed with the results. The board began this year's budget negotiations facing a deficit of over $600,000. It managed to reduce most of that deficit, and Mellinger believes more could have been done. \"There just has to be more,\" he said. \"If we dropped $400,000 in a month, how could we not find another $200,000? We could have had a balanced budget .\" Jacob Tierney is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

His debut film, Get Out, became the highest grossing movie in the United States by a black director (since surpassed by The Fate of the Furious), and has an outstanding 99% on Rotten Tomatoes from 272 reviews. Yes, that equates to just two negative reviews. Get Out was praised for its mix of humor, horror and social commentary, especially regarding race relations, and some have gone as far to say that the film will be a contender for a number of Academy Awards next year. And with Peele's directorial debut being such a smashing success, it is hard not to wonder whether he would double down with a sequel. Get Out was produced by Jason Blum, who is no stranger to sequels. Blum-produced films like Insidious, The Purge, Paranormal Activity and Sinister have all spawned sequels, in some cases multiple ones. But Get Out is a film that works so well as a standalone feature, that a sequel could do it a disservice. And perhaps that is why one is not being planned. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Peele was asked about his next movie, an untitled Blumhouse production with a reported $25 million budget. While Peele did not reveal much about the \"social thriller,\" he did put to bed any notion that it could be a Get Out sequel. \"I'll tell you this, it's going to be a very different movie than Get Out,\" Peele said. \"Don't expect a sequel .\" Jordan Peele shot down any expectation for a \"Get Out' sequel. Source: Rich Fury/AP As for further down the line, a natural assumption would be that Peele might direct a large-budget studio tentpole. After all, it is not unusual for a filmmaker to follow up a well-received indie pic with a massive franchise production. For instance, Colin Trevorrow went from directing the small budget Safety Not Guaranteed to the worldwide hit Jurassic World. <mark>Gareth Edwards</mark>' follow-up to Monsters, a film with a reported $500,000 budget, was Godzilla, which carried a price tag north of $150 million. And the list goes on and on. Peele, though, is in no rush to board a franchise film as director, as he explained to The Hollywood Reporter:\" The most important thing for me is maintaining as much of the virtues of the process of Get Out as possible. My goal and plan is to rise in budget slowly. It doesn't make any sense for me to jump to an enormous budget when it changes the process entirely. I pinch myself and realize how lucky I am to be able to have created something. And if i can do that again, isn't that the best? \"Perhaps someday we will see what a big-budget Jordan Peele film looks like, but for now, fans should be excited for what the Get Out director comes up with next.

I used to respond to such emails telling him to get back to bed - albeit many hours later, so they weren't that effective. I am now less shocked at the time stamp on his correspondence as I know he's an insomniac and, despite adapting his lifestyle and at times willing himself to sleep, he invariably finds himself awake at horrible hours. The only upside? He gets a crazy amount of work completed while the rest of us are sleeping. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. We all know colleagues who work long hours - the guys and girls who are always at their computers so you never know if they've actually gone home. Are long hours a prerequisite for success? My insomniac friend is hugely productive and a standout performer but I'm not sure I can say that of all those in our industry who habitually work late into the night. Some work late because it's an industry norm and nobody wants to be the first to leave the office. The work-life balance debate recently featured in a Twitter exchange between technology investor Blake Robbins, who has worked for companies like Google and SpaceX, and venture capitalist Keith Rabois, a long-time investor and employee at successful start-ups PayPal and LinkedIn. Robbins tweeted: \"When I first got into tech, I thought it was\" cool' to work on the weekends or holidays. I quickly realised that's a recipe for disaster. Not hanging with friends and family because you're working isn't cool. Burning out isn't cool. \"I promise you...your competition isn't beating you because they are working more hours than you. It's because they're working smarter .\" Rabois quickly responded: \"Totally false. Read a bio of Elon Musk. Or about Amazon. Or about the first four years of Facebook or PayPal. It is pure arrogance to believe you can outsmart other talented people .\" Rabois is at the extreme end of the \"hard work camp'. In a Stanford University class on start-up companies, he posted a slide quoting NFL coach <mark>Bill Walsh</mark>:\" How to tell if you're doing the job: If you're up at 3am every night, have a knot in your stomach, a rash on your skin and you're losing touch with your wife and kids. \"Rabois concluded:\" If this doesn't sound appetising, you probably shouldn't start a company. \"At the other end of the debate are psychologists who point to the\" labour illusion'; it says people routinely confuse effort with results - to the point where effort is over-appreciated relative to the actual outcome. Psychology writer Oliver Burkeman says, contrary to the thinking that a jammed schedule equates to high productivity, it has been very well demonstrated that in certain fields - particularly those requiring creativity - less \"work\" can actually lead to more value. There is, I think, a middle ground. Work hard - harder than your competitors - but don't go crazy. Mathematician Richard Hamming once lectured on how people can do great work, \"Nobel-Prize type of work\". \"Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10 per cent more than the other, the latter will more than twice out-produce the former.

Researchers say it also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. Share: FULL STORY A lack of sleep doesn't just leave you cranky and spoiling for a fight. Researchers at The Ohio State University Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research say it also puts you at risk for stress-related inflammation. This type of inflammation is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and other diseases. \"We know sleep problems are also linked with inflammation and many of the same chronic illnesses. So we were interested to see how sleep related to inflammation among married couples, and whether one partner's sleep affected the other's inflammation,\" said <mark>Stephanie Wilson</mark>, lead researcher on the study. Results of the study were published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology. The research team recruited 43 couples who completed two study visits. Each time, the couples provided blood samples and said how many hours they had slept the previous two nights. Then researchers had the couples try to resolve a topic that sparks conflict in their marriage. Blood samples were taken again following the discussion. \"We found that people who slept less in the past few nights didn't wake up with higher inflammation, but they had a greater inflammatory response to the conflict. So that tells us less sleep increased vulnerability to a stressor,\" <mark>Wilson</mark> said. If both partners got less than seven hours of sleep the previous two nights, the couple was more likely to argue or become hostile. For every hour of sleep lost, the researchers noted that levels of two known inflammatory markers rose 6 percent. Couples who used unhealthy tactics in their disagreement had an even greater inflammatory response--about a 10 percent increase with each hour of less sleep. \"Any increase isn't good, but a protracted increase that isn't being addressed is where it can become a problem,\" <mark>Wilson</mark> said. \"What's concerning is both a lack of sleep and marital conflict are common in daily life. About half of our study couples had slept less than the recommended seven hours in recent nights .\" That's higher than the current national average. The CDC reports 35 percent of Americans get less than seven hours of sleep per night. \"Part of the issue in a marriage is that sleep patterns often track together. If one person is restless, or has chronic problems, that can impact the other's sleep. If these problems persist over time, you can get this nasty reverberation within the couple,\" said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, senior author and director of the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research. Researchers were encouraged to see that there was a protective effect if one of the partners was well-rested, or discussed conflict in a healthy way. They tended to neutralize the disagreement that might be stirred by the sleep-deprived partner. \"We would tell people that it's important to find good ways to process the relationship and resolve conflict--and get some sleep,\" Kiecolt-Glaser said.
