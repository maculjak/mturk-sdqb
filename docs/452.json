Duration | time}} SAN ANTONIO--The NBA is paying tribute to the wife of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. Erin Popovich died Wednesday at 67, the team said. Her death came after a long illness, the San Antonio Express-News reported. LeBron James, who was playing Game 2 of Cleveland's first-round series against Indiana, was visibly upset when told after the game. \"Obviously, I'm a huge Pop fan. I love Pop. That's such a tragedy,\" James said during his postgame interview on TNT. \"My best wishes go out to Pop and his family. That's devastating news .\" The NBA family, we all stick together. I know we compete every night. But something like this happens, it puts everything in perspective. \"Popovich is the current Olympic men's basketball coach. James calls him a\" mastermind of the game \"and has said he'd consider playing for the U.S. team under Popovich at the 2020 Tokyo Games after skipping the Rio Olympics. Popovich has coached San Antonio since 1996, leading the Spurs to five NBA titles. San Antonio trails Golden State 2-0 in their first-round playoff series. The 69-year-old Popovich ran practice Wednesday, but there was no immediate word on his status for Game 3 on Thursday night. Assistant coach Ettore Messina likely would lead the team if Popovich were to miss it. When told of Erin Popovich's death, Golden State's Kevin Durant said from San Antonio:\" Seriously? Man. Prayers and condolences go out to his family. \"The Popovichs have two daughters and two grandchildren. They met at the Air Force Academy in the 1970s when he was an assistant coach for the Falcons. Erin's father, Jim Conboy, was Air Force's head athletic trainer. Spurs general manager RC Buford called Erin Popovich a\" strong, wonderful, kind, intelligent woman who provided love, support and humour to all of us. \"Former Spurs assistant and current Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said he has known her a long time .\" Their family is wonderful, \"he said .\" Their family has been incredibly kind to my family. And she was a star, like a real star. A very strong woman, and somebody that will be missed. \"<mark>Bill Russell</mark>, <mark>Magic Johnson</mark> and Kobe Bryant were among those expressing condolences on Twitter. <mark>Steve Nash</mark> wrote on Twitter,\" Knowing Pop, it's fair to assume Erin Popovich was an absolute legend. My deepest sympathies to Pop and his daughters. \"", "articleID": "2018041915_00325982_W", "names": {"Steve Nash": ["Q16137022", "Q192955", "Q42316961"]}}, {"date": "2018-04-22", "url": "http://www.goupstate.com/news/20180421/charlie-boone-who-led-spartanburg-hostpital-for-30-years-dies-at-90", "content": "Charlie Boone, who led Spartanburg hostpital for 30 years, dies at 90 Saturday Apr 21, 2018 at 8:23 PM Apr 21, 2018 at 8:25 PM Chris Lavender Staff Writer @ LavenderSHJ Former Spartanburg General Hospital President and CEO Charlie Boone, a beloved leader who guided the local hospital through medical and technological advancements over three decades, died Saturday at Spartanburg Regional Hospice Home. He was 90. Boone led the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System from 1965 to 1995. Before coming to Spartanburg, Boone served as the chief operating officer for Duke University Medical Center. He also helped build the first hospital in Barnwell when he was 25. After leaving the Spartanburg Regional, Boone remained active in the community and kept an office at Spartanburg Medical Center where he would continue to visit, eating in the cafeteria and socializing with hospital staff. Mark Aycock, Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System executive vice president and chief operating officer, said he visited with Boone on Monday. The pair talked about all that's been accomplished in the healthcare system over the past few decades. While Aycock didn't work for Boone when he was CEO, the two did find time in recent years to get to know one another. \"We would talk about Duke basketball and current events,\" Aycock said. He said Boone was a source of wisdom who rarely offered unsolicited advice. Boone will be missed, he said. In November, an honorary sign was unveiled for Boone on a street near the hospital campus that connects Aimee Street to North Church Street. The Charles C. Boone Drive sign still stands in his honor. Boone received numerous awards in his lifetime, including the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Wofford College Alumni Association in 1980 and Citizen of the Year from the Spartanburg Kiwanis Club in 1982. <mark>Bill James</mark> was the healthcare system's chief of staff in 1994 and worked directly with Boone at the time. <mark>James</mark> serves as a member of the Spartanburg Regional board of trustees. Boone helped broaden the healthcare system's service, paving the way for it to expand into Cherokee and Union counties and parts of North Carolina, <mark>James</mark> said. \"People enjoyed working with Charlie because they knew he was there to support them and be nurtured by him,\" he said. \"Charlie Boone was also the best at public relations. He talked to people at all levels .\" Spartanburg County Councilman David Britt said Boone was someone that could be trusted. The county worked closely with Boone as the hospital expanded. Boone oversaw construction of new buildings, including the Montgomery Tower and the medical center parking garage. He also led efforts to improve access to care for the community, starting in 1966 when Spartanburg General began accepting Medicare. \"He could get anything done,\" Britt said. \"He was always visible to everyone at the hospital and put the hospital on the path to growth .\" State Rep. Rita Allison's husband Ron served on the hospital board for 16 years during Boone's time as president and CEO. \"It's a real loss for our community,\" Allison said. \"He did a fine job for Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System .\" A service honoring Boone will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Central United Methodist Church at 233 N. Church St., Spartanburg. Visitation will be held in the church fellowship hall immediately following the service. A private graveside service will be held at a later date.", "articleID": "2018042200_00121500_W", "names": {"Bill James": ["Q18378575", "Q18687984", "Q2037014", "Q2903257", "Q4909587", "Q4909589"]}}, {"date": "2018-04-22", "url": "http://www.wahpetondailynews.com/national/sports/brewers-beat-marlins-on-walk-off-homer-by-jesus-aguilar/article_b8420a16-6773-54a6-8ca1-b93f9e3f01b7.html", "content": "Facebook Twitter Email TownNews.com Content Exchange Facebook Twitter Email Print Save MILWAUKEE--<mark>Jesus Aguilar</mark> quickly found himself in an 0-2 hole while leading off the bottom of the ninth inning. The Milwaukee Brewers first baseman eventually fouled off seven pitches, including three with a full count. On the 13th pitch of the at-bat, he broke through. <mark>Aguilar</mark> homered to right-center off Miami Marlins reliever Junichi Tazawa, sending Milwaukee to a 6-5 victory Saturday night at Miller Park. The Brewers, who have won five straight games, trailed 4-0 early before <mark>Aguilar</mark> capped the team's seventh come-from-behind victory of the season. \"I'm very happy,\" said <mark>Aguilar</mark>, who entered the game in the top of the ninth. \"He's become a force in the National League off the bench as a pinch hitter,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. Milwaukee (13-9) tied the score in the eighth when Miami left fielder Derek Dietrich misplayed Eric Sogard's two-out popup to left, allowing Travis Shaw to score from second. Eric Thames was thrown out at the plate attempting to score the go-ahead run from first. \"We certainly caught a break there,\" Counsell said. Jeremy Jeffress (2-0) pitched a scoreless inning of relief to get the win. The Marlins, who have lost six of seven, went ahead on Dietrich's solo homer off left-hander Brent Suter in the first inning. A three-run homer by former Brewers outfielder Lewis Brinson in the second extended Miami's lead to 4-0. Shaw's leadoff home run in the bottom of the second off Jose Urena got the Brewers on the scoreboard. Shaw has reached first base 11 times (six walks, four hits, including two home runs, and hit by pitch) in the first three games against the Marlins. Milwaukee scored twice in the fourth on Thames' run-scoring single and an RBI groundout by Sogard. Miami extended the lead to 5-3 in fifth when <mark>Brian Anderson</mark>'s base hit drove in Starlin Castro, who singled and advanced to second on a wild pitch. The Brewers again pulled within a run in their half of the fifth on <mark>Ryan Braun</mark>'s sacrifice fly. Suter gave up five runs and eight hits in five innings. He walked one and struck out four. \"Probably too many pitches that caught the bad part, or good part, of the plate,\" Counsell said of Suter's outing. Urena, who made his first road start of the season, gave up four runs and four hits in five innings. He walked two batters and struck out three. The Marlins (5-15) dropped their third in a row and are now 3-12 since opening the season with a four-game split against the Cubs at home. Arcia sits out Milwaukee shortstop Orlando Arcia sat out after twisting his ankle attempting to get back to first base after singling in the eighth inning of Friday night's victory. \"He just kind of jammed his ankle and had a little swelling,\" Counsell said. \"I don't think we are completely out of the woods with it, but we will give him at least today (off).\" X-rays taken Friday were negative. \"That's definitely the best-case scenario. Very good news,\" Arcia said of the negative result. \"They told me everything was good, nothing broken, nothing bad. We just have to wait until (Saturday to see) how I feel .\" Arcia fractured the same ankle in 2012 while in the minors and missed the entire season. This article originally ran on host.madison.com.

Emmanuel Macron had reportedly studied <mark>Donald Trump</mark>'s style of domineering power-grabbing handshakes, apparently prepared to avoid being outdone by his counterpart. Instead, it was President Trump who at one point in the 5-second-long handshake attempted to withdraw his hand from Macron's firm grasp. The maneuver marked the start of what has become a close partnership between the two leaders, who recently joined forces along with the United Kingdom to strike Syria earlier this month. \"It's no secret that President Trump and President Macron enjoy a good working relationship. I may say a close personal relationship,\" a senior administration official said in a briefing with reporters. President Macron has already feted Trump in grand style, inviting him to be his guest of honor at France's elaborate Bastille Day celebrations last summer. The president and first lady dined with Macron and his wife at the Eiffel Tower and sat side-by-side as French military tanks, planes and troops rolled down the Champs-Elysee in the elaborate military parade. The event so inspired Trump that he has since called on the Pentagon to look into organizing a military parade in the United States. That parade is now set to take place on Veterans Day. By extending an invitation to host Macron for a state visit in the United States, Trump is in many ways returning the favor and celebrating the deeply-rooted historical ties between the two countries and marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. This will be the president and first lady's first time hosting a foreign leader to the full ceremonial honors of a state visit and sends a symbolic message about the value Trump places on his close ties with the French president. \"This will be a visit of symbolism of the strength and history of the U.S.-French relationship,\" says Heather A. Conley, senior vice president for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It will be more symbolism than substance .\" The events When Macron arrives in Washington on Monday for a three-day visit, he and his wife will stay at Blair House, the presidential guest house, and will dine privately with the president and first lady at George Washington's Mount Vernon home and pay a visit to the first president's tomb. \"President Trump is eager to host the Macrons for this special event, as he remembers fondly the dinner the couples shared together in the Eiffel tower on the eve of Bastille day last July,\" a senior administration official said. President Trump will officially welcome Macron to the White House on Tuesday with an elaborate welcome ceremony on its South Lawn, complete with honor guards and marching bands. They are scheduled to engage in bilateral meetings and partake in a joint news conference. Macron will also dine with Vice President Mike Pence at the State Department for a luncheon that is traditionally hosted by the Secretary of State, and visit the tomb of the unknown soldier. The day will conclude with a formal white-tie state dinner that has been in the works for several months at the personal direction of First Lady Melania Trump. Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush, said the dinner will be a chance for the first lady to showcase her skills as a hostess. McBride predicted that Melania Trump has put a keen interest in creating an elegant evening. \"Mrs. Trump wants her guests to have a wonderful, sensory experience. The flowers and lighting in the room. She pays great attention to detail. It's really a chance for her to show how they entertain,\" McBride said. The White House is closely guarding the invite list, with plans to only release the names of the invitees after the final guest has arrived for the evening, which is sure to include both French and American dignitaries. But the guest list is one of the most important and trickiest matters to navigate--to strike the right balance and set the desired tone. Several offices and departments are involved in the process, with recommendations flowing in from the State Department, the Office of Public Liaison--which largely manages the White House's relationship with outside groups--and the offices of Cabinet Affairs and legislative affairs, McBride said. But the most important suggestions of all, she added, are those that come from the first couple. \"The most important list of all is who the first family wants to have there,\" said McBride. As for what's on the menu, the White House has yet to reveal what will be served but says the first lady has personally selected and taste-tested the dishes. While some modern state dinners have been hosted in a large event tent on the South Lawn of the White House, Tuesday's dinner will be in its State Dining Room. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, says the setting is a \"nod to tradition and the historic relationship between the two countries .\" She added that there has been an effort on the part of the first lady's office \"to keep things elegant and more traditional than perhaps some of the last few state dinners .\" The live musical accompaniment for the evening will be \"classical and traditional,\" says Grisham. She suggested the entertainment will be a departure from the modern artists who made a splash at some of former President Obama's state dinners, which included live performances from A-list artists like Gwen Stefani and Beyonce Knowles. On Wednesday, Macron will deliver an address to a joint session of Congress, which Elys\u00e9e Palace says will be a \"very important moment\" of Macron's visit. \"The French president will introduce himself to the American people, will send a message of friendship, of respect and affection toward the American nation,\" the Elys\u00e9e Palace says. \"Our common history is incredible, a history of friendship that started 250 years ago. The central message that we will see at the Congress will be: Do you want to continue to write history together?\" Macron will also make a public address at George Washington University, and hold his own news conference at the conclusion of his U.S. visit. The Issues Amid all the pomp and circumstance of the ceremonial visit, there will also be the work of high-level diplomacy between the two leaders and their delegations. Macron has described his relationship with Trump as \"extremely direct and frank,\" telling the BBC in January: \"Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail .\" Macron appeared to test the limits of that frankness when he seemed to take credit recently for convincing President Trump not to pull U.S. troops out of Syria in the immediate future; Trump had said days before that the U.S. mission in Syria was nearly complete and that troops would be coming home \"very soon .\" \"We convinced him that it was necessary to stay there long-term,\" Macron said during an extended televised interview on Sunday. The White House then came out to refute Macron's assertion. \"The U.S. mission has not changed--the President has been clear that he wants U.S. forces to come home as quickly as possible,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. And Macron himself also sought to walk back the comments, later attempting to clarify: \"I did not say that either the U.S. or France will remain militarily engaged in the long term in Syria .\" After the joint strike earlier this month and the public fissure around Macron's comments on the duration of a U.S. military commitment, one issue to watch will be whether the two countries come to any sort of shared understanding around next steps for war-torn Syria. A senior administration official said the leaders would \"discuss probably in some detail the way forward on Syria\" but said it's \"difficult to say right now\" how far those discussions will go. \"The question around Syria would be,\" Now what?' \"says Conley .\" President Macron very much wants to see a diplomatic process come through. He wants more U.S. engagement...[and] wants to talk to President Trump about what the U.S. policy towards Syria will be at the same moment where President Trump has publicly announced that his desire is to remove U.S. forces from Syria. \"Conley added that it will be interesting to see how the\" leaders comment publicly on their two positions on Syria and a diplomatic process moving forward. \"While the Elys\u00e9e Palace has made clear they don't have high expectations for producing substantive agreements, the French delegation will try their hand at the art of persuasion in presenting the French position on issues of disagreement, namely the Iran nuclear deal, trade, and the Paris Climate Accord .\" We hope that this State visit will be useful and allow us to present our arguments, to convince and move forward. But on these three topics, we do not expect to obtain results, make deals [or] agreements during the visit. For example, on the Iran deal, we know that President Trump has not made a decision yet. We do not think there will be a diplomatic breakthrough during the State visit, \"the Elys\u00e9e Palace said. A senior administration official said the Iran nuclear deal is sure to be a\" a major topic of discussion \"during the meetings but said that any decisions as it relates to the United States' continuing participation in the agreement would come in mid-May, when the president faces a deadline on whether to continue to keep the U.S. a party to the deal. Even as both U.S. and French officials say there's no expectation that a final decision will be reached on the Iran deal during the visit, Conley says Macron is uniquely suited among European leaders to make potential headway with Trump as he seeks to convince him not to withdraw the United States from the pact .\" This visit will be dubbed the \"Save the Iran Nuclear Agreement' trip,\" Conley said. \"The French have historically been the toughest EU of the three--that's U.K., France, and Germany--on being tough on Iran, getting the toughest compliance possible. So in some ways, President Macron is the best to provide the president with...the toughness that he wants about and towards Iran, but trying to do so in a way that preserves the Iran nuclear agreement .\" But as it relates to the Paris Climate Accord--the historic pact on climate change to which President Obama had previously committed the United States and has since been adopted by every other country in the world--the Elys\u00e9e Palace says President Macron will refrain from trying to convince President Trump to get back on board with the agreement. \"We are not trying to get the United States back into the Paris Accord,\" the Elys\u00e9e Palace said. \"What we are doing is describing the consequences of climate change. We continue scientific and economic cooperation with the U.S.. This goes beyond the U.S. Federal state; working with American cities, NGOs, companies.

The rally followed a meeting where policy makers mentioned the need to boost domestic demand for the first time since 2015, and dropped a reference to deleveraging. Government bonds, which had been rallying at the fastest pace since 2008, declined. It's a change for China's equity investors, where virtually nothing worked only days ago. A $1 trillion rout had left banks and other onshore giants flirting with a bear market, while foreign-listed tech was having its worst start to a year since 2013, and previously profitable Wall Street strategies tracking the cheapest stocks or biggest dividend payers had all but unraveled. Even small caps, which enjoyed a brief moment in the sun in March, had resumed a multiyear rout. \"The Politburo meeting sends a signal that China may roll out fiscal stimulus and supportive monetary policies to resolve financial risk and stabilize markets,\" said <mark>Ken Chen</mark>, a Shanghai-based analyst with KGI Securities Co. \"That has boosted sentiment on the market, especially for blue chips .\" Bulls returned in full force Tuesday, at one point sending the FTSE China A50 Index toward its biggest daily gain since 2016. All industry groups on the broader CSI 300 Index rose, with property developers and banks leading gains. Even tech rebounded from a two-day slump. Firms tied to materials advanced as strength in cement companies outweighed declines for aluminum makers. While the rally helped patch some of the damage inflicted on Chinese stocks this year, the country's benchmarks are still among the world's worst performers since their January peaks. For Bocom International Holdings Co.'s Hao Hong, onshore equities are still going through a volatile period, with valuations, a slowing economy and limited inflation pressure tipping the balance in favor of bonds. \"The general trend for the stock market is down,\" he said. \"If you were buying Chinese banks for their dividend yield, then you might as well buy Chinese government bonds .\" The gap between dividend yields and bond yields has been watched by investors after the Shanghai Composite Index's best start to a year in a decade made stocks pricey relative to government debt. That spread widened again Tuesday. Hints from the Politburo meeting suggest policy makers are well aware of what's been causing market jitters. A trade spat with the U.S. has added another layer of uncertainty to an economy already grappling with the effects of the government's goal to curb leverage and reduce risk in the financial sector. The shift in tone is \"a sign that China is paying attention to the downward pressure in the economy,\" <mark>Han Wang</mark>, chief macro analyst at Industrial Securities Co., wrote in a note Tuesday. \"This would cushion part of investors' worries about the economy due to trade concern and would boost the risk appetite of the market .\" --With assistance by Amanda <mark>Wang</mark>, and Jeanny Yu Quotes from this Article", "articleID": "2018042406_00182298_W", "names": {"Han Wang": ["Q40418557", "Q42932186", "Q45464785", "Q45532219", "Q45548312", "Q45705530", "Q56027720", "Q57629190"], "Ken Chen": ["Q22774027", "Q6387439"]}}, {"date": "2018-04-24", "url": "http://en.canoe.ca/news/world/parkland-kid-questioned-by-school-officials-officers-for-shooting-ar-15-at-gun-range", "content": "PARKLAND, Fla.--A Marjory Stoneman Douglas student alleges he was aggressively questioned by school administrators and local law enforcement after posting on social media that he fired an assault weapon at a gun range with his dad. Junior Kyle Kashuv said he was brought in for questioning Monday by a school security officer and a Broward County deputy in what he says was an attempt to intimidate him. It was great learning about our inalienable right of #2A and how to properly use a gun. This was my first time ever touching a gun and it made me appreciate the #Constitution even more. My instructor was very informative; I learnt a lot. #2A is important and we need 2 preserve 2A pic.twitter.com/4rcOZbpl88--Kyle Kashuv (@ KyleKashuv) April 21, 2018 \"I can now check off being wrongfully questioned by law enforcement off my bucket list,\" tweeted Kashuv, adding \"school will be interesting for the remainder of my tenure at MSD. I am not looking forward to it .\" On Tuesday, Kashuv told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the meeting with officials was an interrogation. \"It was a clear attempt to intimidate me, and they used very, very, very harsh intimidation tactics,\" Kashuv said. After first being questioned by a school security officer, a Broward County deputy entered the room and sat behind the teen, Kashuv said. The deputy began asking Kashuv who the rifle belonged to and who he went shooting with. Kashuv said he asked if he could record the interview and was told that he couldn't. The teen said he felt like the deputy was trying to get him to incriminate his father. Kashuv said the gun debate has become so prominent since the Valentine's Day massacre that killed 17 that he \"felt it was important to learn about the physical mechanics of it,\" Kashuv said in a text to The Associated Press. \"I made sure to post about it because I wanted to show people it's people that are the issue, not guns .\" Kashuv also tweeted \"Apparently using my constitutional rights to learn how to defend myself is wrong? Sorry, I thought this was still the United States of America .\" On Friday, Kashuv posted videos on Twitter showing him firing an AR-15 rifle at a target, saying it \"strengthened my love for 2A\" and taught him \"America is the greatest country ever, where freedom intensifies and liberty is required to be a real American .\" His posts came as thousands of students around the country walked out of school for gun reform in honour of the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting. Kashuv has been a vocal supporter of gun rights and garnered heavy support from conservative pro-gun groups. The teen has drawn criticism from the core #NeverAgain students, including Emma Gonzalez and <mark>David Hogg</mark>, who have repeatedly called for a ban on assault rifles. A Broward Sheriff's Office incident report confirmed the meeting, but didn't provide any specific response to Kashuv's claim that the deputy used interrogation techniques against him. A school security supervisor told the deputy several students had expressed concern about the social media post, even though no threats were on the video, the report said. When asked about the post, Kashuv said he had borrowed the rifle from a friend and went shooting with his father, the report said. Officials contacted Kashuv's mother, who stated she knew about the video and the trip to the gun range.
