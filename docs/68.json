[{"date": "2010-04-08", "url": "http://socialistproject.ca/bullet/337.php", "content": "socialist project \u2022 e-bulletin no. 337 april 8, 2010 the palestinian academic and cultural boycott initiative (pacbi) has issued a statement encouraging margaret atwood not to accept the <mark>dan david</mark> prize, which is based at tel aviv university (tau). the pacbi statement is reproduced below. at the same time, the palestinian students campaign for the academic boycott of israel (pscabi) issued an open letter from students in gaza urging atwood not to stand on the wrong side of history. this letter was endorsed by the university teachers' association in palestine. as the pacbi statement concludes, we at caia are also appealing to atwood's: \"sense of justice and moral consistency, we hope that, until israel fully abides by international law, you shall treat it exactly as most of the world treated racist south africa, or indeed any other state that legislates and practices apartheid: a pariah state. only then can there be a real chance for a just peace in harmony with international law and based on equal human rights for all, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or other identity considerations. we urge you to reject the prize and to refuse to participate in a ceremony presided over by the head of a state accused of war crimes and other serious violations of international law .\" the bullet presents here the pacbi statement, a call from besieged gaza, and an article on the recent move by montreal artists to join the cultural boycott of israel campaign. from apartheid israel pacbi the palestinian community of writers and intellectuals is highly disappointed by your decision to accept the <mark>dan david</mark> prize, which is based at tel aviv university (tau). your writings exhibit a sophisticated understanding of colonialism, structures of political power and oppression, yet your visit to israel comes just over one year after its bloody assault on the occupied gaza strip during which it killed and injured thousands of palestinian civilians and caused massive destruction to homes, schools, mosques, hospitals, factories, un buildings, agricultural fields and infrastructure. in this light, your acceptance of a prize administered by tel aviv university and awarded in the presence of the israeli president <mark>shimon peres</mark> can only be interpreted by palestinian civil society as complicity in whitewashing israel's crimes, colonization and system of apartheid. your vast literary portfolio will forever be attached to the draconian machine of israeli colonial and racist policy. last summer, following the assault on gaza, the israeli government announced a new effort to \"rebrand' israel in the eyes of the world as a liberal nation enjoying membership in the western club of democracies. in addition to the various forms of cultural outreach designed to highlight israel's achievements, this effort included inviting more writers and artists to israel in order to show the\" civilised' side of israel and help cover up the reality of occupation and the brutal treatment of the palestinians. your appearance in israel would lend itself to this well-oiled campaign to whitewash israel's grave violations of international law and basic human rights. above everything else, it would serve to deflect attention away from israel's three forms of oppression against the palestinian people: the legalized and institutionalized system of racial discrimination against the palestinian citizens of israel; the military occupation of the west bank, including east-jerusalem and the gaza strip; and the continuous denial of the palestinian refugees' un-sanctioned right to return to their homes and to receive just reparations. these efforts cannot disguise the dark side of the story, the 43 years of an increasingly brutal military occupation, during which israel systematically colonized palestinian land with the goal of gradually emptying it of its original inhabitants in order to use it for the benefit of jewish settlers. despite the \"peace process\" which began years ago, israel routinely violates the palestinians' most fundamental human rights with impunity, as documented by local and international human rights organisations. israel extra-judicially kills palestinian leaders and activists; keeps over 9,000 palestinians imprisoned, including numerous members of parliament; subjects all palestinians under occupation to daily humiliation, intimidation and military violence; and continues to construct and expand its colonial wall, declared illegal by the international court of justice (icj) at the hague in july 2004. tel aviv university, the institution administering this award, as other israeli academic institutions, is notorious for its deep and well documented collaboration with the israeli military and intelligence establishment, its racially exclusivist university policy toward palestinian citizens of israel, and its refusal to acknowledge its past and to commemorate the destroyed palestinian village on which grounds it was built. a comprehensive report by the palestine society at the school of oriental and african studies (soas) presents strong evidence of intensive, purposive and open institutional cooperation of tau with the israeli military establishment. tau must therefore be condemned for providing cross-departmental legal, technological and strategic support for maintaining and deepening the israeli occupation by assisting ongoing lethal assaults on the occupied palestinian territories and by defending and justifying israel's occupation policies. . these policies are implicitly and explicitly supported by tau's law faculty which appointed an israeli army colonel, pnina sharvit-baruch, to its staff recently. as the army's principal international law counsel sharvit-baruch is responsible for green-lighting the decision to target civilian infrastructure and for a \"relaxing of the rules of engagement' regarding civilians on the army's international law division. the soas report points out:\" ...(t) here is nothing unique about state institutions being implicated in the pursuit of state objectives, including security-related objectives. the tense military mobilisation of jewish-israeli society, its constant-war footing, and the closely related knowledge of circles which compose the defence research and development community in this comparatively small country, together amplify the role played by academic institutions in military affairs. tau, as the largest university in israel, is, unremarkably, at the centre of this militarization.... ultimately,...this collusion with the military amounts to the commissioning of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \"with the <mark>dan david</mark> prize allegedly aiming\" to foster universal values of...justice, democracy and progress and to promote the...humanistic achievements that advance and improve our world \"tel aviv university is only attempting to distract from its criminal record. the boycott divestment and sanctions (bds) national committee recently stated that\" palestine today has become the test of our indispensible morality and common humanity. \"in the face of decades of unrelenting oppression, palestinian civil society has called upon supporters of the struggle for freedom and justice throughout the world to take a stand and heed our call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against israel until it recognises palestinian rights and fully complies with international law. many prominent international cultural figures including <mark>john berger</mark>, ken loach, <mark>arundhati roy</mark>, roger waters, <mark>john williams</mark>, among others, have declared their support for the boycott. other renowned international artists, including sting, bono, snoop dog, jean luc goddard and joan manuel serrat have also heeded our call and cancelled their gigs or participation in festivals in israel (see in conclusion, and appealing to your sense of justice and moral consistency, we hope that, until israel fully abides by international law, you shall treat it exactly as most of the world treated racist south africa, or indeed any other state that legislates and practices apartheid: a pariah state. only then can there be a real chance for a just peace in harmony with international law and based on equal human rights for all, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or other identity considerations. we urge you to reject the prize and to refuse to participate in a ceremony presided over by the head of a state accused of war crimes and other serious violations of international law. palestinian campaign for the academic & cultural boycott of israel (pacbi) was launched in ramallah in april 2004 by a group of palestinian academics and intellectuals to join the growing international boycott movement. this statement was published on their website an open letter to margaret atwood from gaza: don't stand on the wrong side of history dear ms. atwood, we are students from gaza representing more than 10 academic institutions therein. our grandparents are refugees who were expelled from their homes in the 1948 nakba. they still have their keys locked up in their closets and will pass them on to their children, our parents. many of us have lost our fathers, some of us have lost our mothers, and some of us lost both in the last israeli aggression against civilians in gaza. others still lost a body part from the flesh-burning white phosphorous that israel used, and are now permanently physically challenged. most of us lost our homes, and are now living in tents, as israel refuses to allow basic construction materials into gaza. and most of all, we are all still living in what has come to be a festering sore on humanity's conscience - the brutal, hermetic, medieval siege that israel is perpetrating against us, the 1.5 million palestinians of the gaza strip. many of us have encountered your writing during our university studies. although your books are not available in gaza - because israel does not allow books, paper, and other stationary in - we are familiar with your leftist, feminist, overtly political writing. and most of all, we are aware of your strong stance against apartheid. you admirably supported sanctions against apartheid south africa and called for resistance against all forms of oppression. now, we have heard that you are to receive a prize this spring at tel aviv university (tau). we, the students of besieged gaza, urge you not to go. as our professors, teachers and anti-apartheid comrades used to tell us, there was no negotiation with the brutal racist regime of south africa. nor was there much communication. just one word: boycott. you must be aware that israel was a sister state to the apartheid regime before 1994. many south african anti-apartheid heroes, including nelson mandela and archbishop <mark>desmond tutu</mark>, have described israel's oppression as apartheid. some describe israeli settler-colonialism and occupation as surpassing apartheid's evil. f-16s, f-15s, f-35s, apache helicopters, merkava tanks, and white phosphorous were not used against black townships. ms. atwood, in the gaza concentration camp, students who have been awarded scholarships to universities abroad are prevented, every year, from pursuing their hard-earned opportunity for academic achievement. within the gaza strip, those seeking an education are limited by increasing poverty rates and a scarcity of fuel for transportation, both of which are direct results of israel's medieval siege. what is tau's position vis-\u00e3 - vis this form of illegal collective punishment, described by richard falk, the un special rapporteur on palestinian human rights in the occupied territories, as a\" prelude to genocide? \"not a single word of condemnation has been heard from any israeli academic institution! participating in normal relations with tel aviv university is giving tacit approval to its racially exclusive policy toward palestinian citizens of israel. we are certain you would hate to support an institution that upholds so faithfully the apartheid system of its state. tel aviv university has a long and well-documented history of collaboration with the israeli military and intelligence services. this is particularly shameful after israel's bloody military assault against the occupied gaza strip, which, according to leading international and local human rights organizations, left over 1,440 palestinians dead and 5380 injured. we are certain you would hate to support an institution that supports a military apparatus that murdered over 430 children. by accepting the prize at tel aviv university, you will be indirectly giving a slight and inadvertent nod to israel's policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide. this university has refused to commemorate the destroyed palestinian village on which it was built. that village is called sheikh muwanis, and it no longer exists as a result of israel's confiscation. its people have been expelled. let us remember the words of archbishop desmund <mark>tutu</mark>:\" if you choose to be neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. \"as such, we call upon you to say no to neutrality, no to being on the fence, no to normalization with apartheid israel, not after the blood of more than 400 children has been spilt! no to occupation, repression, settler colonialism, settlement expansion, home demolition, land expropriation and the system of discrimination against the indigenous population of palestine, and no to the formation of bantustans in the west bank and the gaza strip! just as every citizen knew that s/he had a moral responsibility to boycott apartheid in south africa after the sharpeville massacre, gaza 2009 was the world's wake-up call. all of israel's academic institutions are state-run and state-funded. to partake of any of their prizes or to accept any of their blandishments is to uphold their heinous political actions. israel has continually violated international law in defiance of the world. it is illegally occupying palestinian land. it continues its aggression against the palestinian people. israel denies palestinians all of the democratic liberties it so proudly, fictitiously flaunts. israel is an apartheid regime that denies palestinian refugees their right of return as sanctioned by un resolution 194. attending the symposium would violate the unanimously endorsed palestinian civil society call for boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (bds) against israel. this call is also directed toward international activists, artists, and academics of conscience, such as you. we are certain that you would love to be a part of the noble struggle against the apartheid, colonization and occupation that the palestinian people have been subjected to for the past 61 years, a struggle that is ongoing. ms. atwood, we consider you to be what the late edward said called an\" oppositional intellectual. \"as such, and given our veneration of your work, we would be both emotionally and psychologically wounded to see you attend the symposium. you are a great woman of words, of that we have no doubt. but we think you would agree, too, that actions speak louder than words. we all await your decision. besieged gaza the palestinian students' campaign for the academic

human fossil discoveries of all time. the bones of a race of tiny primitive people, who used stone tools to hunt pony-sized elephants and battle huge komodo dragons, were discovered on the indonesian island of flores in 2004. india's blueprints requiring 15 km of bamboo stumped the shanghai engineers who expertly build skyscrapers of glass and steel. next door to india, saudi arabia spent 146 million dollars on a giant neon-lit steel spaceship that will be torn down after six months. a futuristic city built with chinese steel, raw materials and migrant labour is rising on shanghai's marshy huangpu riverfront. china has transformed a little-known trade fair called the world expo, last held in spain in 2008, into a bigger and costlier spectacle than the beijing olympics. diplomacy with rising china has forced over 200 nations including india to spend more than ever in the expo's 158-year history for the may-october event. india's symbol in shanghai will be the world's biggest bamboo dome topped with a windmill and solar panels that can produce power. saudi arabia's dhow-shaped spaceship dwarfs it, but india is being noticed in the sea of steel. communist officials of a boomtown in east china have demanded a replica for wuxi city. \"most chinese people have never been abroad but now they can see the world in their home,\" <mark>zhao yue</mark> ting, a senior engineer of the state-owned china jingye engineering corporation building india's pavilion, told the hindustan times, quoting a shanghai government propaganda line. \"you've seen the modern buildings in my country, all same,\" he said. \"this one is different and famous in china .\" china, the first developing nation to host an expo, has made the culture and trade fair a symbol of shanghai's urban miracles. the subway network was doubled to 420 km within just one year in 2009. a 45 billion dollar facelift includes a new airport terminal and runway. seven hundred million dollars were used to spruce up shanghai's waterfront bund as a rival of the champs elysees in paris. india's rs 40 crore budget - the biggest-ever and overshot - doesn't compare to germany's 67 million-dollar, france's 68 million-dollar and australia's 76 million-dollar temporary pavilions. the us, almost last to confirm entry, scraped together 61 million dollars through fundraisers. japan has stuffed a 140 million-dollar lilac silkworm cocoon with intelligent robots. as ht toured the 5.28 km world city, pedestrians clicked photographs of a military helicopter circling low. chinese staff stepped out of an infosys bus. etiquette volunteers in green and white uniforms with detachable sleeves and legs marched on roads smelling of tar. the dome stands opposite an 18,000-seat permanent culture centre where india will host a bollywood concert in july. \"the expo impact on indian industry will be limited. but once people understand a little more about indian culture, hopefully it will help improve our unbalanced trade with china,\" said j j shrikhande, who heads the india-china business forum in shanghai. the dome is more path breaking than it looks. the engineers had to design the first-ever bamboo construction code and get the chinese to approve it before building. \"this site was marshy reclaimed land so the foundation is as deep as the dome is high,\" d r naidu, vice-president of design c, a delhi-based company that conceptualised india's pavilion, told ht. he's a veteran of expo designs, but found the china's perfectionism for global events and complex rules (the bamboo must be fire and fungus-proof) most challenging. asian rivalries play out openly with all eyes on the neighbours' progress. china's oriental red pavilion is india's largest neighbour even on this site. pakistan's lahore fort - reportedly sponsored by china - stands in china's shadow with only minarets visible from india's pavilion. bhutan pulled out. jin chuan zhu, a worker at the indian site, said the expo is a window to \"what china is today .' but only five per cent of the expected 100 million visitors will be foreigners. the city gleams of fresh paint on high-rises along main avenues. one million volunteers and 300 miss etiquettes trained in manners and military marches will man shanghai for six months. volunteers coach residents not to walk out in pyjamas for the sake of shanghai's

"content": "| world kyrgyzstan's deposed president gathers supporters, opponents threaten arrest by peter leonard, associated press teyit, kyrgyzstan - kyrgyzstan's deposed president on monday rallied supporters in his home village, testing his ability to mount resistance to the opposition forces that drove him out of the capital last week. as about 500 people gathered in a muddy field in kurmanbek bakiyev's native village of teyit, the deputy head of the self-declared interim government said in the capital that an operation to arrest bakiyev was being organized. \"just let him try. if he does, much blood will be shed,\" bakiyev told reporters who asked him about the statement by almazbek atambayev. atambayev did not give details about the arrest plans, but said \"we do not want fresh bloodshed .\" at least 81 people died in the capital last wednesday when a confrontation between police and protesters exploded into gunfire and chaos. protesters stormed government buildings and bakiyev fled to his native southern region. he has refused to step down and the rally in teyit brought an array of speakers who vowed their support and waved banners with slogans such as \"hands off the legitimate president .\" there were no uniformed police in view at the rally, and the loyalty of the country's security forces remains a significant question. the stalemate has left kyrgyzstan's near-term stability in doubt. that worries the west because a u.s. air base in kyrgyzstan is crucial in the military campaign against the taliban in afghanistan. the base is used both as the launch point for refueling flights over afghanistan and as a troop transit point. troop transit flights had been diverted for several days, but the u.s. embassy said monday those flights have returned to normal operation and that the refueling flights are continuing. u.s. assistant secretary of state <mark>robert blake</mark> is to travel to kyrgyzstan on wednesday for talks including the base status. atambayev, echoing previous statements by interim government leader roza otunbayeva, said the base's status will be discussed with the united states and \"we shall decide everything in a civilized way .\" many kyrgyz oppose the base and atambayev expressed deep ambivalence. \"this base is our common cause to provide stability in afghanistan,\" he said. but then he launched into criticism of the united states for allegedly cutting deals with bakiyev's family for contracts at the base. alleged corruption by members of the bakiyev family, including enriching themselves through fuel contracts for the base, was one of the top issues that brought out protesters last week. \"while trying to preserve the base, you lost the respect of the people,\" atambayev said of the united states. bakiyev told the associated press in an interview on sunday that he had not ordered police to fire at protesters in the capital. \"my conscience is clear,\" he said. he strongly urged the united nations to send a peacekeeping force to kyrgyzstan, arguing that the nation's police and the military are too weak to keep the unrest from spreading. \"the people of kyrgyzstan are very afraid,\" bakiyev said. \"they live in terror .\" otunbayeva, after meeting monday with european union representatives, said \"we are in a rather rigid and delicate situation: people in the street demand revenge, they are ready to go there and deal with him shortly, but we'll be cautious as far as the forceful scenario is concerned and won't allow new victims .\" in taking power thursday, the interim leaders said they controlled four of kyrgyzstan's seven regions. by saturday they claimed to have expanded their control throughout the country. the interim leadership on monday announced the dismissal of kyrgyzstan's ambassadors to the united states, germany, russia and turkey. but the ambassador to russia, raimkul attakurov, rejected the order, telling the russian state news agency ria novosti that he would leave only on bakiyev's order. kyrgyzstan's society is strongly clan-based, but there are few signs that bakiyev could muster any significant tribal support in the south to challenge the self-declared interim government. some analysts say that a hike in utility prices and massive corruption has set many southerners against bakiyev. at the polls - hungary's center-right fidesz party took a commanding lead in the first round of parliamentary elections on sunday, while jobbik, a far-right party with an anti-gypsy and extreme nationalist agenda, was a strong third just behind the governing socialists. tales of survivors, iran dominate israeli commemoration of jews who perished in holocaust tales of survivors, iran dominate israeli commemoration of jews who perished in holocaust - the

mental health crisis that has swept workplaces across canada has hit law enforcement, and it will take a police cultural transformation to reverse the tide. mark bonokoski's powerful series depicts the human face of this crisis. the struggle to survive. the gripping battle against isolation. real life sagas of courage and pain. this landmark series is really an opera penned by a master storyteller of truths both hard and joyful, setting forth the fundamental proposition that mental illness is part of the human journey - in this case, the human journey of police and policing. depression and anxiety disorders - including post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) - are being recorded among police at rates higher than the national average. among rcmp members, mental disabilities now represent nearly half of all disabilities and i project that this trend is taking hold among police organizations across canada. a number of factors are in play. one is chronic job stress driven not so much by the risks of the work that police do but by the kind of workplace they inhabit. a second - compounding the first - is the embedded frustration related to the increased complexity of basic police work. growing demands range from the court, exponential growth of paper work, and autocratic managerial styles of senior officers who are also under the bureaucratic gun. a third is the accumulative effects of years of exposure among police veterans in their pre-retirement years to the horrors of everyday life they confront - everyday. a fourth, the hardening links between things like hypertension, no sleep, chronic pain and depression and anxiety. depression increases the risk of heart attack among police officers, weakens their immune system, and destroys the capacity to concentrate and relax. a vicious circle. these are not conditions of weak character, or human weakness of any kind. these are physical conditions with psychological effects. chronic job stress is caused by chronically excessive over-production of hormones, affecting brain function, blood flow and the health of the human heart. for too long, these conditions have been perceived as \"invisible\" or \"personal\" or even faked. all of this is plain wrong. in fact, using powerful brain scans, doctors can watch just how the brain changes among soldiers suffering ptsd and concussion-type injuries. we can see ptsd as it happens. we can see depression as it happens. and there is hope for the future. the neural signs of ptsd are not permanent and can change with treatment. a cure is possible. and through research now being done by harvard and mcgill in a joint project for the us army, a cure may be on the way. that said, clinical treatments for depression and anxiety are just part of what needs to happen. fundamentally, we need psychologically-healthy workplaces for police. i see clear evidence of embedded frustration among the rank and file. tremendously tense perception of senior management. gruelling doubts that the public supports police. these sensations flow into, through, and around the workplace of police and signal a public health problem right in the heart of our police community. managing the police workplace isn't easy. but its clear, a quiet revolution of management practices is called for, and one has begun at the rcmp. a transformation process in our national police force is underway. one of the stepchildren of that is a slate of \"principles of wellbeing\" to guide the future management of the rcmp. the focus is on member and employee health, wellbeing and employee renewal. 1. management practices of the future that promote employee and family wellbeing as an everyday cultural norm. 2. fairness and transparency defining how workload is
