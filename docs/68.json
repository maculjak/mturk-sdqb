The unidentified war dead--all from the UK and Commonwealth nations--were buried side by side with full military honours near Ypres. Shots from the gun salute rang out across the quiet clearing, the same Flanders field where the men lost their lives. The poignant ceremony at Wytschaete Military Cemetery formed one of the final chapters of the Dig Hill 80 project, which discovered the remains of 110 soldiers. Father Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, chaplain to the 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, conducted the service, starting at 11am. Father Patrick O\u2019Driscoll leads a burial service at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Wytschaete Military Cemetery, near Ypres (Gareth Fuller/PA) He spoke of the symbolism of the red poppy and the need for enduring peace. He said: \"We are gathered in fellowship today before God to remember those who have made the supreme sacrifice by the giving of their lives in the service of their country .\" We remember and pray for all those who have suffered, and who still suffer, as a consequence of war. \"Finally, we pray for peace and reconciliation--especially remembering those with the responsibility for the leadership of nations--that conflict may be avoided, and peace prevail among all people .\" The service was attended by representatives of armed forces from various nations, there to pay their respects to the fallen 13 men. Two of the unknown soldiers--identified as British--were carried to the ceremony by soldiers from the Fusiliers. Union Jack flags were draped over the coffins. The remaining 11 war dead were buried in a third coffin before the service began. Father O\u2019Driscoll paid tribute to the ultimate sacrifice made by the 13 soldiers as he addressed the crowd. \"We come together today to remember and thank these men for their great sacrifice in fighting and dying together as one. Soldiers prepare to bury two coffins (Gareth Fuller/PA)\" Even though we do not know their names, we remember their humanity and courage and that even in the hell of battle they were there for each other even to death. \"So in prayer and celebration, we place these men together in this consecrated and special ground, so that they rest in peace and we learn and make sure humanity endures in its fullness .\" As we commit the remains of our brothers to the deep, grant them peace and tranquility. \"After the burial, shots from the traditional four-gun salute to the fallen echoed across the quiet clearing. The Exhortation was read out, with guests repeating the famous promise:\" We will remember them. \"Music was performed by a joint venture between British and German schoolchildren, to symbolise peace and co-operation. Pupils from Mildenhall College Academy in Bury St Edmunds and St Joseph's College, Ipswich, formed the contribution from the UK. The service came as a result of the hard work of those at the Dig Hill 80 project, who excavated Hill 80--the site of a German gun emplacement where many UK and Commonwealth soldiers fell. The project led a 1.1-hectare crowdfunded archaeological excavation, which took place at the former site of Hill 80 in Wytschaete, on land that had been allocated for future housing development. The service was held at the Wytschaete Military Cemetery (Gareth Fuller/PA) The project excavated 550 metres of trenches and 430 bomb craters, with the remains of 110 soldiers--including British, French, German and South African personnel--discovered. Dig Hill 80 was highly publicised at the time, attracting international media attention and celebrity patronage from comedian <mark>Al Murray</mark> and support from military historian Dan Snow. It has not been possible to identify the 13 unknown soldiers who were buried on Thursday, but at least two are believed to be British. Three Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstones will mark their collective final resting places, which will be cared for by the commission in perpetuity. In keeping with burial tradition, the casualties were interred together, ensuring that those who served and died together are buried and commemorated together. Hill 80 was the site of a windmill before the First World War, but became an entrenched German gun position following the capture of the village of Wytschaete in 1914. The location afforded observational advantage to the Germans as it overlooked the town of Ypres and formed part of the Messines Ridge. The site remained in German hands until the Battle of Messines in June 1917, when it was recaptured. In 1918, Hill 80 was again taken by the Germans during the Battle of the Lys, before finally returning to Allied hands in September 1918. Dig Hill 80 head archaeologist Simon Verdegem said:\" It is now about a year since the investigation into the soldiers of Hill 80 was completed. \"Thanks to massive international support from individuals and organisations, enough money was raised through crowdfunding to make a detailed excavation possible. Coffins arrive for the burial service (Gareth Fuller/PA)\" The aim was not only to excavate the trenches but also to recover the soldiers. Now, the British and German soldiers will finally be given a definitive and dignified resting place along with their comrades. I dare to believe that it gives them peace, knowing that people from all over the world have joined forces to recover their mortal remains. \"In my opinion, this can count as a symbol of peace and reconciliation .\" CWGC director general Victoria Wallace said: \"It is always moving and a real privilege to attend reburials .\" And it's a credit to the team who excavated Hill 80 that they have recovered these men at last, who will now be laid to rest with former comrades, and cared for in perpetuity by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. \"It is sad that the men cannot be identified individually, but they will never be forgotten, by their nation, or by the people of Flanders who always show such respect for our war dead .\" The German soldiers discovered on Hill 80 will be laid to rest on Friday at the German war cemetery in Langemark. 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2010112519_00023582_W", "names": {"Eddie Johnson": ["Q1179451", "Q2325791", "Q376267", "Q5336165", "Q576969",

victoria schools probe wi-fi safety health effects of wireless connections on students to be examined alex de medeiros teaches a grade 8 career/health class equiped with wi-fi laptops at gordon head school in victoria, b.c. november 19, 2010. photograph by: darren stone, victoria times-colonist health worries over the use of wi-fi in schools have spread to victoria. greater victoria trustees, who oversee nearly 20,000 students in 43 schools, are taking a closer look at concerns about wi-fi--or wireless-fidelity, the wireless link that connects laptops and other devices to the internet. most of the district's secondary and middle schools have wi-fi, as do several elementary facilities. presentations about possible health issues caused by wi-fi were first made to the board in the spring. there were more last week by a group of speakers. as a result of the most recent session, the district is forming a committee to study wi-fi usage, and is inviting trustees, district workers, members of the victoria confederation of parent advisory councils and the public to take part. district secretary-treasurer george ambeault will lead the committee, which is due to make a report next spring .\" if there's any level of concern about it, then we need to be able to at least respond to people's questions, \"board chairman tom ferris said .\" if we're going to do that, we have to educate ourselves. \"health canada says exposure to low-level electromagnetic frequency, such as that coming from wi-fi, does not pose a danger to the public. it says energy levels emitted are limited by guidelines that were set after looking at thousands of peer-reviewed studies .\" as long as the exposure is below these established limits, there is no convincing scientific evidence that this equipment is dangerous to schoolchildren or to canadians in general, \"a health canada statement says. not everyone is convinced. last summer in barrie, ont., a request was made to disconnect wi-fi in area schools after parents voiced fears that it was causing nausea and headaches in students. the board declined, saying there was no evidence indicating wi-fi caused such symptoms. in november, roots and wings montessori place in surrey banned wireless devices. citizens for safe technology is a vancouver-based group that has about a dozen active supporters in the capital region. two of them, parents tammy and rob jeske, were among the speakers who addressed the greater victoria board about wi-fi last week. the couple have two sons, aged nine and 11, in local schools. tammy jeske said there is plenty of expert opinion that indicates sources of electromagnetic frequencies such as wi-fi can pose a danger .\" i've seen it in my own children, i've seen it in myself, \"she said. like others, she said she has noticed the positive effect of removing wi-fi from her environment .\" the biggest thing for us is we weren't sleeping well. myself, it was to the point where i had to take medical leave from work because i had become so chronically fatigued. \"she said wi-fi also affected the family's immune systems and led to increased illness. last year, however, after removing wireless items from the home, her sons both earned awards for perfect school attendance, jeske said. she said members of the group are pleased that the greater victoria school district is considering the wi-fi issue .\" we think there's enough evidence to warrant precaution and to hold off on wi-fi, certainly when there's an alternative in place that's easy to use. \"jeske said the alternative is to hard-wire devices. the group is scheduled to make another presentation on wi-fi concerns to the sooke board of education on dec. 7. saanich board of education chairwoman helen parker said she expects wi-fi to be discussed in the near future. aaron gulliver, canada research chair in advanced-wireless communications at the university of victoria, said discussion of wi-fi use is a positive thing .\" here at the university, it's completely wi-fi-enabled from end-to-end on campus. we have wi-fi availability everywhere, \"he said. alex de medeiros teaches a grade 8 career/health class

Credit: Nike In the back corner of a clothing boutique in downtown Manhattan, past the bolts of denim hanging from the wall, eight tailors and one cutter are at work sewing custom jeans. Each will make just two or three pairs in a day. The shop, called 3x1 (three-by-one), has intrigued shoppers and industry insiders alike. It is known for experimenting with selvedge denim sourced from mills around the world and for playing with new designs. Fans include professional athletes such as Lebron James, <mark>Tony Parker</mark> and Victor Cruz, whose superhuman physiques are ill-served by off-the-rack denim. A fully bespoke 3x1 pair can run upward of $1,200, but there are other ways for a high-end label to gain exposure to new shoppers. On Friday, 3x1 and Nike Inc. are releasing three limited-edition selvedge denim shoe styles, putting the type of fabric on the Air Force 1 for the first time ever, after 1,500 iterations. The sneakers cost $130 and come in stonewash blue, raw indigo and black denim. It's an important moment for the small denim house. \"We've had so many Nike relationships over the years,\" said owner and denim industry veteran <mark>Scott Morrison</mark>. \"I hope that this will be the first of many things we get to do .\" Nike is under constant pressure to develop new styles, so it often collaborates with outside fashion houses and designers. Drops happen every few days in an eternal cycle of hype, long lines and sellouts. Nike delivered strong results globally last quarter, but had weak sales in North America due to a slow period at its U.S. retail partners. Using non-traditional materials is one way to stand out, but the new collaboration won't be the first denim sneaker. Adidas, Puma and Converse have all sold denim styles. Nike previously made denim skateboarding sneakers and Air Jordans in collaboration with Levi's. The relationship between Nike and 3x1 began, at least in part, like many New York relationships: thanks to forced proximity. The 3x1 store is right next door to NikeLab 21 Mercer, a high-concept shop that's frequented by celebrities and hosts regular sneaker drops. Nike Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker began visiting the neighboring shop in 2011, and <mark>Morrison</mark> often chats with Al Baik, senior creative director of men's footwear at Nike Sportswear. Baik wanted to put high-end denim on people's feet. \"It only made sense to leverage <mark>Scott</mark>'s passion and expertise to get us there,\" he said. Denim is enjoying a widespread resurgence at the moment, having mounted a comeback in the past two years after shoppers passed over the classic style in favor of leggings and yoga pants throughout the mid-2010s. <mark>Morrison</mark> was along for that whole ride: He's been in the denim business for decades, first with Paper Denim & Cloth, then Earnest Sewn, before going on to run Japanese denim company Evisu. At 3x1, the custom jeans are its standout product, but the bulk of its business is in wholesale. The label's regular jeans run for around $200 to $400 and can be found in luxury retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's and Net-a-Porter. <mark>Morrison</mark> hopes to open additional 3x1 stores in California and Europe. He declined to share revenue numbers, but said the business is now \"as close to I've ever seen to profitable .\" --Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Retail and E-commerce"}, {"articleID": "2013062306_00005794_W", "names": {"Norman Rosenthal": ["Q1702411", "Q3343773"]}, "date": "2013-06-23", "url": "http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2013/6/23/lifearts/13121425&sec=lifearts", "content": "Sunday June 23, 2013 Endlessly inventive By KATE CONNOLLY Anish Kapoor in front of his installation, Symphony For A Beloved Sun, which involves conveyor belts depositing red wax on the floor of Berlin's Martin Gropius Bau exhibition hall. One of the world's most important contemporary artists has a new exhibition in Berlin that the Germans are hoping the whole world will visit. SITTING in a Berlin gallery over a cup of tea, Anish Kapoor is clearly at home in a city that is staging one of his largest ever shows. The British-based artist, 59, says the exhibition, entitled Kapoor In Berlin, is the best show he has yet put on, which may have much to do with the fact that he feels Germany demonstrates a huge degree of respect for the arts - in stark contrast to Britain and much of the rest of the world. \"Germans have a rather healthy respect for the arts and artists,\" he says, adding that \"in Germany, it seems that the intellectual and aesthetic life are to be celebrated and are seen as part of a real and good education, whereas in Britain, traditionally - certainly since the Enlightenment (in the 17th and 18th centuries) - we've been afraid of anything intellectual, aesthetic, visual .\" One of the most highly regarded sculptors in the world, Kapoor is keeping much of the vast show, which covers more than 3,000 sqm at the Martin-Gropius-Bau exhibition hall, under wraps. But he does reveal that around half the works were created especially for the show. It was, he explains, his concerted effort to stop it from becoming a retrospective, the idea of which he is keen to resist as long as he is alive and working. \"I don't see the reason to be doing a retrospective,\" he says. \"Let somebody else do a retrospective for me. There doesn't seem any reason to dwell on what's been done. Rather, let's build on it and try and do something else. I'm trying to push my practice out there and to see,\" Can I do that? Will it go there?' \"A good half of the show is new, and that's always a risk. But that's the sort of idiot I am .\" Kapoor In Berlin is a culmination of the artist's huge body of work of the past three decades, an extravaganza of colour, shapes and textures that its British curator, <mark>Norman Rosenthal</mark>, has called an \"endlessly inventive theatre of sculpture\". As Kapoor chats before the opening, around him bustling workers in hard hats glide up and down on cranes, spray pigment on to walls, and remove plastic covers from sculptures as the show takes shape. Later, we are given a sneak preview of the works, including the centrepiece of the show. Emerging from holes in walls and a trapdoor in the floor, conveyor belts rise skywards, carrying big rectangular blocks of viscous, wine-red wax. As the wax moves up, it produces a squelching sound before falling off the end of the belt and landing with a satisfying splat on the linoleum floor. Overseen by a huge crimson sphere suspended from a metal frame, Symphony For A Beloved Sun is a new creation that fills the exhibition hall's main atrium. Along with the other structures, it reveals the potential the show has to beguile the public, something Kapoor's audience has long come to expect of him. There is everything from a deflated whale, whose maroon mass spills across three rooms; to warty, cave-like innards fashioned from synthetic resin; huge geometrically fragmented mirrors; twisted stainless steel pillars; and a gigantic, slowly rotating wax bell. There is even an old British Telecom generator. Crafted from sandstone, alabaster, Kilkenny limestone and fibreglass are also the protuberances and orifices, mountains and tomb-like structures that have become Kapoor trademarks, including the subtle bulge in the wall called When I'm Pregnant, all of which reflect the long and complex history of Britain's most celebrated sculptor in a show he says is \"private and public in a very curious, sometimes uncomfortable mix\". Exhibiting at the Martin-Gropius-Bau hall, a neo-Renaissance pile in the centre of Berlin, is both a challenge and an inspiration for Kapoor, who has had to deal not just with its complicated, decorative interior, of late-19th-century ornate pillars and mosaics but also with the history that envelops the building: the Berlin Wall and the SS headquarters (of the Nazi secret police during WWII) are literally squeezed up against it, visible from the gallery's windows; and he makes deliberate references to them in his works. \"It's a building with a curious, difficult history that is inexorably linked to the history of Berlin,\" says Kapoor. \"That's very potent. You can't make a show here without some reference to all of that. And it certainly makes a show here so much more interesting .\" Symphony For A Beloved Sun is a nod to one of Kapoor's heroes, the late German sculptor Joseph Beuys, who exhibited in the same atrium space shortly after the building's postwar restoration, in 1982. It also strongly alludes to the industrialised, bloody mass murders of the Nazi era, according to <mark>Rosenthal</mark>. German critics have been quick to make the same connection to the favourite among Kapoor's fan base, Shooting Into The Corner - which has been given a room of its own - in which a cannon fires round pellets of wax into the far corner, staining the walls a blood red. \"We're pleased to say the wax stains can be removed when smeared with margarine,\" says the Martin-Gropius-Bau's director, Gereon Sievernich, highlighting just one of the many challenges Kapoor's works are posing as he inspects a show that is still very much under construction five days ahead of its opening. Other practical headaches have included the transportation, by a convoy of lorries, of the huge pieces from Kapoor's London studio. Some had to be dismantled before they could be brought into the hall; others were heaved in on horizontal cranes after window frames had been removed. For Kapoor, the arrival of his works in the space for which they were conceived over a period of months, during which their creation dominated his life, brings with it a huge sense of achievement. \"Getting things out of the studio is great, very exciting,\" he says. \"It's only when they are in the real world that they have a life of their own .\" One of his own favourites among the new works - which he describes as a \"mad, crazy idea - is the deflated PVC whale, called Death Of A Leviathan. It takes up an entire side of the building, and reinforces Kapoor's sense of responsibility towards tackling major societal issues .\" It's a big deflated skin, like a huge dead whale, a Hobbesian reference to the state being a kind of Leviathan beast that gives its control to the individual, \"he says .\" Death Of The Leviathan may imply the kind of death or deflation of the state, this present condition we seem to be in all over the world where the individual has to take responsibility for the things that the state once took responsibility for. \"- Guardian News & Media> Kapoor In Berlin is on at the Martin-Gropius-Bau exhibition hall, Berlin, until Nov 24, 2013.

The Salaria plant has been the subject of protests for years by residents complaining of putrid smells and demanding its closure. Arson was suspected as the blaze put the plant out of operation indefinitely. It also sparked shorter-term health concerns given the huge cloud of smoke that covered the city. Smoke rises from the fire (Italian Firefighters Vigili del Fuoco/AP) While no health emergency was declared, Rome authorities urged residents to close their windows and stay indoors. Officials also recommended Romans avoid eating produce cultivated near the plant, suggesting fears of toxic residue settling in the northern part of the city. Authorities are trying to monitor the smoke cloud and to find an alternative plant for regular waste treatment and to deal with the Christmas period, when rubbish collection spikes. The Salaria facility treats about 800 tons of garbage a day--between 20% and 25% of the city total, news reports said. Rome's garbage collection and disposal system were notoriously insufficient even before the plant went out of service, and officials acknowledged the blaze had turned a festering problem into an emergency. Firefighters work to extinguish the fire (Massimo Percossi/Ansa/AP) Mayor Virginia Raggi appealed for local authorities in Lazio and other regions to lend a hand and open their depots to Rome's waste for the foreseeable future. \"All institutions are working to facilitate a solution,\" she said at a news conference that was interrupted by hecklers. Environment minister <mark>Sergio Costa</mark> said health authorities have determined that there is no immediate health emergency due to the smoke, but the situation is being monitored. He suggested foul play, noting that in recent days structural work had begun to improve the plant's functioning and capacity. \"It's perplexing that precisely at the moment that the problem was being dealt with...a fire breaks out,\" he said. 0 comments"}, {"articleID": "2019050705_00205291_W", "names": {"Ashley Graham": ["Q4805451", "Q4805452", "Q53680948"], "Sophie Turner": ["Q240573", "Q735034"]}, "date": "2019-05-07", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-gb/lifestyle/beauty/the-36-best-\u2014-and-wildest-\u2014-hair-and-makeup-looks-celebrities-wore-to-the-2019-met-gala/ss-AAB0tnj?srcref=rss", "content": "Full Screen 1/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Theo Wargo/Getty Images Each year, tons of celebrities attend the Met Gala in New York City wearing their most daring ensembles.

She also wore her hair in a curled style that sat right above the wings of her suit. 13/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Darren Criss made a case for blue eye shadow at the 2019 Met Gala. Like Billy Porter, Criss also drew a line down the center of his lips, though in red. 14/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Madelaine Petsch experimented with bangs on the red carpet.

She also donned purple eye shadow. 23/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Mike Coppola/MG19/Getty Images Hailey Steinfeld opted for a curled hairstyle with a large bow on top.

Her hair was more simple, styled in natural-looking waves. 26/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Priyanka Chopra Jonas looked like a completely different person on the red carpet. Her usually sleek hair was styled in curls, and her dark eyebrows were made an icy white. She also wore berry-colored lipstick, red eye shadow, and white eyeliner. 27/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Tessa Thompson's hair doubled as a whip. Her ponytail was covered in latex, and extended past her feet. 28/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Ciara had one of the biggest--and best--hairstyles of the night. She wore an afro that extended past her shoulders, as well as green eye shadow that matched her dress. 29/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Ezra Miller turned his face into an optical illusion. Though he carried a mask, the actor mostly walked the red carpet while showing his actual face, which was covered with seven eyes. 30/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images La La Anthony took a unique approach to her hairstyle. To match her money-themed dress, the actress walked the red carpet with coins attached to her head. 31/37 SLIDES \u00a9 Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Though Cara Delevingne's makeup was minimal, the model did add one pop of color to her face. From one cheek to the other, the model wore a neon-orange streak across her face. 32/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Lili Reinhart channeled Marie Antoinette with her bold hairstyle. She attached flowers to one side, and completed the look with pink blush and matching eye shadow. 33/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Kristen Stewart paired an orange-and-yellow beauty look with her dark ensemble. Her eyes were decorated with the same colors - Stewart wore an orange shade over her eyebrows, and white shadow directly underneath. 34/37 SLIDES \u00a9 John Shearer/Getty Images Lupita Nyong' o had one of the most eye-catching beauty looks of the night. She wore five gold combs in her hair, and sparkling eye makeup across her lids.

Both the spinners have been in incredible form in the ongoing South Afric series but for Dhawan, Yadav's variation has an edge over Chahal's turn. By 8:16 AM Kuldeep Yadav has been in scintillating form in South Africa | Phoot - IANS | Indian spinners have been the force behind team's phenomenal performance in the first two games of the ongoing India South Africa ODI series. The wrist-spin duo of Yazuvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav has particularly caused a lot of problems to the South African batsmen with their pinpoint spin bowling. The wrist-spinners share 13 wickets between each other from the first two games and will aim to continue their destructive form further in the series. While the Proteas batsman who are not used to playing spin on the rough South African patches are finding it difficult to play turn, Indian batsmen play the duo in the nets every day and have accustomed themselves to the spin very well. Ahead of the third ODI in Cape Town, Shikhar Dhawan has given his verdict on who out of the two spinners is more lethal. Though both the wrist spinners have been in great form in the series, Dhawan singled out Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav as the one he finds more difficult to play. Yadav ever since rising to prominence in the IPL has been an integral part of the Indian setup in the shorter formats and has lately formed a lethal partnership with Yuzvendra Chahal. \"From my point of view, chinaman is more difficult to read. Between Kuldeep and Chahal, I think Kuldeep is a little harder to read. There are players who can't read googlies. They will find Chahal's googlies tough to handle. As far as I'm concerned, I find Kuldeep a little more difficult to read,\" said Dhawan who is himself a fantastic batsman of spin. Chahal-Yadav duo has spun magic for India on the dusty South Africa tracks which are often ruled by the pacers. While the likes of Kagiso Ranbada, Morne Morkel are failing to hit the chords for their side, Chahal and Yadav have combined well for India to see off the challenge from the Proteas batsmen. The duo bundled out South African innings in the second ODI to help India post a comprehensive victory by nine wickets. They ran through the South African top and middle order picking eight wickets between them. Chahal went on to bag his first five-for against South Africa by dismissing the likes of Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, K Zondo and <mark>Chris Morris</mark>. Meanwhile, Kuldeep packed skipper Markram and explosive batsmen <mark>David Miller</mark> along with Rabada, in the end, to stop the Proteas on a spectacularly low total of 118. Talking about the rainbow nation's problem in adapting to wrist-spin, Dhawan said, \"It's difficult to play the wrist spinners because they can turn the ball even on a flat track. Especially the overseas players...They are not used to (playing spin). So the wrist spinners can create doubts in the batsmen's mind. That's why they are effective .\" India's bowling has gone strength to strength on this tour and there was rarely a sight even in the Test series which India lost 2-1 that the Indian bowlers were not on par with the South Africans. It was most of the time their batting that failed Virat Kohli and his men. But Chahal and Kuldeep have remarkably turned things around for the Men in Blue under the able guidance of Kohli and imperative inputs of MS Dhoni from behind the wickets. They will aim to continue their brilliant run in the series when they take the field in the third ODI in Cape Town. Talking about the South African's problems of failing to tackle the spin, Dhawan ruled out the fact that they have been too impatient with the bat and instead pointed out losing wickets in the middle order as a bigger factor in the result of the first two ODIs. \"I won't say it's the lack of patience, for when you are playing the ODIs you have to score runs (quickly). They can answer it better; about their problems. But they are losing wickets in a heap in the middle-overs, which is the reason why they are not getting to their target scores. If you have doubts in your mind, then that reflects on your batting. And this is giving us the advantage,\" said Dhawan. South Africa who are already trailing behind 2-0 in the six-match series would aim to bounce back strongly in the third ODI but the team will once again be without three of their key batsmen which makes it more difficult for them. Apart from AB de Villiers and Faf Du Plessis, wicket-keeper batsman will also miss out the Cape Town ODI after picking up a wrist injury in the second game at Centurion. He is likely to be rested for 3-4 weeks and looks set to miss out on the T20 series as well."}, {"articleID": "2017092901_00231986_W", "names": {"Nelson Cruz": ["Q1133784", "Q11957344", "Q6990454"], "Felix Hernandez": ["Q1196594", "Q58310246"], "James Paxton": ["Q28054192", "Q6141080"], "Erasmo Ramirez": ["Q3055980", "Q5384933"], "Andrew Moore": ["Q17144472", "Q30597809", "Q4758056", "Q4758057", "Q4758058", "Q4758059", "Q506356"], "Nick Vincent": ["Q3339807", "Q7028082"], "Edwin Diaz": ["Q11290336", "Q5346370"], "Masahiro Tanaka": ["Q11575599", "Q11575656", "Q911463"]}, "date": "2017-09-29", "url": "http://tdn.com/sports/m-s-need-moves-to-stay-relevant/article_12e88e36-0d71-53b4-ba61-5b5fe10b5a6f.html", "content": "SEATTLE--It was four years ago when, seeking to jolt the franchise out of its extended doldrums, the Mariners shocked the baseball world by shelling out $240 million to sign second baseman Robinson Cano to a 10-year deal. Numerous club officials admitted privately at the time that such a contract made little financial sense in strict baseball terms. While Cano was then one of the game's premier players, he had just turned 31. The Mariners were hoping for four-to-five years of peak performance before age began to erode (gradually they hoped) his skills. The massive deal only made sense when linked to a franchise reset with its waning fan base and within the industry. The Mariners wanted everyone to know they were committed to winning. Signing Cano was a statement. Results to date have been mixed but generally disappointing. Cano has been an All-Star in three of his four seasons in Seattle. It's also unlikely <mark>Nelson Cruz</mark> would have signed a year later as a free agent if not for the franchise commitment shown in signing Cano. The Mariners, after perennially slogging through the season's closing weeks, played meaningful games in September in three of the last four years. They twice went to the season's final weekend before getting eliminated from postseason contention. But their postseason drought is now up to 16 years. All 29 other clubs have experienced postseason since the Mariners' magical 2001 run ended in a disappointing loss to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series. It's time for the Mariners to make another offseason splash. Texas and the Los Angeles Angels are in the process of turning over veteran rosters and have shown a willingness to spend in order to win. Oakland faces severe financial challenges but has nonetheless assembled a deep group of talented youngsters. Bottom line: The AL West already has an emerging bully in Houston, and the Mariners' three other division opponents each show signs of improvement. It's an arms race that can't be ignored. The Mariners recognize all of this, and they've taken steps over the last two seasons under general manager Jerry Dipoto to transform their roster into a younger, more athletic collection. \"Look around our diamond,\" he said. \"Our catcher (Mike Zunino) is 26. Our shortstop (Jean Segura) is 27. Our third baseman (Kyle Seager) is 29. Our outfielders (Mitch Haniger, Ben Gamel and Guillermo Heredia) are all 25 or 26 .\" We're not an old team outside of looking at <mark>Cruz</mark> and Cano. \"The pitching staff offers a similar story. While <mark>Felix Hernandez</mark> is an old 31 (in terms of mileage), the remaining rotation candidates are under 30: Mike Leake is 29, <mark>James Paxton</mark> and Ariel Miranda are 28, <mark>Erasmo Ramirez</mark> is 27, Marco Gonzales is 25 and <mark>Andrew Moore</mark> is 23. Lefty relief specialist Marc Rzepczynski is 31, and setup man <mark>Nick Vincent</mark> is 30. But closer <mark>Edwin Diaz</mark> is 23. Emilio Pagan, James Pazos and Shae Simmons are 26. Dan Altavilla is 24. Prospects Thyago Vieira and Max Povse are 23. The obvious offseason target is Japanese two-way star Shohei Otani, who is expected to be posted for MLB consideration in coming weeks by the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Pacific League. Otani is 23, which means he is subject to the international spending limits, which effectively eliminates a bidding war. The Mariners plan to make a strong push. Early indications suggest Otani will make a decision prior to the Winter Meetings. Whatever happens with Otani, the Mariners' primary offseason needs are to acquire an impact starting pitcher, a first baseman and a center fielder. They could pursue a corner outfielder if they choose to move Haniger to center. Trades are possible and have been Dipoto's preferred player-acquisition approach, but the Mariners' thin farm system makes any impact addition difficult to obtain without significantly weakening another area. The offseason roster turnover projects to free roughly $20 million in payroll once guaranteed increases for Seager and Segura are computed along with projected pay hikes for a handful of arbitration cases. Further relief is on the horizon. <mark>Cruz</mark>'s contract runs one more year at $14 million, and <mark>Hernandez</mark>'s deal runs two more years for a guaranteed $53 million. Neither is well positioned for a significant new contract. <mark>Hernandez</mark>'s form dipped significantly over the last three seasons, and while <mark>Cruz</mark> remains one of the game's premier sluggers, any new deal will start with his age-39 season. Signing an impact free agent will be costly, but big deals in recent years for <mark>Hernandez</mark>, Cano, <mark>Cruz</mark>, Seager and Segura suggest the Mariners are willing to spend money on what they view as reliable assets. So who's available on the free-agent market? The big splash for the rotation would be Yu Darvish, whom the Mariners know well from his time in Texas. Other high-impact possibilities are Jake Arrieta and <mark>Masahiro Tanaka</mark>. Signing Darvish or <mark>Tanaka</mark> could aid the Mariners in recruiting Otani, although getting either one signed--even assuming mutual interest develops--prior to Otani making a decision seems a long shot. More-likely rotation targets include Alex Cobb or Lance Lynn. The market is loaded with first basemen, including the Mariners' current duo of Yonder Alonso and Danny Valencia. The big name is Eric Hosmer, but the Yankees and Boston are expected to pursue him which, if so, could quickly escalate into a bidding war. The more likely possibilities for the Mariners are Lucas Duda or Mitch Moreland. The Mariners could choose to fill their need for a center fielder by retaining free-agent Jarrod Dyson, who could again form an effective platoon tandem with Guillermo Heredia. The best available free-agent center fielder is Dyson's old teammate in Kansas City: Lorenzo Cain, who figures to draw heavy interest. Possibilities widen if the Mariners shift Haniger to center field on a full-time or part-time basis. The top available free-agent corner outfielders are J.D. Martinez, Jay Bruce and possibly Justin Upton (if he opts out of his current contract)."}]
