final 22 points as team improves to 7-1 in true road games ron jenkins / ap unlv's tre \"von willis celebrates after hitting a three-point basket in the second half of saturday's game against tcu at daniel-meyer coliseum in fort worth, texas. notebook: competition for time bringing out the best in unlv bigs assets_url media_url story willis, stanback stay hot as unlv scorches tcu, 79-70 media_url fort worth, texas - unlv coach lon kruger admits he'd like to see some more consistent scoring threats establish themselves behind junior guard tre\" von willis and sophomore forward chace stanback. but in the meantime, boy, are those two becoming pretty fun to watch. on saturday, with tcu threatening midway through the second half, the duo combined to score 21 of the team's final 22 points, helping the rebels pull away for a 79-70 victory at daniel-meyer coliseum. willis's 30 points went in the books as a new career high, while stanback's 19 matched his career best, which was set just three days earlier at colorado state. \"defenses have to pick their poison a little bit,\" willis said. \"they've either got to focus on me or they've got to focus on chace. when they focus on me, chace steps up and knocks down shots. that's what we need. he's stepping up and playing very well right now .\" added stanback: \"when he gets the ball, i know he's gonna attack, and if he doesn't have anything, i know he's gonna look for me. we kind of feed off of each other out there .\" the two showcased their wide array of offensive abilities when things really got tense for the first time all afternoon in front of 4,270 fans in fort worth. unlv (16-4 overall, 4-2 mountain west) thoroughly controlled every aspect of the game in the first half, taking a 38-30 lead in the break. it could have easily been much larger, but tcu (10-10, 2-3) kept itself afloat by hitting a handful of timely 3-pointers. the horned frogs were just close enough that one little push could completely change things, and that happened roughly five minutes into the second half, when a quick 7-0 spurt made it a one-point game at 53-52. \"we knew we couldn't panic,\" willis said. \"we did get a little sloppy when they came back. they made that nice little run. they were at home and we knew they were going to make a run at some point. we told each other we had to take the blow, turn it on them, buckle down and finish the game .\" willis and stanback really kicked it into gear when tcu ultimately came back to tie the game at 60-60 with 8:35 left, when ronnie moss hit a layup in transition and was fouled in the process. on the heels of the old-fashioned three-point play, stanback took tcu's zvonko buljan to the rack from the left corner and dropped in a tough bucket. the next time down, he head-faked, drawing buljan into mid-air. he took a dribble and a step in, calmly cashing a 17-foot jumper. \"he's a great 16-to-18-foot shooter,\" tcu coach jim christian said. \"they ran one screen play for him that we got beat on four times that we ran through 1,000 times. maybe we should have run through it 1,004 times, i don't know .\" then it was willis's turn. on back-to-back possessions, he took advantage of a one-on-one match-up with moss. first, he backed him down off of the right wing, ultimately turning around and hitting a fading jumper off of the glass from 15 feet out. then, off of a steal, he pulled up and hit a 3-pointer in moss's face from the left wing. as he ran back down the floor, he skipped a bit, curled his lip to sneer at the crushed tcu bench and threw up three fingers on each of his hands. \"the thing i love about him from watching all the games is that he plays the game simply, and i mean that as a compliment,\" christian said. \"he understands how to catch the ball, where to catch the ball, what to do with it. he's such a hard matchup because he's got great size, he can post, he can shoot threes, he can drive the ball, he's hard to foul .\" to this point, with what i've seen, he's the best player in the league. \"that trey capped a 9-0 run put together by the pair, and in the final four minutes of the game, they simply sprinkled on some more. no other rebel scored until derrick jasper hit a free throw with 1.2 seconds left and the game already in hand. in all, willis totaled his 30 points on 9-of-14 shooting, adding six rebounds and four assists to his stat line. it was the first time in exactly two years since a unlv player reached the 30-point mark, with wink adams having last done it in a 78-71 victory over wyoming on jan. 23, 2008, with a 33-point outburst. stanback was 8-of-12 from the floor, also grabbing four defensive rebounds in 26 minutes. in reality, it was just more of the same from what is quickly emerging as the the mountain west's most deadly one-two combo on the offensive end. in six conference games, willis is averaging 24.2 points per game and is shooting 51 percent from the floor. he's scored at least 20 points now in six consecutive games. in that same stretch, stanback is averaging 14.5 points per contest on 50 percent shooting, having clearly found his groove after sitting out a year following his transfer from ucla .\" they both made big shots, played with great pace and great poise, \"kruger said .\" and we needed them all, and that's what made them more impressive. they all came at critical times, and they gave us a little bit of a cushion. \"complementing willis and stanback were the rebels' big men, who responded well across the board to a shuffle in the lineup by kruger. brice massamba started in place of <mark>matt shaw</mark> inside for the first time since dec. 12, responding with six points early in the second half. meanwhile, <mark>shaw</mark>, who turned 22 on saturday, scored 10 points off of the bench, including a pair of first half 3-pointers. darris santee, playing in his home state, scored six first half points and also grabbed two rebounds in 14 minutes of play. freshman forward nikola cerina led four horned frogs in double figures with 14 points, scoring 12 of them in the second half. the rebels joyfully left the arena and returned to las vegas after spending five days on the extended road trip having improved to 7-1 this season in true road games. they'll play league cellar dweller air force (8-10, 0-5) at at 7:30 p.m. tuesday at the thomas & mack center before an eight-day layoff. growing more and more confident on the road as the games go by, the rebels still see areas needing improvement. but for now, the league's hottest offensive

suspect this post will make some readers mad. good! respond to the post, and let's talk about it! my own parents disagree with it too. but today's world of gentle, neighborly, non-doctrinal churchmanship (sorry, churchpersonship), in which you can believe almost anything and still be considered a member in good standing of most churches, has missed a very important point: in matters of belief, souls are at stake. if we don't believe that, then we may as well pack it in. because as paul said, if the resurrection (to take one important example) hasn't happened, then we christians are of all people most to be pitied. we're just fooling ourselves. there's no logical reason we shouldn't stay home every sunday, crack open a cold one (or a case of cold ones) and enjoy ourselves in front of the tv set: why we still need heresy trials <mark>chris armstrong</mark> originally published in christianity today, summer 2003. u nited methodist bishop joseph sprague publicly denies that jesus rose bodily, that he is eternally divine, and that he is the only way to salvation. he has been charged four times with teaching heresies, and four times denominational representatives have acquitted him. this is not a lone incident. for decades before his retirement, episcopal bishop jack spong publicly repudiated nearly every line in the nicene creed and yet was never disciplined by his denomination. examples could be pulled from congregational, presbyterian, and lutheran churches. mainline leaders seem to perceive heresy as somehow an outmoded concept. or, at least, they see the heresy trial as an inappropriate venue for addressing such teachings. whatever their reasons, we are mistaken if we think modern objections to the prosecution of heretics come from sloppy thinking. to put the best face on it, such extreme leniency arises, rather, because many people are repulsed by the ways orthodox christian belief has been defended-in particular, how heretics have been prosecuted and punished. much more has been at work in historical heresy trials, george h. shriver insists in his dictionary of heresy trials in american christianity, than a simple desire to protect the faithful from bad doctrine. \"politics, jealousies, power struggles, anti-intellectualism, miscommunication, limits of knowing, grudges, personal animosities, confusion of ethics with doctrine\" have all entered into the picture, coloring not only the motivations of would-be defenders of the faith, but their actions as well. indeed. one need only think of the closed, secret trials and torture implements of the inquisition. shriver's conclusion: \"the heresy hunters have...often allowed themselves to pervert christian ethics in their pursuit of their goal of discrediting persons they have labeled\" heretics .' \"the truth of this objection to\" heresy hunting \"is only too clear from church history. but those who would use this historical evidence to attack all forms of heresy prosecution find it convenient to ignore one small fact: apart from jesus, no one has ever been exempt from mixed motives and unsavory methods. this means that the process of defining orthodox belief has always been mediated by, as historian r. scott appleby puts it in a u.s. catholic article,\" human agents who have a tendency to let their own passions, misunderstandings, and political rivalries intervene. \"so? so, read the old testament. or review the squabble between peter and paul over circumcision. the holy spirit has always found it necessary to work with the human materials at hand. and those materials have always been the same-not pretty. there was metaphorical (and sometimes real) blood on the floor of every one of the early church councils at which orthodox christian doctrine was defined and embodied in creeds. yes, it does take faith to believe that the decisions of these councils actually reflect belief as god would have it. it is the same act of faith that allows the christian to look around a church, see the assortment of annoying and downright unsavory characters occupying the pews, and affirm that the church is still, somehow, the\" body of christ. \"romancing the heretic the popular image presents the heretic as a courageous, powerless loner, exploring what fellow christians refuse to explore and paying the price at the hands of unprincipled church leaders motivated by entrenched prejudice. this holds no more water than the picture of the heretic as a black-hearted subversive and orthodox leaders as saints riding in on white horses. to take just one example, think of arius. this was the man whose teaching that jesus christ is less than fully divine (for a modern version, talk to a jehovah's witness) rocked the early church and led to the first ecumenical council. he and his followers were far from a weak, oppressed minority beset by power-hungry orthodox leaders. as tom oden puts it in his rebirth of orthodoxy, they\" lived by collusion with political oppressors. they had plenty of intellectuals and power manipulators on their side, while orthodoxy had to be defended largely by nonscholars and laypeople, by modest men and women of no means, by lowly persons who had no training or special expertise but understood their lives in christ. \"on the other hand, arius's opponent athanasius, the bold christian thinker whose leadership helped move the council of nicea to condemn arius, was no triumphant political manipulator. he was\" exiled a half-dozen times and chased all over the mediterranean world during the arian times. \"the example can be multiplied on both sides. to be sure, the inquisitorial practices of some past heresy hunts have left a permanent stain on the church-although the scale of what we might dub\" heresy abuse \"is often overblown. (contrary to popular fiction, being charged before one of the spanish inquisitions was not a guarantee of an auto-da-f\u00e9. statistical studies show that fewer than 2 percent of those charged were condemned to death .) still, we must not deny or defend travesties that did occur. at the same time, we must recognize the depth of the problem heresy trials have attempted to address. in most cases, not political but pastoral concerns have driven the church to prosecute teachers of aberrant doctrines. potent misdirection the problem is that the preached word has power-one way or the other. every sunday, unsuspecting people enter churches shepherded by those whose theological openness leads them to teach things we used to call heresies. what they hear in such teachings is not just divergent opinion. it is potent misdirection, capable of turning the sheep away from salvation. and this is the nub. as a teacher of mine once put it, if jack the ripper is abroad in your town, killing people and mutilating their bodies, the city's leaders must track him down and render him unable to inflict further harm. and if, as the historic church has always-until today-agreed, a person insists on teaching beliefs that threaten the eternal lives of all who hear them, that person must be disciplined and his harmful teaching rendered null within the church. it is easy for a comfortable\" christian \"society to demonize the mechanisms the historic church has developed to deal with heresy. but to wink at heresy is to suck the life from faith. heresies are worth fighting against, through the same kinds of mechanisms that the church has always used. yes, these mechanisms are tainted by politics and pride. but somehow still, we must believe, they have been used and will continue to be used by the holy spirit for the health of his church. in appleby's words,\" what we hold devoutly to be true, what we identify as the very core of our christian identity, has come to us through the imperfect channel of human history. \"<mark>chris armstrong</mark> is managing editor of christian history re-rooting spirituality in theology: a book worth reading: 31 minutes ago tangling with

2010 census questionnaire. \"there's a lot riding on this,\" crowley said late monday afternoon. money, that is. the u.s. census bureau conducts its population head count every 10 years. that final count, according to the bureau, will help determine how $400 billion in federal funds will be split up to cities and towns across the country. the mayor had just wrapped up a meeting in his office with barbara burgo, partnership specialist with the new bedford office of the us census bureau. also at the meeting were paula bergevin, assistant to the city's board of register of voters and daniel dermody, a taunton resident who works in the office of secretary of state <mark>william francis</mark> galvin. burgo's visit, crowley said, was a stopover on a local tour of municipalities to clear up any questions related to the questionnaire process. census questionnaires this year will be mailed out or delivered to city residents between february and march. the difference this time, compared to 2000, is that there will be just 10 questions on the form. some of those demographic questions pertain specifically to the number of residents living in any given household, one's race, ethnic origin and age and whether a housing unit is rented or owned. but no one, including illegal immigrants/undocumented aliens, will be required to explain their legal status in the country, since the census bureau cannot share an individual's responses with other federal or law enforcement agencies. the april 1 deadline is designated as census day. but for those households that did not return a questionnaire by mail, there will be census takers - from may through july - who will canvas the city in an attempt to compile a more accurate final tally. to that end it will be necessary to hire temporary, part-time workers, according to steve demello, assistant manager for recruiting in the census bureau's new bedford office. demello said that most of the hires will be \"census enumerators\" who will be paid $16 an hour plus gas expenses and other reimbursements. crew leaders, he said, will make $17.50 an hour and field operational supervisors $19 an hour. \"they try to hire local people from the neighborhood,\" demello said, adding that foreign language skills are commonly taken into consideration, depending on a neighborhood's specific demographic composition. demello said that the hiring process will extend from the end of february through april. anyone interest in applying, he said, should call 1-866-861-2010, or log on to www.2010censusjobs.gov. \"it's really just a head count,\" crowley said, but one, he added, that will have lasting, quality-of-life ramifications for the city and its populace. \"we're competing for our so-called fair share,\" he said. \"it's a

ford to new york: drop dead \"? it was october of 1975. president ford was refusing to bail out financially struggling new york city. voters were furious when the president said he'd veto any bill that aimed to help out the city with its budget woes. he suggested bankruptcy as a better option for the nation's largest city. flash forward to 2010. youngstown, ohio, a much smaller city, is also struggling mightily with its economy. so we couldn't help but recall the daily news when we saw this headline recently from the online edition of the vindicator, a newspaper based in youngstown:\" youngstown's once thriving manufacturing base has disintegrated. the city has been in an economic black hole for decades. it's hard to miss the abandoned buildings and foreclosed homes. so, when the recovery act, also known as the stimulus bill, was signed by president obama, cities like youngstown were hopeful that they'd get a big enough piece of the pie to help them through their financial troubles. as stimulus funds were distributed to states and localities throughout the year, youngstown discovered that it had been turned down on one of its requests, funding through hud's (department of housing and urban development) \"neighborhood stabilization program .\" that $2 billion program is designed to dole out money to cities so that they can rehabilitate abandoned neighborhoods. the hud denial shocked the eastern ohio community. \"it literally defies belief and explanation,\" youngstown's mayor <mark>jay williams</mark> told vindy.com. u.s. rep. <mark>tim ryan</mark>, a democrat

barack obama's 14 campaign visits to ohio in 2008, and that includes a pair of stop-overs in youngstown. mayor <mark>williams</mark> was angry too: \"there is a frustration that washington just isn't getting it .\" but we also discovered there is more here than meets the eye. while youngstown was turned down for those rehabilitation funds, it did receive stimulus funding from other sources. jared

inquirer first posted 07:11:00 01/27/2010 manila, philippines - (update 6) president gloria macapagal-arroyo's officials had repeatedly warned buluan vice mayor esmael \"toto\" mangudadatu against challenging the political bid of the ampatuans because they were a \"violent people,\" the local executive himself told the court wednesday. mangudadatu said that following his decision to run against datu unsay mayor <mark>andal ampatuan</mark> jr. for the governorship of maguindanao, he was approached by secretary gabriel claudio, presidential adviser for political affairs, then defense secretary gilbert teodoro, and former congressman prospero pichay on separate occasions. mangudadatu, who as of posting time is testifying at the resumption of the trial against ampatuan jr., said that pichay called him last november 9 to ask if he was sure about running against ampatuan jr. \"he [pichay] asked me if i was running, and i said,\" yes .' he asked me if i was sure about my decision, and i said, \"yes,'\" mangudadatu said in filipino. \"pichay warned me and told me to take care because they (the ampatuans) were a violent people,\" he said. mangudadatu said teodoro issued the same warning last october 10 when they met at a restaurant in manila. \"he [teodoro] asked me if i was running, and i said,\" yes .' he told me not to. i love you very much toto [mangudadatu's nickname]. these people are violent, \"mangudadatu quoted teodoro as telling him, referring to the ampatuans. last august 11, mangudadatu said he met with the ampatuans in malaca\u00f1ang to settle the issue .\" i was invited in malaca\u00f1ang to have dinner with the ampatuans. \"it wasn't clear, however, whether the president was there. mangudadatu said that as early as july, claudio invited him and his relatives to meet teodoro. mangudadatu said that in that meeting, also present were the ampatuans - maguindanao governor ampatuan sr., ampatuan jr., governor zaldy ampatuan of the autonomous region in muslim mindanao, sajid ampatuan, saudi ampatuan - and congressman simeon datumanong. he said that this was the first instance wherein they were asked to settle the issue. he said his brother even requested that maguindanao's chief of police, sukarno dikay, and colonel medardo geslani, head of the 601st infantry batallion, be replaced. mangudadatu said that although teodoro assured him that this would be looked into, nothing happened. mangudadatu said the repeated warning for his safety was the reason why he requested for military and police escort last november 23 when his wife, lawyers, and supporters were to file his certificate of candidacy for him in shariff aguak .\" sabi niya [referring to colonel medardo geslani] nasa maynila ang mga tao nya para sa seminar [he said his people were in manila for a seminar], \"mangudadatu said, adding that his request was also rejected by police .\" nagpasya kami na mga babae ang ipadala para maghain ng coc dahil sa islam, ang babae ay binibigyan ng malaking respeto at hindi sinasaktan, gaya sa ibang relihiyon [we decided to send women to file the coc because in islam, the women are given the greatest respect and they are not hurt, like those in other religions], \"mangudadatu said. mangudadatu recalled that on the fateful day, at around 10 a.m., his mobile phone rang. it was his wife genalyn calling .\" she told me that they have been blocked by a lot of men in the area. i asked her who they were. she said they were armed. she said that unsay was there and that he slapped her. that was the last time i heard from my wife. i called her again and my other relatives who were with her in the convoy but no one answered, \"said mangudadatu in filipino. he said he then called dicay to inform him that his wife was kidnapped. mangudadatu said dicay told him that he did not know anything. mangudadatu said that his family and ampatuan clan once had close family relations .\" i know him [<mark>andal ampatuan</mark> jr.] well for more than 10 years. our families were very close, \"mangudadatu said. he said he decided to veer away from the ampatuan after they figured in on the killing of certain datu ipao in 2008. mangudadatu said that as early as 2006, he had plans of vying for the governorship. but ampatuan sr. told him not to run and that instead, he would be given a province of his own .\" he [ampatuan sr.] asked me to produce the necessary requirements. unfortunately, we failed to meet the requirements [stated under the law for the creation of a new province], \"mangudadatu said. in 2006, upon the creation of the province of shariff kabunsuan, mangudadatu said, by law, his brother freddie, then, head of the sangguniang bayan, was supposed to sit as vice governor. but mangudadatu said <mark>andal</mark> sr. told him that he was supposed to occupy the position, not his brother. because of this, mangudadatu said <mark>andal</mark> sr. issued a resolution stating that his brother was not qualified for the position due to lack of education and experience .\" i told him, \"apo [<mark>andal</mark> sr.], my brother was able to study, three terms as board member .'\" \"i told him\" apo change what has been put in writing [referring to the resolution] because it hurts a lot,' \"mangudadatu said .\" pero wala kaming nagawa, ako, ang nanay ko, ang kapatid ko [but we weren't able to do anything, my mother, my brother]. my brother was forced to sign the resolution. \"\"bakit wala kayong nagawa [why weren't you able to do anything]?\" asked department of justice senior state prosecutor leo dacera. \"dahil napakaraming bodyguard sa compound nila [because there were a lot of bodyguards in their compound],\" he said. but in exchange for the signing of the resolution, he said they asked that they be given two municipalities, mangudadatu said, adding that armm governor ampatuan has the authority to do so. two municipalities were created where his brothers freddie mangudadatu and sajib mangudadatu sat as mayors, he said. in 2007, mangudadatu said that news reached <mark>andal</mark> sr. that he was still considering running as governor. he said the \"old man\" visited him. this time, his uncle, congressman pax mangudadatu told him not to fight the old man. \"sabi ko hindi na po [i told him, no more],\" mangudadatu said. a year later, due to the prodding of his constituents, mangudadatu said he decided to push through with his political plan. mangudadatu said that following his decision, the provincial director of maguindanao on oct. 18, 2008 confiscated the firearms of the police in his municipality, saying it was for inventory purposes only. on july 8, 2009, maguindanao chief of police dicay along with members of the 76th infantry battalion and 601st ib entered pandan municipality and disarmed the police officers. they also fired a series of shots from a 105-millimeter howitzer, causing the public to panic. mangudadatu said that when he asked dicay about what he did, the police chief told him that they were looking for umbra kato, head of the breakaway group of the moro islamic liberation front. a day later, mangudadatu said he personally met with president gloria macapagal-arroyo in guagua, pampanga and told him of his problem in his municipality. \"she immediately called general [victor] ibrado and ordered that the firearms be returned to the police and told him that the people in mangudadatu were peace loving,\" he said. mangudadatu is scheduled to return next week for his cross examination. in an earlier testimony on wednesday, mohamad sangki, a member of the sangguniang bayan of datu abdullah sangki, testified that armm governor ampatuan supported the plan to ambush the convoy of mangudadatu in november 23. sangki said he was informed by datu noradin datumanong ampatuan last november 20 that the armm governor attended a meeting with nori unas, the provincial administrator of maguindanao, ampatuan jr., and other ranking officials. \"i asked him [noradin ampatuan] about how strong our action was going to be? he said he just came from a party convention in manila. argee, nori and the old man, together with other ranking officials, they all support the old man,\" sangki said. when the prosecutor asked who nori was, sangki identified him as the provincial administrator of maguindanao. when the prosecutor asked again who argee was, sangki said it was \"zaldy,\" referring to the armm governor. and when the prosecutor asked who the \"old man was,\" sangki said, \"it was <mark>andal</mark> sr.\" sangki said that datu bahnarin ampatuan also spoke to him last november 19. \"it was the wish of the old man [ampatuan sr.] to deploy auxiliary police in maguindanao,\" sangki quoted bahnarin ampatuan as telling him. sangki said he was accompanied by the mamasapano mayor to meet ampatuan jr. and was given p15,000 for the deployment of the auxiliary police. the deployment would have been in effect until december 2, sangki said. sangki said he deployed more than 20 police auxiliary and went to crossing saniag where they met with talumbu masukat, the sangguniang bayan of mamasapano, and his men. however, during the cross examination, ampatuan's lawyer sigfried fortun tried to discredit sangki, saying that he was indicted for cases of murder in the past. fortun said sangki had been indicted in the murders of hamsa kamal, mongkika ampatuan, mawani ampatuan, and saminda sangki. fortun added that sangki also has a pending case for murder and arson. but chief state prosecutor jovencito zuno said this did not affect the credibility of the witness. \"the defense tried to discredit his credibility by presenting criminal records...but it will not damage his credibility. the direct testimony was good and even in the cross examination,\" zuno told reporters. jeofrey freddie lizada, smart telecoms legal assistant, also testified and presented a copy of a billing statement of mangudadatu's mobile phone. \"he [lizada] just testified on the authenticity of the billing statement,\" roland argabioso, national bureau of investigation (nbi) field operations chief, told the philippine daily inquirer. when asked about the importance of the phone bill, the nbi official said the call records would back the claim of mangudadatu that he spoke with his wife bai genalyn moments before she and 56 others were slaughtered. mangudadatu had maintained that his wife was able to tell him over the phone that ampatuan and a group of about 100 armed men blocked their convoy in a checkpoint in ampatuan town before the victims were massacred. argabioso said lizada's testimony only lasted about five minutes. \"the defense lawyers did not make a cross examination of the witness,\" said argabioso, who was inside the makeshift courtroom at the philippine national police in camp crame. lizada later told reporters outside the courtroom that he just presented the copy of a phone billing statement, but refused to elaborate. the hearing at the police non-commissioned officers' club building was a continuation of a petition for bail by ampatuan jr., the prime suspect in the deaths of 57 people, including 31 journalists. ampatuan arrived in camp crame at 6:30 a.m. with several escorts from the nbi and the pnp. last week, raw video footage of the massacre site was presented during the hearing. the footage showed bodies being dug from the mass graves using a backhoe. twittering me am about to wrestle people again at the mrt...damn...there goes my freshness,
