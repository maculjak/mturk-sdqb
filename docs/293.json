The paper said he had his eyes open for most of the journey by private ambulance, which was conducted like a secret service operation. <mark>Schumacher</mark> did not speak, but he communicated by nodding his head during the 200-kilometre (125-mile) journey, the paper said. The ambulance company was not told the identity of its world-famous passenger in advance, and staff had to give up their mobile phones when they came into contact with him. The paper said <mark>Schumacher</mark> had lost a lot of weight during his 170 days in hospital in the French city of Grenoble. It tracked down the Swiss ambulance company, whose head Mathias Volken confirmed its involvement, but refused to give further details. The seven-time world champion's spokeswoman Sabine Kehm on Monday thanked the doctors in Grenoble and asked for \"understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye\" . The hospital where he is now being treated is one of Switzerland's best and has renowned neurology experts.

I doubt if that's how he sees it. As he watches pictures of traffic flowing through the heart of Admiralty today, he will certainly feel relieved that he didn't lose. But he is fighting a multi-level multi-player game. He has merely survived a level. This is not to say he didn't play adroitly. By leaving the protests to burn out amidst their own divisions and the weariness of the wider Hong Kong public, he deprived the umbrella movement of the oxygen of repression and demonstrated that Beijing's tool kit for dealing with citizen defiance runs beyond tanks or truncheons. What's more, he made no concessions. The lesson that Beijing does not bow to pressure was delivered not just to Hong Kong but to the world. But the only real victory Beijing can claim in the entire episode is not in Hong Kong but at home on the mainland where, barring a few brave souls who raised their voices on behalf of Hong Kong democracy, little stirred. The main thoroughfare in Admiralty is now open to traffic, with hardly any traces of the protest camp This is an important victory for the propaganda machine, which successfully presented the protesters as a mix of spoilt children narrowly pursuing their own interests at the expense of the public good, and cunning enemies of the state in league with foreign forces. \"Any person who cares about Hong Kong and about the people of Hong Kong should say\" NO' to this hijacking of the general public will for personal objectives, \"said the Communist Party flagship newspaper, the People's Daily. Champions of democracy everywhere take note - the aspirations of the young protesters of Hong Kong did not immediately resonate with their counterparts on the mainland. Despite being beneficiaries of globalisation and despite having ever greater contact with the West through university education and holidays abroad, many young Chinese are suspicious of idealistic political messages. Since childhood, they have been exposed to a historical narrative which dwells on China's humiliation at the hands of foreigners. Many now echo their government's suspicion of street protests, social chaos and foreign ideas peddled by people whose hidden agenda may be to divide China and keep it down. According to China's best known military theorist, Sun Tzu (writing two-and-a-half thousand years ago), the best kind of victory is won without fighting. Seeing the mainland stable throughout two-and-a-half months of street protest in Hong Kong is just such a victory. But provoking thousands of citizens onto the streets in the first place is, by the same token, no kind of victory at all. Beijing brought the umbrella movement on itself. Protesters have vowed to continue with their campaign With its white paper in June and electoral arrangements in August, it made clear that it would not only draw up a narrower political board game in Hong Kong but control the pieces too. Hong Kong citizens were already resentful of the scale of mainland tourism and immigration, and the young alienated by a growing list of frustrations including impossible property prices. In this combustible mix, Beijing's announcements were the proverbial sparks that lit the prairie fire. Sun Tzu would have called this self-inflicted injury. The electoral arrangements were intended to avoid future challenges from an elected Hong Kong leader. But instead they provoked a very present challenge from at least 100,000 citizens. For a government which likes to reinforce the impression that it is in charge of not just the staging but the script, Hong Kong was an uncomfortable discovery that the props can get up and misbehave. Ever since Chairman Mao's ideological experiments resulted in the deaths of countless millions in the 1950s and 1960s, China's Communist leaders have insisted that they believe in\" seeking truth from facts \". The sobering fact in relation to the Umbrella Movement is that a generation of young people in Hong Kong is increasingly politicised and alienated from China. With their demand for democratic rights, the members of the umbrella movement effectively rebranded themselves\" not China \". Alex Chow (L) and <mark>Joshua Wong</mark> (R) are two prominent Hong Kong student leaders who have led the protests The same is true in Taiwan. Despite all of Beijing's efforts to coax the island towards reunification, the message from recent local elections as well as from the Sunflower Movement in the spring is that the Taiwanese public and especially its young people, are moving in the opposite direction. Far from assimilating easily to an increasingly wealthy China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are growing more defiant. And adding to the list of troublesome peripheries whose citizens can't be trusted to behave like true Chinese patriots, let's not forget Xinjiang. So while Xi Jinping will go on talking up his China Dream and urging the young people of China to unite behind it, he must have realised by now that his message is struggling with key audiences. Hong Kong has seen a generation of young people devote energy, passion and sacrifice into a competing dream. These are people he needs on his side. Xi Jinping may not have lost in Hong Kong, but he needs to do much, much more if he is going to win. For weeks there was a life-size cardboard cut-out of President Xi amid the tent city of the Umbrella Movement, holding aloft the obligatory yellow umbrella. It's a shame he didn't visit. 2 Minutes ago Do the Chinese close down their comment sections at six. Unless they are in advertising territory of course?\" If he (Xi) starts trying to assimilate Hong Kong into his Chinese Dream then I can imagine an even larger protest emerging \"--That should have him quaking! Hit China financially and things could change. But too many vested interests around the world will not allow that to happen. While whitey is getting rich, nothing will change...it's the way of the world. China will do what China wants, Russia will do what Russia wants, Israel will do what Israel wants.

Ron Wyden proposed legislation Friday that would give states a free hand to allow legal cannabis markets without the threat of federal criminal intervention, a move that marked the latest push in Congress to bolster the nation's burgeoning pot industry. The proposal, identical to a bill in the House, aims to ease the longstanding conflict between states where cannabis is legal in some form and the U.S. government, which categorizes marijuana as a dangerous illegal drug, similar to LSD or heroin.\" The federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong, plain and simple, \"Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.\" Too many lives have been wasted, and too many economic opportunities have been missed. \"Most Americans live in states where pot can be legally purchased for medical or recreational use, and the move to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana came as the issue has played into the emerging 2020 presidential campaign. A similar proposal previously languished in Congress. But Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat carrying the current bill in the House, said voters have\" elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in American history. \"The proposal would remove federal criminal penalties for individuals and businesses acting in compliance with state marijuana laws. It would also reduce barriers for legal marijuana businesses to get access to banking. A separate bill would impose a tax on marijuana products similar to federal excise taxes on alcohol, while another would allow state-legal marijuana businesses to claim tax deductions and credits. Justin Strekal, political director of the pro-legalization group NORML, said in a statement that the proposal is another sign of the\" growing public support for ending our failed war on cannabis consumers. \"Sign up for instant alerts from MySA by texting NEWS to 77453.

Glen Miller has been working to convert gumweed into a biofuel, which could be used as jet fuel for the military, UNR officials said in a news release on Monday. \"We are looking at breaking it down because it uses less water and it's already acclimated to Nevada conditions,\" Miller said in a statement. \"It would be beneficial generating this arid-land crop because it doesn't compete with food or animal feed.\" The primary resource for diesel fuel is soy beans and ethanol for corn which are always in direct competition with food. \"The final biofuel product could produce up to 122 gallons per acre on a biennial basis, attracting the U.S. Navy's interested in using it as jet fuel, Miller said in the news release.\" ...Gumweed is native in Nevada and grows on the side of freeways and, more importantly, is an arid land crop that requires less water than other substitutes like alfalfa, \"Miller said in the statement.\" Alfalfa takes five feet of water to grow while gumweed uses no more than a foot of water. \"Gumweed was planted at the UNR's Valley Road Field Laboratory and the Main Station Field Laboratory. After it grew and was harvested, it was broken down to a liquid that smells like tar, UNR officials said. The project received $500,000 in grant funding from the United States Department of Agriculture. It has the potential to supply up to 20 percent of fuel demand for the military, UNR officials said. Hongfei Lin is a professor of chemical and materials engineering, who is working with Miller on the project.\" It is estimated that if even 10 percent of sagebrush-covered lands in Nevada are used to grow gumweed for aviation biofuels, 400 to 600 million gallons per year of jet biofuels could be produced \", Lin, a College of Engineering collaborator, said in the news release.\" That's definitely incredible.

The Philippines made a total of seven appearances in the Summer Olympics, the first was in 1936 in Berlin, Germany and the last time in Mexico, 1968. For Cebu City Sports Commission commissioner and sportsman Lorenzo \"Chao\" Sy, Gilas' lack of experience in international competitions was one of the reasons the team fell short. \"Their performance is okay. They entertained us, they fought hard, Gilas just lack international experience. I guess everybody was satisfied with their performance especially those who bought tickets to watch the game live at MOA Arena, even our president (Rodrigo Duterte) enjoyed the game,\" Sy said. What Sy saw was the lack of shooters and the tendency of the Gilas players to play as individuals. \"They should not disband that team, just add more shooters, size and ceilings. More training and exposure abroad, maybe that's what they needed,\" said Sy. Lawyer Baldomero Estenzo, the Dean of the University of Cebu College of Law and Junemar Fajardo's legal adviser, also admitted Gilas' too much dribbling and lack of defense was the cause of their defeats. \"It's either they were not lucky on their shots or the defense of New Zealand was good that Gilas had difficulty making their shots. Also, there was too much dribbling on the part of Gilas which led to many turnovers. Gilas' defense also left much to be desired. Finally I think there was too much reliance on the MVP (Manny V. Pangilinan) players to the dismay of many. But it was the coach's call and prerogative,\" Estenzo said. For Estenzo, to become a better team, our national team should be a selection of the best players and must have a longer preparation. \"Maybe it would be better if the champion team in the All-Filipino Conference will represent the country (to international competition) with privilege to get players from the other team that it needs. (In this case) teamwork is already there. Yeng Guiao can be the coach,\" Estenzo said. Veteran coach Jun Noel of the University of San Jose-Recoletos observed that Gilas was not prepared. \"Gilas was not ready for the tournament and the new players were still adjusting to the system. That is why their defense was too loose because of the poor rotation of the players, especially the new ones,\" Noel said. UV Green Lancers head coach Gary Cortes said Gilas wasted too much time dribbling, resulting to hurried and poor shot selections. Published in the Sun. Star Cebu newspaper on July 08, 2016.
