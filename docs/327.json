Picture by Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire Andrew Woodcock, Press Association 03 September, 2018 16:20 Downing Street has delivered a stinging slapdown to former Briitsh foreign secretary Boris Johnson, saying he has produced \"no new ideas\" on Brexit. In a barely-veiled rebuff to Mr Johnson's ambitions to become prime minister, <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s official spokesman told reporters that the country needed \"serious leadership with a serious plan\" which was being provided by the current premier. The comments came after Mr Johnson used his regular Daily Telegraph column to launch a scathing attack on Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s Brexit strategy, branding it a \"fix\" that can only lead to victory for the EU. In what was seen by many at Westminster as an opening sally in a bid to oust the British prime minister, the ex-foreign secretary insisted the UK was \"lying flat on the canvas\" in withdrawal talks. Britain has \"gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank\" due to Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s Chequers proposals to align UK standards on goods to the EU, Mr Johnson said. But Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s spokesman insisted that the plans set out in the British government's Brexit White Paper were \"the only credible and negotiable plan which has been put forward\". And the spokesman added: \"Boris Johnson resigned over Chequers. There's no new ideas in this article to respond to .\" What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan. \"Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson compared withdrawal negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to a rigged wrestling match .\" The fix is in, \"said the former foreign secretary .\" The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head. \"Mr Johnson accused\" some members \"of the Briitsh government of deliberately using the Irish border question to\" stop a proper Brexit \"and effectively keep Britain in the EU. He said that the real\" scandal \"was\" not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried \"on Brexit .\" The UK has agreed to hand over \u00a3 40 billion of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat, \"he said. Under the Chequers plan,\" we will remain in the EU taxi, but this time locked in the boot, with absolutely no say on the destination \". But <mark>Theresa May</mark>'s spokesman retorted:\" The Chequers proposals are the only credible and negotiable plan which has been put forward and which will deliver on the will of the British people. \"And Home Secretary Sajid Javid said Tories should unite behind Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s blueprint, pointedly adding:\" For those who think there is a different way then they need to properly set out what alternatives there might be. \"Mr Johnson's intervention won the backing of leading Tory Brexiteers <mark>Steve Baker</mark>, who described it as\" superb \"and Owen Patterson, who said it offered a clear articulation of the\" myths \"surrounding the Irish border. It came as Mrs <mark>May</mark> faced growing opposition on Tory benches to the compromise deal agreed by the Cabinet at her country residence in July, with Brexiteers warning it will be voted down if it comes before the House of Commons. With Parliament returning from recess on Tuesday, the PM is expected to face a coordinated effort from Tory hardline Brexiteers to abandon her exit agenda amid reports that election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby is involved in a\" chuck Chequers \"campaign. And the viability of the Chequers model was also coming under question in Brussels, with Mr Barnier telling a German newspaper that he is\" strongly opposed \"to elements of the plan. Mrs <mark>May</mark>'s proposals, which would see the UK remain in a free trade area for goods while ending freedom of movement, would involve\" insane and unjustifiable bureaucracy \", said Mr Barnier. The PM's spokesman insisted that the Chequers plan had received\" a positive response \"from a number of EU leaders and said that Number 10 believes it\" can carry the support of the House of Commons \".\" We want the EU to engage in these negotiations with energy and imagination, \"said the spokesman .\" Michel Barnier has said a lot of things in recent weeks. The negotiations between the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are ongoing. You can expect some to be taking place in the coming days. \"It's very clear that the Chequers proposals are being taken seriously...What you've seen over the summer from a series of European leaders is a positive response to the Chequers proposals .\" Despite warning that the PM had declared \"open sesame\" for further concessions to Brussels, former Brexit secretary <mark>David Davis</mark> rejected suggestions she should be replaced. In what appeared to be a veiled attack on Mr Johnson - who walked out of the Cabinet hours after his own resignation over Chequers - Mr <mark>Davis</mark> told ITV1's Good Morning Britain it was not the time for \"personality politics\". Asked if it would be better if Mrs <mark>May</mark> stood down, Mr <mark>Davis</mark> said: \"No, we don't need any more turbulence right now .\" What matters in all of this is not the personality politics, it's the outcome at the end. \"Asked if he thought the Chequers deal was in tatters, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said:\" It sounds like it is and it sounds like Boris Johnson, having spent two years as Foreign Secretary, has achieved nothing and now says it's all off. \"Well surely, it's time for some serious people to take over the negotiations? The Tories have had two years since the referendum and made no progress at all .\" Enjoy reading the Irish News?

Inslee, who backed his state's ballot initiative that would have instituted the nation's first carbon tax, called on the Senate to find a way to intervene, regardless of Senate protocol.

The ranking member is expected to try to stop objectionable nominees, attempts to waive environmental laws for logging or oil drilling and perform other tasks. \"The ranking member is a backstop to extreme measures,\" said a former committee aide. \"Some of the concern would be, if no one is pushing back, then it's like there's no minority power .\" Manchin frequently sides with the GOP on the energy panel. He has backed the <mark>Trump</mark> administration, for example, in its ongoing attempts to aid the coal and nuclear power industries, despite nearly unified Democratic opposition.

But he flipped on Wednesday and voted against limiting debate on McNamee in the full Senate.

But the Finance Committee, where he is currently the top Democrat, is one of the most prestigious in the Senate, and he's given no indication that he would give up the position.

With other possibilities appearing exhausted, critics of Manchin said the best way to stop him is for Schumer to sidestep Manchin's appointment for a nonsenior candidate. Sen.

Senate Democrats take seniority seriously, and could see exceptions as a threat. Schumer's staff would not comment on the record. \"I can't think of instances where it happened. I can think of instances where people agitated for it to happen,\" said a former Democratic leadership aide. \"Everybody just feels like it won't be done,\" said another former staffer.

That relationship could work to Schumer's advantage. \"If Manchin does ascend to the ranking membership, he has to be attentive to what the Democratic leader's priorities and concerns are, and I would hope that that is actually the case,\" the former aide said. \"Not that there won't be tensions and issues that give the Republicans an opportunity to put the Democrats on the committee in a difficult position, but hopefully with communication and some leadership, they'll figure out how to navigate those situations .\" Tags Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Debbie Stabenow Martin Heinrich Charles Schumer Bernie Sanders Maria Cantwell Chuck Schumer <mark>Donald Trump</mark> Joe Manchin <mark>Bill Nelson</mark> <mark>Harry Reid</mark> Ron Wyden"}, {"articleID": "2014100313_00045035_W", "names": {"Graham Turner": ["Q21465447", "Q21557314", "Q2313039"], "Hugh O'Neill": ["Q21165090", "Q5932150", "Q5932158"], "Tom Hardy": ["Q208026", "Q21572165", "Q7816088", "Q7816089"], "John Lewis": ["Q14945660", "Q16227288", "Q18922034", "Q19565272", "Q19875174", "Q20733531", "Q20733533", "Q21462286", "Q21462293", "Q21518827", "Q28075578", "Q30611710", "Q45380", "Q51070193", "Q56597791", "Q56604623", "Q56678781", "Q58195543", "Q6244734", "Q6244736", "Q6244742", "Q6244753", "Q6244757", "Q6244759", "Q6244761", "Q6244764"]}, "date": "2014-10-03", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663841/s/3f169732/sc/13/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Ceducation0C20A140Coct0C0A30Ccatholic0Eschool0Est0Ebenedicts0Ebury0Est0Eedmunds0Ebreach0Etrojan0Ehorse0Eofsted0Erules/story01.htm", "content": "A Catholic school in Bury St Edmunds fell foul of Ofsted rules. Photograph: <mark>Graham Turner</mark> for the Guardian A Catholic state school has fallen foul of controversial rules on promoting British values and guarding against extremism and radicalisation, introduced in the wake of Birmingham's Trojan Horse affair. The Ofsted report, which followed a snap inspection but was withdrawn within hours, claimed that younger pupils at St Benedict's secondary school in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, \"show less awareness of the dangers of extremism and radicalisation\". It questioned whether the school prepared pupils \"for life and work in modern Britain\" - with the language Ofsted said on Friday morning that the report was on hold for review by its east of England regional director, Sean Harford, after St Benedict's released what appeared to be the final version of the document on its website. The report was the result of a no-notice inspection of St Benedict's by Ofsted last month, only a few days into the start of the school year, because the school website failed to include details of its citizenship teaching. Ofsted's snap inspections were introduced after the investigations in Birmingham. The inspectors recommended \"making clearer the contribution to students' preparation for life and work in modern Britain and the dangers of extremism\". The Ofsted team also complained that the school's \"delivery of citizenship education is not made clear, or how the school teaches students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation\". St Benedict's is a voluntary-aided Catholic faith secondary school with more than 600 pupils, around two-thirds of whom are Catholics. It boasts excellent A-level results, and in 2014, 70% of its pupils passed GCSEs with five or more A * - C grades, including English and maths, well above the government's minimum of 45%. <mark>Hugh O'Neill</mark>, the school's headteacher, said: \"We accept that Ofsted has a job to do, and there are reasons why they regard no-notice inspections as a valid form of inspection. We will follow whatever guidance the eventual Ofsted report that we receive asks us to follow .\" I've been gratified, as have the staff, by the number of messages we've had from colleagues, parents and students, who have all said they regard the school as excellent and don't feel the Ofsted report reflects their view of the school at all. That's been universal with everyone I've spoken to. \"The inspectors also found fault with the school's teaching and pupil progress regarding disadvantaged, disabled students - and lowered its grade from\" good \"to\" requires improvement, \"the second-lowest rating. <mark>O'Neill</mark> said Ofsted's report had come at a bad time, with parents visiting open days before making their final choices for secondary school applications this month. The school's previous inspection took place last year, and praised the pupils' moral, social and cultural development. Ofsted said that the regional director had decided to delay publication of the report\" to allow further quality assurance checks to take place \".

The biomass boiler is part of a $100 million investment in the Darlington County compound. \"A key part of Sonoco's culture is our commitment to sustainability, including our dedication to improving the environment and our contributions to the future of the communities in which we operate,\" said Sonoco President and Chief Executive Officer <mark>Jack Sanders</mark>. \"This boiler is proof of that commitment .\" \"We took more than two years to complete final engineering, fabricate the boiler, put together the infrastructure and complete construction of what we believe to be one of the nation's most state-of-the-art biomass co-generation boiler systems .\" In 2011 Sonoco committed to a $75 million investment to replace two aging, coal-fired boilers and add the new biomass boiler at its plant in Hartsville. The new boiler is fueled primarily by woody biomass from regional logging activity, but can also run on natural gas. The boiler will produce about 16 megawatts of green energy that will be consumed by the manufacturing complex, as well as steam that is used in the paper making process. \"South Carolina is being called the fastest growing economy in the Southeast,\" said Governor Nikki Haley. \"One of the reasons is because of innovative projects like Sonoco's biomass boiler. Advancements like this help businesses grow and succeed, attract new customers and bring talent and high-paying jobs to the State .\" \"This is a great day for Hartsville, my entire Senate District, the State of South Carolina and the entire reach of this Company. The investment and jobs that are created here will benefit our entire region. Sonoco, as a company and partner, has made it clear that they are committed to the present and also the future. Conservation and sustainability are the foundation of the Biomass Boiler,\" said Senator Gerald Malloy, District 29. \"This announcement marks the conclusion of an event that's taken two years to come to fruition. Two years, $100 million and countless hours. It also marks an important moment for Sonoco, one of the great stewards of our region. Sonoco is known as one of the world's top manufacturing companies, but they're much more than that. This investment is more than just dollars being put into their plant.

and she is relentless in her search for truth on stage. \"the controversy has shown itself in mcdonald's song selections for her concert, which usually include show tunes, classic songs from movies, and pieces written expressly for her. but she won't be singing hits from porgy and bess, such as\" summertime \"and\" it ain't necessarily so, \"because most of bess' songs are duets. one song that mcdonald, 41, has picked is\" go back home \"from the scottsboro boys, a musical that closed abruptly in december after playing just 49 performances following protests from people who never saw it. the john kander and fred ebb musical frames as a minstrel show the 1930s-era story of nine black teenagers wrongfully put on death row, but then immediately subverts it by having an all-black cast. some performances of the show drew protesters who refused to see it and claimed the musical was actually embracing the minstrel convention. she also plans to sing a sondheim song,\" moments in the woods \"from into the woods, after discussing it with the composer, a sign that their relationship hasn't been destroyed over porgy and bess .\" i know how passionate he is about that particular piece. that's no surprise to anybody, \"she says. the creative team, she says, has condensed the four-hour opera into a 21/2-hour musical, eliminated a lot of the repetitiveness, and tried to deepen the characters .\" for me in the end, if people are talking about theater, that's a great thing. \"the opera-turned-musical tells the story of porgy, a beggar from the slums, who tries to rescue bess from her violent lover, crown, and a drug dealer, sporting life. to play bess, mcdonald has researched drug addiction and the life of women during the 1930s in south carolina, where the writers based their work. she and paulus have talked a lot about bess' past, what gives her joy, and why she falls in love with porgy. two books also have helped: zora neale hurston's their eyes were watching god, which follows the fortunes of a black woman living in a small florida town; and the dubose heyward novel on which the opera is based and which mcdonald often consults. raised in fresno, calif., and trained at the juilliard school, mcdonald is the older of two daughters and is one of those performers who earns raves for whatever she touches. she won three tony awards before the age of 30 - for carousel, master class, and ragtime - and a fourth in 2004 for a raisin in the sun. she has two grammy awards, four albums (she's thinking of a fifth), and two emmy award nominations, and has just finished four seasons on tv playing dr. naomi bennett on the abc series private practice. she also appears in the new woody harrelson film rampart, playing a barfly with a thing for cops who has a steamy love scene with harrelson .\" it was fun to step out of my comfort zone, \"she says. the commute from new york to the set of private practice in los angeles was punishing, and mcdonald estimates that she covered 720,000 miles flying back and forth. ultimately, the long days away from her 10-year-old daughter, zoe madeline, became too much. the death of mcdonald's father in a 2007 plane crash has also put her in a reflective mood. because your contributions are currently under review, no comments can be made at this time. philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations. please treat other participants with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated. you are responsible for what you say. and please, stay on topic. if you see an objectionable post, please report it to us using the\" report abuse \"button. about your comments: these comments are monitored by philly.com staff. we reserve the right at all times to remove any information or materials that are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable. personal attacks, especially on other participants, are not permitted. we reserve the right to permanently block any user who violates these terms and conditions. according to our terms of service, you are not yet of legal age to be able to contribute to this site. thank you for registering! please note that your registration will not be considered fully complete until you confirm by following the link we have provided in a confirmation email that was just sent to 21st-century robin hood advocates higher riches for poor to help middle class yes, dozens of reversals over flawed lawyering waste time and money no, poor defendants get what they deserve"}, {"articleID": "2019012215_00360958_W", "names": {"Angus Reid": ["Q4764230", "Q4764232"]}, "date": "2019-01-22", "url": "https://ivebeenmugged.typepad.com/my_weblog/2019/01/google-eu-privacy-canada.html", "content": "Google To EU Regulators: No One Country Should Censor The Web Internationally. Poll Finds Canadians Support \"Right To Be Forgotten' Tuesday, January 22, 2019 For those watching privacy legislation in Europe, MediaPost reported:\" ...Maciej Szpunar, an advisor to the highest court in the EU, sided with Google in the fight, arguing that the right to be forgotten should only be enforceable in Europe--not the entire world. The opinion is non-binding, but seen as likely to be followed. \"For those unfamiliar, in the European Union (EU) the right to be forgotten:\" ...was created in 2014, when EU judges ruled that Google (and other search engines) must remove links to embarrassing information about Europeans at their request...The right to be forgotten doesn't exist in the United States...Google interpreted the EU's ruling as requiring removal of links to material in search engines designed for European countries but not from its worldwide search results...In 2015, French regulators rejected Google's position and ordered the company to remove material from all of its results pages. Google then asked Europe's highest court to reject that view. The company argues that no one country should be able to censor the web internationally. \"No one corporation should be able to censor the web internationally, too. Meanwhile, Radio Canada International reported:\" A new poll shows a slim majority of Canadians agree with the concept known as the \"right to be forgotten online .\" This means the right to have outdated, inaccurate, or no longer relevant information about yourself removed from search engine results. The poll by the <mark>Angus Reid</mark> Institute found 51 percent of Canadians agree that people should have the right to be forgotten...\"Consumers should have control over their information. If that control is limited to only the country of their residence, then the global nature of the internet means that control is very limited--and probably irrelevant. What are your opinions?

newsletter now daily news delivered direct to your inbox rosy future...sunderland loan star <mark>danny rose</mark>. published on monday 17 september 2012 09:20 debutant <mark>danny rose</mark> hopes his loan switch to sunderland will result in a permanent move to the stadium of light. england under-21 left-back <mark>rose</mark> made his black cats bow in saturday's 1-1 draw with liverpool after arriving on a season-long loan from spurs on transfer deadline day. the loan deal has no clause regarding a permanent transfer, and <mark>rose</mark> has not been given any indication from sunderland boss <mark>martin o'neill</mark> that he sees him as part of his long-term plans. but the doncaster-born playing is already looking to stay on wearside by impressing <mark>o'neill</mark> after seeing sunderland's ambition in the transfer market this summer. <mark>rose</mark> told the gazette: \"if there was a chance that i could move here permanently, i'd snatch it with both hands .\" nothing has been said of that kind. i'm just here on loan for the season, and anything after that would be a bonus. \"the gaffer just asked me to come here on loan and said i'd play more games here than i would at spurs, which is right .\" i've just got to take it game by game, and see where it takes me. \"i had interest from a couple of clubs, but once i saw the signings that sunderland had made, it was a no-brainer, and with being closer to my family as well, that helps .\" <mark>adam johnson</mark> has come from man city. he could have gone to a host of premier league clubs, but he came here. \"louis saha i was with last season, and they paid big money for <mark>steven fletcher</mark>. it just shows sunderland's intent for the season .\" <mark>rose</mark> underwent treatment on a groin strain at the academy of light yesterday - an injury which proved costly to sunderland's hopes of recording a first league victory of the campaign. the 22-year-old was struggling with the problem for several minutes before he was beaten by liverpool winger raheem sterling on the right-hand touchline, who crossed for <mark>luis suarez</mark> to level for the visitors. <mark>rose</mark> was honest enough to admit he was at fault for the goal, but says liverpool merited a point after piling on the pressure in the second half following <mark>fletcher</mark>'s third in two games for the black cats. \"just before the goal, i told <mark>john o'shea</mark> i was struggling with my groin,\" said <mark>rose</mark>. \"i said i'd give it five more minutes and look what happened .\" i don't think it's too bad, it just seems tight. i might have over-stretched for a ball, i don't know. \"hopefully when everything settles down with my body, we can assess it .\" he added: \"i was a bit disappointed with the goal which was my fault .\" i should have done better out wide and it's ricocheted off titus (bramble) and he's (<mark>suarez</mark>) tapped it in. \"it just shows at this level that you let your opponent get the better of you once, he puts it in the box and liverpool scored .\" liverpool did dominate if i'm honest. they play good football. \"obviously they've been a big unlucky with their results so far, but they dominated and we were happy with a point. transfer rumours: sunday september 9: man united, cristiano ronaldo, arsenal, theo walcott, chelsea, swansea, liverpool temperature:

2015 SIR <mark>TOM JONES</mark> proved there are no hard feelings between him and singer PALOMA FAITH over her new job on THE VOICE by supporting her at an intimate gig in London. The It's Not Unusual hitmaker publicly shamed BBC bosses on social media for telling him he was fired as a judge on the show only the day before they announced Faith and Boy George as replacements, despite <mark>Jones</mark> declaring an interest in returning for a fifth year. However, he proved there is no bad blood with the new coach on Wednesday night (27Aug15) by cheering Faith on at a small gig for 500 fans at The Savoy Hotel in London. Faith rattled through her hits and performed covers of Sinead O'Connor's hit single Nothing Compares 2 U, <mark>Etta James</mark>' At Last, and River Deep, Mountain High by Ike and Tina Turner. She says, \"Performing tonight was an incredible experience - from the intimate crowd to the beautiful venue. I love performing in my home city, and it's always great to be able to do something special for some of my biggest fans. It was great to be able to create a jazz club atmosphere and perform songs that I wouldn't normally, in relaxed surroundings .\" The gig was part of MasterCard's Priceless Surprises drive. Faith teamed up with MasterCard bosses earlier this year (15) to put on a concert for just two fans in an underground bank vault in London."}]
