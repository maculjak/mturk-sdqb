- state prison officials, looking for ways to stop contraband cell phones from landing in the hands of inmates, had planned thursday to take a look at the latest technology: phone jamming. but the demonstration was summarily canceled monday after texas attorney general <mark>greg abbott</mark> told them it could violate a 1934 federal law prohibiting states from interfering with federal airways. the law has been a sticking point as prison officials and lawmakers deal with an epidemic of smuggled cell phones into prison units, including death row. \"at every turn, we have attempted to identify a legal way to perform this test so that we could move forward,\" said <mark>oliver bell</mark>, chairman of the texas board of criminal justice, which oversees the prison system. \"i cannot, in good faith, violate the law in front of our nearly 38,000 employees and then demand they violate no law under threat of prosecution .\" the decision disappointed sen. john whitmire, d-houston, who received threatening calls from a death row inmate on a smuggled cell phone. those calls prompted a systemwide sweep that uncovered hundreds of the devices, including 18 on death row. other states have been struggling with the issue, and prison officials in south carolina demonstrated the jamming technology last month. \"i do question why they changed their mind,\" said whitmire. \"the federal statute should not be a roadblock. they did it in south carolina, and there were no repercussions .\" cellantenna corp. of coral springs, fla., conducted the presentation in south carolina and was scheduled to do the same in austin this week. howard melamed, ceo of the company, said he doesn't believe there were any legal issues because the company was not marketing or selling its equipment to texas. the company wanted to show technology could be safely confined to the lockup and wouldn't affect emergency calls and police radios, melamed said. he said officials from several other states had planned to attend the demonstration, which cellantenna was doing at no charge to the state. brad livingston, executive director of the criminal justice department, said the jamming technology would be a valuable tool in controlling illegal cell phones brought into prisons. the department is working with gov. rick perry, members of congress and the federal communications commission to have the law changed, he said. meanwhile, prison officials are seeking nearly $66 million for new security equipment to rid prisons of cell phones and other contraband. readers are solely responsible for the

paterson</mark>'s first state budget threatens to affect just about every new yorker. even those online. <mark>paterson</mark> proposed tuesday a 2009-10 budget that would increase spending by 1.1 percent, or $1.3 billion, to create a $121.1 billion spending plan. much of the growth is revenue from 88 new or higher fees and will hit new yorkers in many areas, from downloading music to sipping drinks to fishing. one of the proposed hikes is a so-called \"ipod tax,\" which would tax the sale of downloaded music and other \"digitally delivered entertainment services\" by 4 percent. there also would be higher taxes on gas, taxi rides, cable and satellite tv service, cigars, beer, movie and sports tickets, and health spa visits, to name a few items. <mark>paterson</mark> seems to be fighting both obesity and budget deficits with a proposal for an 18 percent tax on soda and other sugary drinks containing less than 70 percent real fruit juice. \"people don't really realize the amount of calories they're ingesting through liquids,\" said joe baker acting deputy secretary for health and human services to the governor. \"they say,\" oh, it's just a drink .' \"the idea is to discourage consumption of high-caloric beverages - health officials estimate a 5 percent drop - and to raise $404 million in fiscal year 2009-2010 toward the state's multibillion dollar budget gap. <mark>paterson</mark> said the proposal would raise $539 million in 2010-2011. the american beverage association opposes the tax, saying it would most harm the middle class. the group also argued that it doesn't make sense to single out a single food product as the cause for obesity .\" there is no science or logic that justifies it, \"the association's statement said .\" rather, we need to focus on promoting balanced eating habits and more physical activity. until we get our kids exercising more the scales will be tipped against our next generation. \"according to state officials, almost one

for higher oil prices the markets have a watery consistency to them now, and did not mix well with sinking oil prices monday. with crude once again struggling, falling $2.45 a barrel to close at $39.91, investors elected to flee rather than fight for a rally, instead letting sellers have their way in the first of an expected series of thinly traded sessions. \"once it started selling off, any buyers looking for the bounce said,\" i'll wait for tomorrow,' \"says joseph saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at themis trading. meanwhile, the price of oil continued to slump, even though the switch in contracts to february as the front-month contract on the new york mercantile exchange technically bumped oil up by more than $8 .\" the oil market is very concerning at this point, \"says mr. saluzzi .\" i would rather see a 10-point rise in oil at this point that would be good for the stock market and it would be good for global growth slowly but surely, some asset markets are responding to the litany of moves from the federal reserve. michael darda, chief economist at mkm partners, notes that the difference between three-month libor and the three-month treasury bill has declined to 1.48 percentage points, compared with 2.17 percentage points two weeks ago. the two-year swap rate has declined as well, and corporate bonds have started to respond to the massive influx of liquidity from the central bank, as the average moody's baa-rated corporate bond fell to a yield of 8.11% thursday, and was at 8.71% a week ago. more people are becoming comfortable with the idea of the fed's involvement, and \"and would note that even though the flow of news has become materially worse over the past few months, the djia is not much changed from mid-october,\" writes jeffrey saut, head of investment strategy at raymond james corp. \"basically, the major market indices have gone sideways despite the news, including news of fraud and manipulation. such pricing action suggests participants have capitulated, and that much of the\" selling' has already been done. \"some companies may be run better than others, but they can only do so much in the face of gale-force economic headwinds. shares of toyota motor lost 6% monday, and while gm continues to struggle with its own viability, toyota is facing the rough economic environment. the company said that it expects to post its first-ever operating loss in its current fiscal year, and will barely post any profits, due to the markets .\" this comes as no particular surprise amid the string of announcements detailing plans for production cuts and media previews indicating that earnings will drop into the red, \"write analysts at j.p. morgan chase. the company's losses put its value at a bit more than half of its 52-week peak, when it hit $117.59 a share .\" if there is any surprise, it lies in the seemingly unending chain reaction slide in global automobile sales and the weakness of toyota's own sales within this decline, \"analysts at j.p. morgan write. the company's outlook remains stronger than those of the detroit three, but the struggles of various auto-parts companies as a result of their decisions to defer payment on sales from the big three means could end up hurting toyota as well. among members of the dow jones industrial average, only citigroup and general motors have been worse in 2008 than alcoa, the aluminum giant, which struggles as commodity prices fall sharply. the market's late-day selloff was, in part, tied to a moody's investors service note, which suggested it might downgrade alcoa as a result of weak demand and high costs for the company. shares of the stock lost 6.2% on the day, and the stock has given up more than two-thirds of its value in the last four months. as a result of the falloff in demand, analysts at davenport & co. dropped per-share earnings estimates to $1.54 and 72 cents for 2008 and 2009, compared with $1.62 and $1.89, respectively .\" with the stock currently trading around $9.70 / sh, we continue to see attractive potential return-both short term and long term for alcoa, \"they write, cautioning that\" a higher stock price will likely only come with a rebound in aluminum prices. permalink | trackback url: wsj.com \\'s law blog focuses on law and business, and the business of law. dan slater is the lead writer .');

educators to ceos, this group caught our attention this year sat. dec 27 - 4:46 am they're not all rich. they're not necessarily powerful, in the traditional sense. their names won't be familiar to everyone, but they definitely made 2008 interesting. from development veteran ben mccrea's no-nonsense stance on his waterside property to jim wooder's push for a new container business in sydney, here are the stories of seven nova scotians who pushed forward with their dreams in 2008 and are making a difference in the province. ben mccrea founder, armour group for three decades ben mccrea has tried to keep his \"nose below the trench line\" as he built some of the most prominent buildings in halifax. the founder of armour group has always believed that projects such as historic properties, founders square and his new environmentally sensitive office building in the city of lakes business park in dartmouth can say more about the quality of the work his company does than anything he might say in an interview or news release. but in 2008 he was forced into a high-profile fight with both city politicians and a heritage lobby group when his plan to renovate buildings along the granville mall became a focal point for debate on new what kind of development is appropriate for downtown halifax. armour group owns the four heritage buildings along the mall and wants to keep their facades while unifying them under a new six-storey office tower. mr. mccrea argues it represents the only financially feasible basis on which the history represented by the buildings can be preserved. critics counter that to maintain the true heritage quality of the buildings, their interiors need to be saved. there was considerable debate and threats of lawsuits, but in october city hall gave the plan a thumbs-down. not to be deterred, mr. mccrea appealed the decision to the nova scotia utility and review board. then, as if to underscore the seriousness of the effort, he applied for demolition permits for the four buildings and pulled down an old wooden building on the property that was not to be part of the redevelopment. there is a one-year waiting period before the heritage status can be removed and the other buildings taken down, but mr. mccrea hopes it won't come to that. he believes the board will rule in january that he has followed all the rules and should be allowed to proceed with the project as originally proposed. but for mr. mccrea, 2008 was about much more than the waterside project. he was nominated by the halifax chamber of commerce as business person of the year; he was inducted into the engineering hall of fame at the university of new brunswick and his pet project with ducks unlimited, the greenwing legacy interpretive centre at shubenacadie wildlife park, was officially commissioned. his plans for another new office building in dartmouth and work on the $200-million queen's landing office building, hotel complex and revamped maritime museum of the atlantic are proceeding slowly, in part because construction costs have increased by 30 per cent since 2005 and in part because there is little financing for major projects in the current economic climate adamant that halifax has to do more to promote itself as the business centre of atlantic canada, mr. mccrea says his push for the waterside centre shows his commitment to the cause, even if it forces him into a spotlight he would rather avoid. jo ann fewer ceo, colchester regional development agency when jo ann fewer looks out across a wooded area running along highway 104 near debert, she doesn't see the starlings in the trees or the deer prints in the early december snow. the head of the colchester regional development agency sees places where roads can be built, factories can be erected, and stores and retail businesses serving a bustling industrial park can spring up. it's a vision that she's been selling for seven years, but the job of turning the idea into a reality got easier in april when the province transferred the 920-hectare debert air industrial park to colchester county and the county handed responsibility for development and marketing to her 13-member agency. \"we're going to open up lots so that industrial and commercial operators can move into large parcels of land with great highway access,\" ms. fewer says confidently. \"then we'll leverage the advantages of the debert airport for the quick movement of goods and people some of the site-clearing work has begun but more importantly, she says, the potential of the project at the intersection of the province's two most heavily travelled highways is already being recognized globally .\" we've had lots of calls over the past few years, but it was hard to turn them into anything solid until we had the land in hand. that's been accomplished, and i'm confident you'll see the first buildings going up in the spring. \"ms. fewer, the past head of the provincial association of development agencies, is also pushing for the creation of an atlantic bioscience accelerator to bring high-end agricultural jobs to the region; helping draft a transportation master plan for the area; travelling internationally to enhance efforts to attract immigrants to the area (64 have settled in the region since 2005 and 117 are in the application process); and lobbying to make sure businesses in the region will have early access to natural gas .\" she's got boundless energy and you have to run to keep up with her, \"says <mark>alan johnson</mark>, the agency's director of marketing .\" she's a strategic thinker and quick to move on opportunities, but her strength is her ability to bring people together. \"agency figures suggest the organization has injected more than $25 million into the local economy since 2001, but ms. fewer believes that once the economy begins to right itself and several of the group's other projects get traction, that number will look small. she sits on the advisory board for the eco-efficiency centre at dalhousie university and as the mother of two active boys, she spends most of her spare time with her husband at the rink or soccer field as a dedicated fan. joan mcarthur-blair president, nova scotia community college joan mcarthur-blair is a champion of community college education. the president of nova scotia community college hasn't been shy about articulating the crucial role that the community college will play in the health of nova scotia's economy and in solving the impending shortage of skilled workers. the former vice-president of education at vancouver community college came to nova scotia in 2005 to take the job as head of nova scotia community college and has shown determination in matching community college education with rapidly changing needs of industry and business. industry has more input into the design of programs and workers have more choice about how and where a program is delivered .\" a la carte education \"is what ms. mcarthur-blair calls it .\" nova scotia community college generates ideas, applied research and knowledge for its communities, \"she said this year at the opening of a new business incubation centre at the college's annapolis valley campus. the centre brings together scientists, researchers and technology entrepreneurs in the commercialization of research. ms. mcarthur-blair is also busy promoting a stronger link between the colleges and the communities where they are located. students and staff at the 13 college campuses in nova scotia have all taken on projects relating to the health, environment and improvement of the communities they call home. energy sustainability has become part of the college's curriculum. for instance, the college is recruiting students for a new two-year program, energy sustainability engineering technology, at the annapolis valley campus in middleton. the program will teach students with a trades background how to create customized energy systems that include solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, tidal and other alternative renewable sources .\" graduates will be prepared to take a leadership role in helping future employers develop more environmentally sustainable practices, \"ms. mcarthur-blair said earlier this year in a news release. the centre for the built environment, an upcoming addition to the college's new waterfront campus in dartmouth, will open in 2010 and serve about 500 students in 13 enhanced trades and technology programs. mickey macdonald entrepreneur, halifax it's all about doing the right thing, says mickey macdonald. while the halifax businessman has parlayed his business savvy into a successful career, he has also made a difference in a lot of people's lives because he believes in giving back to the community. in 2008, mr. macdonald and his brother colin were recognized with a red cross humanitarian award for their community work and support for local charities. he also received the <mark>paul harris</mark> fellowship award from the rotary club for contributions to the rotary charitable and educational programs. his investment of more than $1.5 million in palooka's boxing club on gottingen street in halifax has created a venue for young people to learn the tactics and strategy of boxing while developing character traits such as discipline, focus and building self-confidence and self-esteem .\" when you get into business, there is no real blueprint to tell you what you are supposed to do as far as your return to the community after you take money out of it, \"he said .\" i guess a lot of times you look to role models to set an example for you to give something back. \"his role models?\" my mother was a big one. she was always very giving and always telling us to give back, take care of the kids, things like that. and in business, my brother colin (ceo, clearwater fine foods), my brother-in-law john risley (co-owner, clearwater seafoods) and their commitment to giving back. other people, like charlie keating and harry steele, all these icons, successful business people, they give back to the community. \"mr. macdonald, whose diverse business interests include retail, food and beverage, fitness, automotive leasing and residential land development, says he is a bit embarrassed about receiving awards for doing what he believes is right and is humbled by it .\" \"i understand that when people are recognized, whether it is me or somebody else, it will inspire others to step up and do these things. i don't really consider myself a role model but hopefully i can make an impression on some people and say that is the right thing to do, to help out and give back. at the end of the day you have a choice,\" he said. jim wooder ceo, laurentian energy there is an air of enthusiasm and optimism for new economic development around the port of sydney these days, and jim wooder has played a big part in creating that climate. the ceo of laurentian energy at sydport has been front and centre at several major project announcements in 2008. it's been a good-news list: the announcement of a port master plan; plans to dredge the harbour channel entrance that will open the port to bigger ships; laurentian's plans with its paris investor to build a new container terminal; formation of a sydney marine group; and the announcement by laurentian to build two onshore drilling rigs for calgary firm nabors canada. \"when i first came here close to 3 1/2 years ago, i was really interested in just how many people here give of themselves and i tried to find something that will help turn the place in the right direction and on a sustainable basis,\" he said. \"i guess what we have been able to accomplish with the harbour development is we have been able to articulate a vision that can be shared by most members of the community. that is really important because if people can't see themselves in it, then they are less likely to pay attention to it and support it, and that maybe is the defining feature of the harbour work,\" he said. mr. wooder said the key to sustainable port growth is channel dredging. \"we exploded a lot of myths, and the master port plan which was launched on jan. 8 brought to people's attention the really significant issue of the dredging as the key enabling event, and we keep saying it because it is true,\" he said. at times mr. wooder was told it was \"difficult to get people pulling on the oar at the same time,\" and he said maybe he has been \"catalytic\" in changing that. \"i think the trust we have developed within the marine group has been very significant in the context of what we have achieved, because you have players who compete but have seen the rationale and the logic in sharing information and working together,\" he said. \"the fact that marine group members are actually funding, in part, the environmental assessment for the channel dredging is really terrific evidence of how far we have come .\" winning the contract to build the two rigs was also significant, mr. wooder said. \"building sustainable capacity is really where the future is here, and i think the nabors example is something this community needs to reflect on as a kind of model to attract other businesses. people do value reasonably priced, very competent labour, and labour is becoming an increasingly important commodity in the overall value chain .\" cohen macinnis president, highland group of companies cohen macinnis cannot understand what all the fuss is about. the 20-year-old created a buzz in new glasgow after acquiring and beginning renovations to the landmark maritime building, which has overlooked the community since 1915. his highland group of companies has refurbished most of the eight-storey structure and it is almost filled with new tenants. \"there is really a lot happening in pictou county, and it is really exciting to be a part of it,\" the entrepreneur said of a project many people in the community associate with a resurgence of interest in the downtown core. he just wishes people would quit making such a big fuss about his age. \"i've actually been at this for a while. i acquired my first building when i was 18,\" he said of his start in property management and development. although he is enthusiastic about the support he received in new glasgow for his renovation, he still calls antigonish home and got his start in business there. before acquiring his first property he managed a hotel and then brought an avis vehicle-rental business to the community. \"i have a supportive family but was not born into money or anything like that,\" said the soft-spoken president of highland group. \"i built the business from the ground up .\" these days mr. macinnis is involved in talks about a couple of buildings that fit his requirements. he is looking for commercial space that is underutilized and undervalued so he can bring new life and value to the property and its neighbourhood. \"the maritime building had about 30 per cent occupancy and it was not an active participant in the community. at christmas there would be lights and decorations on other the other buildings but nothing on the maritime building. that has changed,\" he said. lisa samson-boudreau manager, caper gas lisa samson-boudreau didn't just see a business opportunity in 2008; she seized it. with the retreat of big oil companies from rural cape breton, she saw there was a niche market that she could tap into by simply installing gas pumps and above-ground gas tanks at established businesses. thus caper gas, a division of arichat independent fuel oil distributor boudreau's fuels ltd., was born. caper has installed gas pumps at basque convenience on the chapel island reserve, shamrock store in d'escousse, g. h. smith and son in orangedale, fleur de lis store in l'ardoise, ehler's convenience and coffee shop in whycocomagh and seal cove restaurant and convenience in louisdale. and the company is looking for additional locations. \"it was a challenge as a small business,\" she said, suggesting that might have been a good thing. \"it's helped us look at how we do things and make necessary changes. it was not a throw-away year .\" ms. samson-boudreau also made news in 2008 as a vocal advocate of the province's gas price regulation regime. she took exception to a call by the halifax chamber of commerce to have the government drop gas regulation, wondering how many chamber members have to drive 50 kilometres to fill their tanks. chamber president valerie payn said regulation hasn't delivered stable gas prices or increased opportunities for independent gasoline retailers to make a profit, especially in rural areas. \"free-market forces, not the government, ultimately determine the price of gasoline,\" she said, adding that the administrative costs associated with regulation could be better spent elsewhere. ms. samson-boudreau disagreed, saying that gas price regulation provides guaranteed margins to operators in rural areas who don't have the high-volume sales found in urban centres. she said it offers some security and has allowed her to operate as a distributor and take up the slack the major companies left behind. \"this way people in rural areas get service and retailers can make money,\" she said.", "articleID":

haron, who attended the graduation ceremony. \"in fact, my parents were rubber tappers after their retirement and this issue is very close to my heart.i can see that it is special for you too,\" he continued. \"it was so quiet when i graduated - it felt like a funeral. all of you shout so much but it's okay. shout away .\" with their parents and relatives in tow, the throng of people exceeded the capacity of the university hall and only parents were allowed in. \"i feel very happy for my son as we are poor and simple folk,\" said a father who had come from pahang. \"i know it was hard for him to adjust to the pace of modern life in the beginning .\" having overcome the challenges, i hope he won't forget his roots and will come back to his settlement now and then to inspire others. \"launched in 2005 by deputy prime minister datuk seri najib tun <mark>abdul razak</mark>, the generasi baru programme is designed to provide the next generation of felda settlers with tertiary education at limkokwing. students received their diplomas in disciplines such as animation, broadcasting, digital photography, interior design, hair design, fashion and apparel design, graphic design, advertising, information technology, business management and tourism management. among them was faculty of communication, media and broadcasting graduate norzazrina zainuddin who hails from najib's hometown of pekan. the connection was further amplified as she was awarded the dato' sri mohd najib tun <mark>abdul razak</mark> award for creativity and innovation .\" i enjoyed my mass communication studies here as i always loved using the camera, \"norzazrina said .\" i learned a lot here and made full use of the opportunity to be part of the princeworks filming crew for three months. \"not stopping there, the brand ambassador for felda even dabbled with script writing and hopes to work with embassies eventually .'\" i plan to pursue a degree now, \"she added .\" i've always been a confident person and have built on that in my time here. i'm happy to represent the university. \"however, it wasn't all smooth sailing for norzazrina .\" my parents came here today and they were crying when i received my scroll as it has been a hard journey for all of us. they found it hard to understand and accept that my work for the media was not a nine-to-five job. sometimes, i returned home really late. i took a lot of time to explain things to them and appreciate that they love me regardless. \"as the ceremony ended and the crowd slowly eased their way out, the generasi baru graduates congregated at the stage for one last group photo.", "articleID": "2008123014_00029918_W", "names": {"Abdul Razak": ["Q247730", "Q41251943", "Q4665681"]}}, {"date": "2009-01-01", "url":

rotator cuff operations in 2005 and led the jets to the playoffs. but his work this year in guiding the miami turnaround from 1-15 to 11-5 was perhaps the best of his career. the dolphins are afc east champions. \"my experience over the last nine years is that when you're winning, you feel appreciated; when you're losing, it gets a little tough,\" he said. \"that's just part of winning and losing, especially in this league because the stakes are high - a lot of eyes watching you, both individually and as a team .\" pennington received 19 of 50 votes from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the league. that was 13 more than quarterbacks kerry collins of tennessee and jake delhomme of carolina. another quarterback, arizona's kurt warner, received four votes, as did his teammate, wide receiver anquan boldin. top defensive rookie. new england linebacker jerod mayo won the ap's award for nfl defensive rookie of the year. mayo was a nearly unanimous choice, receiving 49 of the 50 votes. mayo led the patriots with 139 tackles, according to their coaches' calculations after reviewing game tapes. he singled out veteran tedy bruschi for his guidance. \"i had heard horror stories about coming in as a rookie - guys really wouldn't help you,\" mayo said. \"i came into the patriots organization thinking the worst - that these guys weren't going to help me, and they aren't going to want me to play, but it was the exact opposite .\" the only other defensive rookie to get a vote was cincinnati bengals linebacker keith rivers. mayo was the 10th pick in the first round, one pick behind rivers. broncos. a day after firing <mark>mike shanahan</mark>, team owner pat bowlen gave no timetable for hiring the coach's replacement. bowlen said he dismissed

again but had not taken any phone calls about openings. he also was the broncos' executive vice president of football operations. former broncos quarterback john elway, a hall of famer, has been mentioned as a possible part of the management team that would replace <mark>shanahan</mark> in the front office. cowboys. dallas fired special-teams coach bruce read, making him the first assistant
