ahead of sunday's east lancashire derby at burnley after virtually guaranteeing their barclays premier league survival with victory over birmingham. <mark>david dunn</mark> - who spent three and a half years with birmingham before rejoining rovers in 2007 - netted a brace against his old club at ewood park, opening the scoring by firing past <mark>joe hart</mark> after just five minutes. <mark>james mcfadden</mark> equalised early in the second half with a fine free-kick before <mark>dunn</mark> struck again in the 67th minute, heading home el-hadji diouf's corner to seal the win. \"the victory was the most important thing and we've got that, leaving us with a very good opportunity to play our local rivals on sunday with less fear,\" the blackburn boss said. \"we can go there, relax, just try and enjoy the game as best we can and see if we can play and get a result .\" wednesday night could have been even sweeter for <mark>dunn</mark> had referee mark clattenburg not disallowed his emphatic strike just before half-time, with michel salgado adjudged to have committed a foul in the build-up. \"it was supposed to be for a foul on (lee) bowyer but if you look at it again, there has been much worse that has gone on, and i think it was a great shame when you've had a finish as good as that,\" allardyce said. \"dunny could be sat with the ball signed, with a hat-trick ball, but it doesn't really matter now because we have won the game and he has scored two. he is very happy, as all the players are .\" birmingham boss alex mcleish acknowledged <mark>dunn</mark>'s role in his team's defeat, but felt clattenburg had failed to spot two infringements that led to blackburn's second goal. \"he scored the two goals and there is no doubt that

vote-getting blocs led by the prime minister and his chief rival, a political equation that could add up to bitter political wrangling and risk reigniting violence. prime minister nouri al-maliki, a shi'ite who enjoys wide support with the shi'ite majority, is neck and neck with former prime minister ayad allawi, who is popular with iraq's sunni minority. if neither camp emerges with a clear mandate, many fear a drawn-out political debate to form a government could spill over into violence and complicate american efforts to speed up troop withdrawals in the coming months. interior minister jawad al-bolani, himself a candidate, called on iraq's electoral commission to hold off releasing the tally today because he fears the political rivalries could erupt into violence. that concern has been echoed by many members of maliki's state of law coalition, who say they fear the shi'ite majority could react in outrage if they feel the results aren't what they expect. such pronouncements are likely to reflect political posturing. election officials have dismissed calls for a further delay or a recount of the returns from the march 7 vote. many iraqis fear a return to violence between the sunni and shi'ite factions amid the horse-trading that will ramp up in earnest once all of the results are made public. maliki's coalition has drawn much of its support from the shi'ite majority, and his attempts to appeal to sunnis were undercut by his support for a ban on many sunni candidates for alleged ties to saddam hussein's regime. the sunnis largely threw their support behind allawi's iraqiya bloc, which although headed by a shi'ite, has billed itself as secular. iraq's kurdish faction sees itself as a key electoral kingmaker, though followers of radical anti-us shi'ite cleric moqtada al-sadr could also play a pivotal role after garnering a significant number of seats. \"everybody's talking to everybody,\" said <mark>michael hanna</mark>, an iraq

from toronto starter brett cecil off the area just below his left knee-cap. the third baseman, who was supposed to serve as the sox' designated hitter saturday which would mark his first back-to-back appearances of the spring, had to be helped off the field by head trainer mike reinold and manager terry francona. the red sox later classified the injury as a \"contusion,\" with francona relaying following the 3-2 sox win that preliminary tests were somewhat positive. \"he was x-rayed, negative. saying that, he took a pretty good shot,\" francona said. \"it was below the kneecap enough where it got some...it didn't just get bone. we were gonna dh him tomorrow. i don't think that's realistic. he's going to be pretty sore. he's intact. he's just going to be pretty sore .\" it looked like it

"http://boxingnews24.com/2010/03/abraham-shows-little-class-in-dirrell-bout/", "content": "by william mackay: up until saturday night, arthur abraham (31-1, 25 ko's) has always seemed like a nice guy with a gentile disposition. however, last saturday night, boxing fans got to see another side of abraham when he hit american andre dirrell (19-1, 13 kos) with a tremendous right hand while dirrell was down on the canvas after slipping. dirrell was badly hurt after getting hammered by abraham and needed to be taken to the hospital after the incident, which briefly had dirrell flat on his back, both eyes closed and legs going throw spasms. abraham was disqualified for the punch by referee lawrence cole. but instead of admitting wrong doing for punching dirrell while he was down on the canvas, an angry looking abraham said to showtime interviewer <mark>jim gray</mark>, \"he's [dirrell] a good actor .\" abraham seemed unwilling to admit what he did was wrong. it seemed shocking to see a fighter who could show no remorse after having clearly done an illegal act by hitting dirrell while he was down. later, abraham's promoter wilified sauerland said that dirrell \"deserved an oscar .\" what seems really alarming is that abraham couldn't admit wrong in what he did. never mind if he thinks that dirrell was acting, he still should have at least admitted what he did was wrong in hitting dirrell while he was helpless on the canvas. instead of blaming dirrell for what he saw as an acting job, abraham should have been gracious enough to say what he did was wrong. by not doing that and coming across an unremorseful while being interviewed after the fight, it made abraham look as if he didn't see what he did was wrong. dirrell was taken to a nearby hospital after the fight and had a brain scan conducted to see if there was any sign of a brain bleed. thankfully for dirrell, nothing serious was found during the tests. the question now is whether dirrell will feel the lingering effects from this knockout in his next super six fight against andre ward later on in 2010. ward isn't a huge puncher like abraham, but he does hit hard enough to potentially create problems for dirrell, especially if he's still feeling the effects from his knockout to abraham. abraham's promotional team sauerland plan on protesting the outcome and will be looking for an immediate rematch. the only thing they have is the believe that they think dirrell was acting when he was apparently knocked out. however, it's going to be tough to get anyone to side with their opinion because there's really no way of proving that dirrell was acting short of him coming out and making a confession. that won't happen and it appears that sauerland will be wasting their time with this appeal. march 29, 2010 at 3:17 pm aa is deservadly coming out of this badly. he wasnt really shining in any way during the fight, his low blow took a little to long to be passed of as in the heat of the moment and some of the things he said after the fight left alot to be desired, even if he believed what he was saying. however i do feel a little sorry for him, dirrell frustrated him all night, the ref frustrated him, he was out of his comfort zone fighting away from home and after the dq he was frustrated at what he deemed to be acting by dirrell so the words blurted out. and all the time he knew his 0 record was slipping away from him. not condoning what he did but i think hes getting torn into a little too hard, ive seen things like this happen many time without half the fuss. march 29, 2010 at 3:15 pm @ richard ive watched the slow mo about 100 times. you are special my friend. it was a glancing blow that crazed ad before we slipped, and as he was sitting down, aa took a shot at him, and entirely separate punch. - green thinks also that dirrell was acting - maske also thinks that dirrell was acting for me 2 things stick out: - aa hit ad before ad goes down (watch it in the slow motion) march 29, 2010 at 2:36 pm great article. however, \"little\" is an overstatement. there was such a lack of class in that move, he doesn't even deserve the word. roach thinks
