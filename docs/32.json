The Ewing, N.J.-based company late Thursday said it earned 55 cents a share, up 41% year over year, on sales of $74.6 million, up 20%, in the December quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Universal Display to earn 42 cents a share on sales of $68.6 million. Universal Display, aka UDC, also announced that it will begin paying a quarterly cash dividend next month, starting at 3 cents a share. UDC stock was up over 19%, near 80.80, in morning trading on the stock market today. It topped its previous all-time high of 74.39, reached Aug. 1. IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it has outperformed 75% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 8 out of 40 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Miscellaneous Products industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst <mark>Mehdi Hosseini</mark> reiterated his positive rating on UDC stock and raised his price target to 105 from 100. \"UDC should be viewed as a core holding in a small-cap portfolio, benefiting from multiyear, secular trends in display technology,\" <mark>Hosseini</mark> said in a report. Meanwhile, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti maintained his hold rating on UDC stock, citing a rich valuation. \"We would not chase the stock following what is likely to be a strong open and would look to become more constructive on a pullback,\" he said in a report. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz concurred, saying UDC stock looks fully valued. He maintained his perform rating on the stock Friday. Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy also is cautious on UDC. He reiterated his hold rating, but raised his price target to 65 from 49. \"While we acknowledge the compelling market potential of OLED technology (TVs, mobile phones, VR headsets, etc.) in the near to medium term, monetization pathways for the company need to become further de-risked, in our view, to support a more attractive risk/reward,\" Quealy said in a report. Smartphone makers are beginning to switch to OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, displays from LCD, or liquid-crystal displays, because OLED provides better color reproduction and contrast and uses less power. The displays also are thinner and flexible, allowing for new hardware designs. Apple (AAPL) is rumored to be using OLED displays produced by Samsung in its upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone, which is expected to be released in September. As OLED manufacturing matures, analysts expect TVs and PC displays to shift to OLED from LCD screens as well. Other companies benefiting from the OLED adoption trend include display equipment vendors such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and Coherent (COHR), analysts say.

Andersen Jr., 68, of Standard is wheeled away by a Putnam County deputy sheriff after a Putnam County jury found him guilty Friday of first-degree murder and the concealment of the homicidal death of Deborah Dewey, 62, of Ladd, in 2016. The jury deliberated most of Friday afternoon before announcing its verdict in the 8-day trial. HENNEPIN--A 68-year-old Standard man is guilty of bludgeoning his 62-year-old sister-in-law to death and burying her in a yard near his home, a Putnam County jury ruled late this afternoon. Clifford A. Andersen Jr., who bashed in 62-year-old Deborah Dewey's head, will be sentenced Aug. 23--the 2-year anniversary of her disappearance--for first-degree murder and concealment of her homicide. He faces a minimum of 20 years and up to life in prison with no possibility of parole. The Ladd woman was reported missing on Aug. 23, 2016; her body was found that Sept. 12 buried in the yard of a vacant home blocks from Andersen's, which he cared for. His DNA was mixed with hers in blood that was found inside the home. \"Justice for Debbie has been a long time coming,\" Dewey's niece, Sue Marshall, said this afternoon. The 2-week trial, presided over by Judge Stephen A. Kouri, featured 55 witnesses and more than 600 exhibits. Andersen, who gambled and had taken out numerous high-interest payday loans, was getting money from Dewey, who finally decided to cut him off. That, the prosecution said, was the motive for the killing.

part of an estimated $4 billion a year industry in the united states. oklahoma closed its borders to missouri deer. so did illinois. then louisiana and indiana. one by one, states refused entry permits to people seeking to import deer from missouri. all because of one buck. \"it's sickening, the panic. what am i going to do?\" said <mark>david wood</mark>, who has been unable to move any deer from his breeding farm in linn county, mo., since the outbreak. afflicted deer eventually stagger, grind teeth and starve before death. but most of the animals now being discovered with the disease are outwardly healthy. researchers and industry officials say this is because they are looking more closely for outbreaks. although testing cannot be done on live animals, many states test dead animals. illinois found the disease in a single wild deer in 2002. kansas found it first in 2006, and again last week with 10 deer testing positive. \"if you do enough sampling, you're going to find it,\" said bill pittenger, head of the missouri whitetail breeders and hunting ranch association. missouri began its statewide surveillance for chronic wasting disease in 2002. it finally turned up at heartland wildlife ranches in ethel, mo., 200 miles northwest of st. louis. heartland is a high-end hunting operation, with a sprawling lodge set on 800 acres surrounded by 8-foot fences. hunters come from across the country to take aim at trophy animals such as whitetail deer, elk and zebra. a three-day hunt for water buffalo costs $4,000. the infected deer actually died last fall. months later, as part of the state's regular surveillance program, heartland sent a specimen sample along with other samples to a federal lab in iowa. on feb. 25, the test came back positive. \"i was disappointed. worried. surprised,\" said rob brasher of salt lake city, whose family has owned heartland for two decades. the positive test sent a shudder through missouri's 39 big-game hunting operations and 272 licensed deer breeders, whose operations provide hunters with so-called shooting bucks. the state's deer industry supports the testing program, pittenger said. but members also chafe at how regulators react to an outbreak. as one person complained on a deer hunter's message board, the disease \"is a lot like global warming,\" suggesting that the response was making the problem seem worse than it really is. but government officials say drastic actions are needed to halt the march of a little-understood disease. oklahoma's state veterinarian made no apologies for shutting out deer from missouri \"as soon as we found out\" about the positive test. \"because we don't have cwd in the state of oklahoma, we need to protect our cervid breeders and our native whitetail population,\" said dr. becky brewer. other states took similar action. most states, including oklahoma, have since eased those import restrictions to deer raised closer to heartland, either in a surrounding county or within a 25-mile radius. missouri officials are now trying to determine the size of the outbreak. the 4-year-old infected buck spent its entire life at heartland. the state agriculture department is running the investigation. last weekend, 50 deer were killed at heartland. specimens were sent for testing. results are expected friday or early next week. to see whether the infection jumped the fence line, another 150 wild deer are being culled in a five-mile radius around heartland by the state conservation department. \"it'll be interesting to see what comes with the second round of testing,\" said brasher, owner of heartland. but any test results - positive or negative - will be of little solace for <mark>wood</mark>, who runs the linn county deer farm just 17 miles from heartland. last year, the linneus, mo., machinist decided to step up his small breeding program. he said he spent his savings and borrowed some more to buy a sturdy buck and quality does. he knew it was a gamble. but a baby deer can sell for $4,000 to $8,000. some farmers have even turned to laparoscopic artificial insemination to generate deer herds. but after that one positive test, it no longer mattered that <mark>wood</mark> had taken part in the state's disease surveillance program since its inception. or that he de-wormed and vaccinated his deer. or that it would seem almost impossible for the infection to have spread to his animals. his deer farm was simply too close to heartland for cautious buyers and regulators. he was being blacklisted. \"there is no bright spot for me,\" he said. he thought about it for a moment."}, {"articleID": "2019030520_00575233_W", "names": {"Jessica Mendoza": ["Q19843119", "Q3130679"], "David Wright": ["Q1173399", "Q16217703", "Q21288738", "Q21453256", "Q22122541", "Q260844", "Q2631275", "Q29643824", "Q42323023", "Q45305146", "Q47353608", "Q5241306", "Q5241307", "Q5241308", "Q5241312", "Q5241313", "Q5241314", "Q54675733", "Q57697274", "Q57893530", "Q684849"], "Alex Rodriguez": ["Q17620655", "Q2576780", "Q2641483", "Q558664"]}, "date": "2019-03-05", "url": "https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/sport/espn-star-hired-by-major-league-team/news-story/b22e5a262463c9537f2818e5d0906058", "content": "social-email_circle American TV star <mark>Jessica Mendoza</mark> has been hired as an executive scout for the New York Mets in Major League Baseball.

As for potential conflicts of interest, <mark>Alex Rodriguez</mark>, who works alongside <mark>Mendoza</mark> on \"Sunday Night Baseball,\" also serves in a similar role with the Yankees. \"She has to remain professional in both jobs,\" Van Wagenen said. \"Clearly, there is a confidentiality agreement and understanding that anything she gleans from our operation she is not going to be sharing on her broadcast, and anything she gleans in her course of working other clubhouses she can't bring to us.

himself. \"i know that in the next couple fights that we have, we're going to have some top welterweights fighting, but that's something that we're going to sit down with sean after this event and plan something out, just like we're going to plan out the light heavyweight division and get our champion in that division.\" one strikeforce division that does boast a champion is 185-pounds, and titleholder luke rockhold defends his belt against longtime veteran keith jardine in saturday's main event. jardine took a slot that was originally intended for 32-year-old <mark>tim kennedy</mark> (12-3 mma, 5-1 sf), who has dropped just one of his six career strikeforce outings. <mark>kennedy</mark> was forced to withdraw from the planned matchup with an undisclosed training injury, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's waiting in the wings to challenge the winner, according to coker. mmajunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com). \"after this fight, let's see how the fights go, and then we can reevaluate from there and then get back to you on the next fight.\" in 2011, strikeforce officials declared the pearl at the palms casino resort in las vegas the permanent home of the promotion's \"challengers series\" events. however, when strikeforce and showtime partnered for another year of events on the premium-cable channel, the prospects-driven series was immediately scrapped. strikeforce is kicking off its 2012 schedule in sin city, but the company moved crosstown to the joint at hard rock hotel & casino. coker declined to speculate on the likelihood of a 2012 return to either venue but did say that the company would not be tied down to las vegas. \"it's nice to be in vegas,\" coker told mmajunkie.com. \"this is the home of zuffa and the headquarters of the family. there are tremendous resources here. but this was an event where we felt the free preview weekend would be a great opportunity to have a showcase for our talent, and we made a decision to pull this fight off in a relatively quick manner.\" we felt this was a great opportunity, and luckily the hard rock opened up their doors, and here we are. we're looking forward to putting on more events here in las vegas, but we're also going to go on the road. we're going to be a traveling show and going all over the country. \"the company is next expected to touch down in columbus, ohio, for a march 3

At the same time, crews fan out across the battered island, erecting light poles and power lines in a block by block slog. A month after Hurricane Maria rolled across the center of Puerto Rico, the power is still out for the vast majority of people on the island as the work to restore hundreds of miles of transmission lines and thousands of miles of distribution lines grinds on for crews toiling under a blazing tropical sun. And it won't get done soon without more workers, more equipment and more money, according to everyone involved in the effort. \"It's too much for us alone,\" Nelson Velez, a regional director for the Puerto Rican power authority, said as he supervised crews working along a busy street in Isla Verde, just east of San Juan, on a recent afternoon. \"We have just so many, so many areas affected.\" The office of Gov. <mark>Ricardo</mark> Rossello said Thursday that about 20 percent of the island has service and he has pledged to get that to 95 percent by Dec. 31. For now, though, most of the island's 3.4 million people suffer without air conditioning or basic necessities. Many have resorted to using washboards, now frequently seen for sale along the side of the road, to clean clothes, and sleeping on their balconies and flocking to any open restaurants for relief from daytime temperatures above 90 degrees. \"I thought we would we have power in the metro area by now,\" said <mark>Pablo Martinez</mark>, an air conditioning technician, shaking his head in frustration. Hurricane Maria, which caused at least 48 deaths on the island, made landfall on the southeastern coast near Yabucoa as a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of about 154 mph (248 kph). It passed out of the territory about 12 hours later near Barceloneta in the north, still with sustained winds of about 115 mph (185 kph). The onslaught was sufficient to knock down hundreds of transmission towers and thousands of distribution poles and lines. The storm's path was ideal for taking down the entire grid. Most of Puerto Rico's generating capacity is along the southern coast and most consumption is in the north around San Juan, with steel and aluminum transmission towers up to 90 feet (27 meters) tall running through the mountains in the middle. At least 10 towers fell along the most important transmission line that runs to the capital, entangling it with a secondary one that runs parallel and that lost about two dozen towers in a hard-to-reach area in the center of the island. \"It reminds me of a fireball that just burned everything in its path,\" said Brig. Gen. Diana Holland, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers unit working to clear debris and restore the grid, with nearly 400 troops on the ground. The storm also struck at a terrible time. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority filed for bankruptcy in July. It has put off badly needed maintenance and had just finished dealing with outages from Hurricane Irma in early September. \"You stop doing your typical deferred maintenance, and so you become even that much more susceptible to a storm like Maria and Irma coming and blowing down your towers, water coming up in your substations and flooding them,\" said <mark>Tom Lewis</mark>, president of the Louis Berger Group, which has been supplying generators in Puerto Rico to clients that include the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \"Everything becomes that much more sensitive to any kind of damage whether it be from wind or water.\" PREPA Director <mark>Ricardo Ramos</mark> said the authority is working with the Army Corps of Engineers and contractors to bring in more \"bucket trucks\" and other equipment. It already has about 400 three - to five-member repair crews and is trying to reach 1,000 within three weeks with workers brought in from the U.S. \"With this number of brigades we will be able to advance much more rapidly,\" <mark>Ramos</mark> assured reporters during a recent news conference. PREPA brought in a Montana company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, to help its crews restore the transmission and distribution lines across the island. It has a rolling contract and can bill up to $300 million for its work, said Odalys <mark>de Jesus</mark>, a spokeswoman for the power authority. It is a huge job for a young company, formed in 2015. Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski said previous work restoring transmission lines damaged by wildfires in the western U.S. has prepared them for the Puerto Rico contract. \"We don't like easy,\" he said during a break at one of the company's base camps near Barceloneta. The camp buzzes with activity as helicopters come and go, taking linemen and equipment to the mountain towers, the pilots deftly navigating the lines and mountains to lower men and equipment to the steel-and-aluminum girds high above the trees. Whitefish had about 270 employees in Puerto Rico as of midweek, working both on transmission and distribution. It expects the number to double in the coming weeks if it can find sufficient lodging and transport to the island. Other contractors working in Puerto Rico include Fluor Corp., which was awarded a $336.2 million contract from the Army Corps of Engineers for debris removal and power restoration, and Weston Solutions, which is providing two generators to stabilize power in the capital for $35 million. Their efforts are to restore the system that was in place before the storm, not to build a better one, at least not yet. Gov. Rossello says the island needs to overhaul its power grid, make it less vulnerable and look at alternative sources. He welcomed a proposal by Elon Musk, CEO of electric-car company Tesla, to expand solar energy and has raised the issue of longer-term improvements with Washington. House Speaker <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> seemed to express at least a willingness to consider helping Puerto Rico build back better when he visited the island this month. \"If you going to put up a power line let's put up a power line that can withstand hurricane-force winds,\" he said. \"It makes no sense to put temporary patches on problems that have long term effects.\" Techmanski said Whitefish was making progress on the line that carries about 230,000 volts to San Juan from the Aguirre power plant in the south, which will vastly increase the amount of power reaching the capital. \"We're getting it done,\" he said. But, asked about the goal of getting 95 percent of power back by the end of the year, he wasn't sure: \"It is very optimistic at this point.\" ___ Associated Press writer Danica Coto contributed to this report.
