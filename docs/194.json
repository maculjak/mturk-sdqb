minutes left tied it at 55. durand scott put miami in front to stay with two free throws with 3:01 left, and shane larkin took over a few moments later. he came up with a key steal from hanlan, then buried a momentum-shifting 3 off an inbounds pass to make it 60-55 with 1:49 left. \"it wasn't just me who got the steal,\" larkin said, adding that kenny kadji was in on the trap and teammate rion brown made a heady play to save the ball. \"it was all of us .\" after brown swished a pretty hanging jumper with 57.6 seconds left, and kadji added a free throw to make it 63-55, bc didn't get closer than five points the rest of the way. trey mckinney jones punctuated the victory with a dunk with 17.2 seconds left. \"we just had mental breakdowns\" during the final 3 minutes, hanlan said. \"the little things hurt us .\" larkin scored 15 of his 20 points after halftime, kadji added 15 points and mckinney jones finished with 12 for miami, which shot nearly 70 percent in the second half while making all the plays down the stretch to avoid becoming the acc's first no. 1 seed to lose its tournament opener since 1997. and the hurricanes - who have won at least one acc tournament game in eight of their 10 seasons in the league - have larkin to thank for their latest escape. \"by adding shane to that group (of seniors), he adds an element that allows all of them to play better,\" coach jim larranaga said. \"he's so good at what he does. a lot of times you'll see (larkin) in the first half try to get the ball to (his teammates), and then the second half starts, he starts to pick his spots to attack and score or find the open man. we absolutely needed that .\" larkin also keyed the defensive effort on hanlan, who a day earlier set an acc tournament record for freshmen with 41 points in the first-round win over georgia tech. <mark>ryan anderson</mark> also had 14 points for the eagles, who had their acc-best four-game winning streak snapped and were denied their first semifinal appearance since 2007. they lost twice to miami during the regular season in vastly differing ways: the hurricanes romped by 32 points in coral gables a few weeks after holding on for a one-point win at bc. and for a while, this one looked like a repeat of that blowout - at least until bc dug itself out of a double-digit hole for the second straight day. after rallying from 15 points down to beat the yellow jackets in the first round, the eagles spotted miami a 21-8 lead before closing the half on a 19-4 run and took their first lead when <mark>anderson</mark>'s layup with 4 seconds left made it 27-25. that coincided with a brutally cold spell for miami, which missed 14 of its last 16 shots of the half against a bc team that started pressing the hurricanes and defending them with a zone. \"we got a little passive,\" larranaga said. \"we didn't attack the way we wanted to .\" bc stretched its lead to 30-25 on heckmann's 3-pointer 20 seconds into the half. miami eventually countered with an 11-2 run and took a 48-44 lead on larkin's deep 3, and things remained tight until larkin and the hurricanes finally pulled away.

ushering in all sorts of banality, ineptitude, corruption and debauchery,\" wrote achebe, whose death was confirmed friday by his literary agent, <mark>andrew wylie</mark>. his eminence worldwide was rivaled only by gabriel garcia marquez, toni morrison and a handful of others. achebe was a moral and literary model for countless africans and a profound influence on such american writers as ha jin, junot diaz and morrison, who once called achebe's work an \"education\" for her and \"liberating in a way nothing had been before .\" his public life began in his mid-20s. he was a resident of london when he completed his handwritten manuscript for \"things fall apart,\" a short novel about a nigerian tribesman's downfall at the hands of british colonialists. turned down by several publishers, the book was finally accepted by heinemann and released in 1958 with a first printing of 2,000. its initial review in the new york times ran less than 500 words, but the novel soon became among the most important books of the 20th century, a universally acknowledged starting point for postcolonial, indigenous african fiction, the prophetic union of british letters and african oral culture. \"it would be impossible to say how\" things fall apart' influenced african writing, \"the african scholar kwame anthony appiah once observed .\" it would be like asking how shakespeare influenced english writers or pushkin influenced russians. achebe didn't only play the game, he invented it. \"\"things fall apart\" has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide and has been translated into more than 50 languages. achebe also was a forceful critic of western literature about africa, especially joseph conrad's \"heart of darkness,\" standard reading for millions, but in achebe's opinion, a defining example of how even a great western mind could reduce a foreign civilization to barbarism and menace. \"now, i grew up among very eloquent elders. in the village, or even in the church, which my father made sure we attended, there were eloquent speakers. so if you reduce that eloquence which i encountered to eight words & it's going to be very different,\" achebe told the associated press in 2008. \"you know that it's going to be a battle to turn it around, to say to people,\" that's not the way my people respond in this situation, by unintelligible grunts, and so on; they would speak .' and it is that speech that i knew i wanted to be written down. \"his first novel was intended as a trilogy and the author continued its story in\" a man of the people \"and\" arrow of god. \"he also wrote short stories, poems, children's stories and a political satire,\" the anthills of savannah, \"a 1987 release that was the last full-length fiction to come out in his lifetime. achebe, who used a wheelchair in his later years, would cite his physical problems and displacement from home as stifling to his imaginative powers. achebe never did win the nobel prize, which many believed he deserved, but in 2007 he did receive the man booker international prize, a $120,000 honor for lifetime achievement. achebe, paralyzed from the waist down since a 1990 auto accident, lived for years in a cottage built for him on the campus of bard college, a leading liberal arts school north of new york city where he was a faculty member. he joined brown university in 2009 as a professor of languages and literature. achebe, a native of ogidi, nigeria, regarded his life as a bartering between conflicting cultures. he spoke of the\" two types of music \"running through his mind - ibo legends and the prose of dickens. he was also exposed to different faiths. his father worked in a local missionary and was among the first in their village to convert to christianity. in achebe's memoir\" there was a country, \"he wrote that his\" whole artistic career was probably sparked by this tension between the christian religion \"of his parents and the\" retreating, older religion \"of his ancestors. he would observe the conflicts between his father and great uncle and ponder\" the essence, the meaning, the worldview of both religions. \"for much of his life, he had a sense that he was a person of special gifts who was part of an historic generation. achebe was so avid a reader as a young man that his nickname was\" dictionary. \"at government college, umuahia, he read shakespeare, dickens, robert louis stevenson and jonathan swift among others. he placed his name alongside an extraordinary range of alumni - government and artistic leaders from jaja wachukwa, a future ambassador to the united nations; to future nobel laureate <mark>wole soyinka</mark>; achebe's future wife (and mother of their four children) christine okoli; and the poet christopher okigbo, a close friend of achebe's who was killed during the biafra war. after graduating from the university college of ibadan, in 1953, achebe was a radio producer at the nigerian broadcasting corp., then moved to london and worked at the british broadcasting corp. he was writing stories in college and called\" things fall apart \"an act of\" atonement \"for what he says was the abandonment of traditional culture. the book's title was taken from poet <mark>william butler</mark> yeats'\" the second coming, \"which includes the widely quoted line,\" things fall apart; the centre cannot hold. \"his novel was nearly lost before ever seen by the public. when achebe finished his manuscript, he sent it to a london typing service, which misplaced the package and left it lying in an office for months. the proposed book was received coolly by london publishers, who doubted the appeal of fiction from africa. finally, an educational adviser at heinemann who had recently traveled to west africa had a look and declared:\" this is the best novel i have read since the war. \"in mockery of all the western books about africa, achebe ended\" things fall apart \"with a colonial official observing okonkwo's fate and imagining the book he will write:\" the pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower niger. \"achebe's novel was the opening of a long argument on his country's behalf .\" literature is always badly served when an author's artistic insight yields to stereotype and malice, \"achebe said during a 1998 lecture at harvard university that cited joyce cary's\" mister johnson \"as a special offender .\" and it becomes doubly offensive when such a work is arrogantly proffered to you as your story. some people may wonder if, perhaps, we were not too touchy, if we were not oversensitive. we really were not. \"achebe could be just as critical of his own country. the novels\" a man of the people \"and\" no longer at ease \"were stories of corruption and collapse that anticipated the nigerian civil war of 1967-70 and the years of mismanagement that followed. he not only supported biafra's independence, but was a government envoy and a member of a committee that was to write up the new and short-lived country's constitution. he would flee from nigeria and return many times and twice refused the country's second-highest award, the commander of the order of the federal republic, over the lawlessness in his home state of anambra. in 2011, nigeria's presidency said achebe's refusal\" clearly flies in the face of the reality of nigeria's current political situation. \"achebe responded that\" a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. \"\"i had a strong belief that we would outgrow our shortcomings under leaders committed to uniting our diverse peoples,\" achebe warned. besides his own writing, achebe served for years as editor of heinemann's \"african writer series,\" which published works by nadine gordimer, stephen biko and others. he also edited numerous anthologies of african stories, poems and essays. in \"there was a country,\" he considered the role of the modern african writer. \"what i can say is that it was clear to many of us that an indigenous african literary renaissance was overdue,\" he wrote. \"a major objective was to challenge stereotypes, myths, and the image of ourselves and our continent, and to recast them through stories -
