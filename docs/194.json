Yet, despite President Obama's assertion that \"there was nothing new\" in the speech and that \"the prime minister didn't offer any viable alternatives,\" the Israeli leader actually did propose some reasonable options that bear consideration. The first is making the \"sunset clause\" conditional upon Iranian behavior, not an arbitrary timetable. The current terms under discussion call for a deal that would expire in around 10 years, at which point Iran would be allowed to operate an unlimited number of centrifuges, of unlimited sophistication, to enrich an unlimited amount of uranium. The narrow focus on Iran's nuclear program in the current grand bargain misses the reality that this issue is but the latest bone of contention between Iran and the West. Without nuclear weapons, Iran is still the foremost sponsor of international terrorism with terrorist networks active on five continents. With its recent expansion through terrorist proxies, Tehran now controls four Arab capitals in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Without a definitive change in the regime's behavior, other Arab states won't wait around until the deal expires to acquire their own nuclear capabilities. The Middle East nuclear arms race would begin in earnest immediately. Therefore, any sunset provision should be behavior-based, not time-based. The Israeli leader also raised the issue of verifying Iran's compliance with a deal. This is especially important given that Iran's past nuclear efforts have largely been clandestine or undeclared. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can only report-not prevent or punish-violations of the agreement. And that's only if the nuclear watchdog knows the full breadth of Iran's nuclear program and has unfettered access to any site it chooses. Just this month the IAEA, declared - not for the first time-that Iran was being dilatory in its cooperation with the agency. What about violations? If the central point of an agreement is deterrence, then the penalties need to be agreed upon upfront, not debated as they occur, or worse, debated if they even happened depending on how one reads the deal. Another point Netanyahu raised was the size and scope of the nuclear infrastructure Iran would be permitted to keep. The current discussions would allow for Iran to operate around 6,500 centrifuges, but according to the IAEA former deputy director-general, <mark>Olli Heinonen</mark>, that number goes well beyond what is needed for civilian applications. This issue involves a combination of the number and quality of the centrifuges, their output, and the percentage of enrichment allowed. Finding the right number gets to the heart of the agreement as the only argument in favor of the deal that holds any water is that it would keep Iran at least one year away from being able to breakout toward nuclear weaponization-at least during the period of the agreement. That leads to another problem, which is that American and Israeli intelligence assessments differ over how fast Iran would be able to race toward a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu described the discrepancy as \"about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel's.\" The difference is key because according to U.S. officials, the deal is designed to allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state, just a year away from making the plunge if it decided to break off the agreement. As Robert Satloff, Executive Director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy pointed out, it is questionable whether U.S. analysts can know with certainty if Iran's breakout capability is really one year. Indeed, given the aspects of the program not covered by the agreement, it is unlikely that a year of warning time would remain after three, five, or ten years of the deal. To allay the concerns of critics, the White House might offer Israel a \"nuclear guarantee\" as former American envoy to Israel, Martin suggested. But such an offer is undercut by the perception that the U.S. is retreating from the region, doesn't honor its international commitments, and does not enforce its own red lines such as those drawn in Syria. And why would Israel put its survival in American hands, especially with an administration that has proven so publicly hostile toward the Jewish state? America's word is not what it used to be.

A busy night lies ahead: The Smith Westerns singer is hoping to whip up a killer gumbo and then, if all goes according to plan, stock his newly minted \"smoking room\" with the early-Nineties action figures he's recently become obsessed with. Right now, though, he's ready to spark up again. \"Go easy - this stuff is pretty heavy,\" he warns, sliding a mini-glass bong snugly packed with choice buds across a table in the living room of his messy, college-style Chicago walk-up apartment. Omori's pet fish, Little Pig, looks on from his murky tank. The 23-year-old frontman and his bandmates - brother Cameron Omori, 21, on bass, and longtime friend Max Kakacek, 22, on guitar - finished recording their third studio album, Soft Will, last October. Save for a pair of Coachella gigs in April, life for the three longhaired musicians has resembled one long, hazy weed nap since then. The daydream ends next month, when they head out on a nationwide tour behind the new album. - The Daily Mail and Perez Hilton are two of his favorites - and messed around with a guitar that he recently outfitted with a marijuana-themed pick guard. Cameron overslept, the result of an up - 'til -3:00 a.m. bender playing Candy Crush on his iPhone. Kakacek, the most put-together of the three (if only by process of elimination), had already met a friend for coffee and a chicken salad sandwich by mid-afternoon; he even found time to stop by the bank to withdraw some money for the early-Eighties Jeep Wrangler he wants to buy. Playing in Smith Westerns is the only job these guys have ever known.

Cullen moved into an apartment with Kakacek in the hipster-friendly Logan Square neighborhood; he later moved down the streeet to his current place, where he lives with his girlfriend. Cameron is still figuring out his plans, so he moved back in with his and Cullen's parents in the northern Chicago neighborhood of Sauganash. \"It was the first time since 2009 that we had this huge gap of time,\" Cullen recalls of their life after the Dye It Blonde tour. After an enjoyable stretch spent doing nothing, the trio got back to writing new songs; last summer, they headed out to Sonic Ranch Studios in El Paso, Texas, to record Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV On The Radio). Adds Cullen, \"It was nice to get out and go to this weird, isolated place.\" On most days, the trio holed up in the studio from mid-afternoon until the early morning hours. New drummer Julien Ehrlich, formerly of Unknown Mortal Orchestra, joined them for the sessions - the first time they'd recorded with a full band. Cameron recalls the sessions' loose, freewheeling vibe: \"I feel like Dye It Blonde was the [album] where there was a little more pressure.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. The global flavored water market will be growing both in terms of revenue and volume during the forecast period. The growth is expected to be primarily due to changing consumer lifestyle and preferences and growing health awareness among the consumers. These factors have resulted in the development of different varieties of flavors which are fueling the growth of the global flavored water market. Flavored water has emerged as a ready-to-drink (RTD) health beverage. It is a better substitute for carbonated drinks owing to its nutritional benefits. <mark>Atul Kumar</mark>, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on non-alcoholic beverages sector, says, \"The Americas is the leading region in the global flavored water market, and is expected to witness a high growth rate during the forecast period. Since flavored water is enriched with minerals, vitamins, and natural flavors, the product attracts many health-conscious consumers.\" This report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only: View market snapshot before purchasing Buy 1 Technavio report and get the second for 50% off.

Introduction of new flavors The global flavored water market is witnessing an increasing demand for new flavors and consumers are demanding innovative and exotic flavors. Therefore, players are responding by adding new flavors to their product lines. The competition is becoming intense in the market and players are coming up with various new flavors to stay ahead of the competitors. \"Flavored water products with raspberry, strawberry, pineapple, cucumber, and watermelon have been introduced in the market. Considering this trend among consumers, flavored water manufacturers are introducing many new flavors. H2ROSE uses rose water to create a sweet and fragrant drink, and H2ROSE water comes in four different flavors such as mango, peach, wild berry, and apple,\" according to <mark>Atul</mark>. Innovation in packaging Manufacturers are coming up with innovative packaging that is convenient to carry and enable consumption directly from the package while on-the-go. Consumers are now demanding transparent, labeled, and smaller pack size and that are environment-friendly. Coca-Cola has come up with the plant-based packaging bottle, which is a bio-based plant bottle packaging. Companies such as PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Danone, and Nestl\u00e9 are taking the initiative to support for 100% sustainable packaging and increase packaging recovery and recycling rates. Expansion of flavored water market in emerging economies The markets of flavored water in countries like the US are becoming saturated for flavored water. To survive in the market and continue making profits, the vendors of flavored water need to tap new market and customer base. Flavored water, being a functional beverage and having several alternatives, was not that popular in emerging economies. Soft drinks and caffeine-rich drinks like tea and coffee are already in high demand in these nations. Although flavored water by key vendors like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo are present in certain countries but are generally consumed by the upper strata of the society and affluent customers. The key vendors are as follows: Coca-Cola Hint Nestl\u00e9 PepsiCo Browse Related Reports: Global Sparkling Juices Market 2017-2021 Coconut Water Market in Europe 2017-2021 Global Marzipan Market 2017-2021 About Technavio Technavio is a leading global technology research and advisory company.

Read the story The city's police force was rocked by a sex abuse scandal that has stalled the department's effort to emerge from more than a decade of federal oversight. The Oakland Raiders football team is threatening to move to Las Vegas. Local leaders are struggling to keep the city affordable despite a rising tide of wealth from the tech boom. And all of that was before the deadliest fire in Oakland's history ripped through a warehouse Dec. 2, killing 36 people who had gathered for an underground concert. The tragedy was compounded by subsequent revelations that the city appeared to have never inspected the building. When Schaaf stepped to the microphone at a nighttime vigil three days after the blaze, mourners shouted \"go home.\" The boos grew louder as she talked about addressing safety issues in loosely regulated warehouses where artists work and live.

Red Cross workers outside the Ghost Ship warehouse Dec. 7. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) \"This city is going to go through a lot of emotions and one of them is going to be anger and that's part of my job--to hear that and feel that,\" she told the crowd. \"My job is to keep this city and this community together right now.\" Whether she accomplishes that job may define Schaaf's tenure as mayor of a city that's already undergoing what she describes as \"a radical transformation.\" Cracking down on unsafe buildings could cause evictions, inflaming tensions in a city that declared a housing emergency this year. But doing nothing doesn't seem to be an option either. \"If she doesn't do something quick, and come up with solutions, I don't know how she moves forward,\" said Joseph Sarapochillo, a real estate developer. \"This is just not going to go away.\" Schaaf, 51, one of California's few prominent female elected officials, arrived in office with a solid political pedigree. A former lawyer, she started working in local government as an Oakland City Council aide, then under Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> when he was mayor. She served as a City Council member for four years before beating out a crowded field of candidates in 2014 to become mayor herself. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories If Schaaf wants to seek higher office, she already has the team she needs--she's represented by the same high-powered political consultants at SCN Strategies as <mark>Brown</mark> and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Once a high school cheerleader, the Oakland-born mayor has been an ebullient booster for her hometown. She wears earrings in the shape of the oak tree the city is named after and considers herself a defender of Oakland's \"secret sauce.\" She says city bureaucrats are really \"fantasti-crats\" and promotes \"techquity,\" her buzzword for ensuring the technology industry's boom benefits rather than displaces low-income residents. Last year the ride-sharing company Uber announced plans for a new office with up to 3,000 employees in downtown Oakland, a development that Schaaf hopes will bring a much-needed economic boost to a city with entrenched poverty. \"She has a lot of goodwill built up,\" said Don Perata, a former state Senate president who unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Oakland. But the city, which is home to a large activist community, has earned a reputation for being difficult to govern. \"Your honeymoon is brief,\" Perata said. \"And the problems are one after another.\" Schaaf's predecessor, Jean Quan, was hobbled by her response to Occupy Oakland protesters in 2011. She initially allowed them to camp out by City Hall, but police later forced protesters to vacate in violent confrontations.

Schaaf said she wants to address the former and preserve the latter, improving safety while also ensuring that Oakland remains an eclectic haven for artists. \"It would be another tragedy if we didn't take this moment to improve our systems,\" she said. \"We can still always do better, and that's part of what we owe everyone who has been affected by this tragedy.\" The city convened a task force after the fire, but threading the needle won't be easy. Activists are already wary of an administration they feel has been too cozy with developers who are eager to renovate older buildings or demolish them to make way for higher-priced dwellings. And political opponents criticized Schaaf as slow to get a handle on problems within her administration. \"For someone who has been in city government for as long as Libby Schaaf has been, her failure to get on top of what some of these departments is doing is really inexcusable,\" said <mark>Dan Siegel</mark>, a civil rights lawyer who ran against Schaaf in the 2014 mayor's race.

Here are the names of those who have been confirmed dead by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office Coroner's Bureau or immediate family members. Did you know one of the victims...(Los Angeles Times Staff) The Police Department, which is struggling to emerge from federal oversight that began in 2003 after a pattern of civil rights abuses, has been another challenge for Schaaf. A new scandal erupted this year when a 19-year-old woman accused several officers of having sex with her when she was underage. Besides criminal charges for some officers, the scandal has caused widespread turmoil within the department. The chief resigned, and his two successors resigned soon after. The department has been run by a civilian city administrator since June, and the chief position remains unfilled. Barry Donelan, president of the Oakland Police Officers' Assn., Association said the turmoil has been demoralizing and prompted some to leave the force. \"The uncertainty among the rank-and-file fuels that,\" he said. <mark>John Burris</mark>, a civil rights lawyer who brought the lawsuit that led to federal oversight more than a decade ago and now represents the young woman in the recent scandal, said Schaaf was doing the best she could in a difficult situation. \"This is the job you ask for, right?\" he said. \"Every year, something comes up.\" Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, left, speaks beside Oakland Chief of Police Sean Whent in May.

He resigned amid a department sex-crimes scandal this summer. (Ben Margot / Associated Press) One of those things is the potential for the Oakland Raiders to leave the city, something they've threatened before. Nevada has lined up $750 million in public money to lure the team. By comparison, Schaaf's plan to keep the Raiders in Oakland, which is being placed before the City Council and county supervisors for a vote Tuesday, includes $350 million in public resources, including infrastructure investments and land for a new stadium. Although the proposal leaves taxpayers on the hook for less, it's unlikely to be enough to satisfy the Raiders or the National Football League, which has the final say on whether the team is allowed to move. In the midst of all of these challenges, Schaaf is still trying to carve out time for long-term plans to improve the city. She highlighted a partnership with philanthropists and businesses, the Oakland Promise, to help students graduate high school and attend college. \"We can't just be reactive to crises,\" she said. \"We have to invest in sustainable, comprehensive solutions.\" On Saturday, she attended a meeting in Mosswood, a hub for the city's African American community, the quickly gentrifying Temescal neighborhood, where another fire destroyed a recreation center that housed programs for elementary school children and teens with developmental disabilities. After Schaaf spoke to the crowd, she answered questions from residents and chatted with retired NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, who grew up nearby. Cynthia Armstrong, 37, said she feels for the mayor. \"This is the type of city where there is constantly something happening,\" she said. \"So how do you stop and pause to fix some things that you inherited if the next crisis is always at hand? I think she is doing the best that she can at this point.\" Caption Kanye West at <mark>Trump</mark> Tower Kanye West and President-elect <mark>Donald Trump</mark> met in the <mark>Trump</mark> Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Release Date: 08/23/2013 Contact Information: David Deegan, (617)? 918-1017 (Boston, Mass. - August 23, 2013) - A commercial waste handler in Rhode Island has agreed to pay a fine of $58,278 and to spend $252,152 to clean hazardous chemicals out of approximately 60 schools in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in order to settle EPA claims that the company violated state and federal hazardous waste laws at a facility in Providence, R.I. Northland Environmental and its owner, PSC Environmental Services, will remove chemicals from 60 high schools and middle schools within a 50-mile radius of their Providence facility at 275 Allens Ave. where the violations occurred. The companies have agreed to pack up and properly dispose of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes stored at the schools; to do hazardous waste training for science and art teachers; and to purchase safety equipment such as storage cabinets for flammable chemicals, eye washes and deluge showers for classrooms where hazardous chemicals are used. This project will be done over 18 months during times when the schools are closed. EPA alleged that Northland/PSC Environmental Services violated the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and state hazardous waste laws by failing to properly identify certain hazardous wastes and failing to properly maintain hazardous waste tanks and containers. These alleged violations could have resulted in the release of hazardous wastes to the environment. The company also stored incompatible hazardous wastes next to one another, creating a potential for fire or explosions. The company quickly came into compliance after the violations were identified. \"All facilities that generate or manage hazardous wastes have an obligation to make sure they carefully adhere to the environmental requirements that result in safer, cleaner communities,\" said Curt Spalding, regional administrator of EPA's New England office. \"This case will have a positive outcome, since the projects under this settlement will help provide safer classrooms at many schools in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\" The school clean outs will involve removing outdated and unwanted chemicals from schools at no cost to the participating schools. Chemical management is often a low priority for schools and it is not uncommon for school science departments to have outdated and unneeded stock chemicals present. \"I want to thank the EPA and the Cranston School Department for working cooperatively to provide a safe environment for our students,\" said City of Cranston Mayor Allan Fung. \"We are pleased to see funds from EPA actions like this reinvested in making Rhode Island a cleaner and safer place,\" said Terrence Gray, P.E., Associate Director for Air, Waste and Compliance at the RI Department of Environmental Management. \"For many years, DEM has directly supported school districts across Rhode Island by removing old and unnecessary chemicals, but that effort has always been limited by the resources we have available. This recent investment extends this important initiative so that more of these dangerous materials can be taken out of our schools, providing a much safer environment for students and educators.\" \"The science classroom environment is of the utmost importance as we work to support teaching and learning for students and teachers. Safety is our first concern so we were delighted to have a partnership with the EPA Integrated Chemical Management Program (ICM) who worked with our science teachers to inventory, organize chemicals, with regards to safety and to the benefit of classroom use. Working with this program provided our teachers with invaluable insights with regards to managing chemical supplies. The ultimate goal is to maximize safety and learning of science inquiry in Cranston Public Schools,\" said Dr. Judith Lundsten, Superintendant Cranston Public Schools. Rhode Island schools within a 50-mile radius of the Northland facility were sent emails letting them know of this opportunity to have toxic, hazardous, or chemicals prohibited by the state removed by participating in this project. Schools that were interested provided a list of the chemicals that need to be removed. Cranston, R.I. is using the opportunity to provide both East and West High School with chemical cleanouts before school starts on Aug. 27. In addition to paying the fine and completing the environmental project, Northland/PSC has agreed to make sure the Providence facility remains in compliance with federal and state hazardous waste management regulations. Northland/PSC's Providence facility accepts and handles a broad spectrum of wastes including acids, alkalis, flammable wastes, water reactive wastes, cyanides, sulfides, oxidizers, toxic wastes, oily wastes, photochemical wastes and laboratory packs. Hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are received, stored and or consolidated and then shipped off site for treatment or disposal.

signs of compromise in u.s. talks to stop automatic tax hikes and spending cuts hurting the economy next year pushed world shares towards a three-month high on tuesday and weakened appetite for safe-haven bonds and the dollar. the political divide narrowed on monday night when president barack obama proposed leaving lower tax rates in place for those earning under $400,000, moving closer to the $1 million threshold favoured by republican house of representatives speaker john boehner. european shares were up 0.3 percent and closing in on 2012 highs ahead of the wall street open. the s & p 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq 100 were also expected to rise. the rally pushed the msci index of global stocks up 0.2 percent to the brink of a three-month high, with an 18-month peak also in sight. \"it is reassuring that we are now seeing some signs of compromise in the u.s.,\" said daiwa securities economist tobias blattner. \"a deal is key to avoiding a major global recession; if we were to fall over the cliff, there would be massive fiscal tightening.\" the dollar, a traditional safe-haven currency, fell to a two-month low against a basket of currencies, as the broader market appetite for risk strengthened. oil and copper, two commodities closely attuned to global growth expectations both gained, although profit taking saw the latter edge back to $8,026 per tonne as the european session tailed off. \"one would assume that this (fiscal cliff deal progress) would be a positive for commodities,\" said stephen briggs, metals strategist at bnp paribas in london. \"but because base metals have been faring pretty well in the last few weeks, there may be less mileage for them.\" expectations of more monetary easing in japan following sunday's return to power of the ldp and its pro-stimulus leader shinzo? abe added to the optimism and provided additional support for the nikkei which hit an 8-1/2 month high. it also kept the yen near a 20-month low versus the dollar. by 1300 gmt the dollar was worth 83.90 yen, up almost 7 percent compared to when it started rising in early november. \"we are in a situation where we will see the government tell the central bank what to do. such a politicised situation is never good for a currency, and the yen will weaken,\" said peter kinsella, currency strategist at commerzbank. with the european central bank looking increasingly unlikely to cut interest rates in the next couple of months, the euro remained near monday's seven-month high at $1.3175. newly installed ecb board member yves mersch said he saw no logic in cutting rates at the moment. data from the uk showed inflation stayed at its highest level since may, confounding forecasts it would ease and potentially giving the bank of england less room to resume its quantitative easing to support the struggling economy. however, sweden cut its interest rates back to 1 percent, turkey cut rates for the first time in more than a year, while india's central bank reiterated its guidance of further easing in the first quarter of 2013. in bond markets, trading remained subdued ahead of the year-end. u.s and german government bonds futures slipped as increasing signs of progress in the u.s. budget talks eased demand for low-risk assets. concerns that new fiscal stimulus could seriously increase the country's debt burden pushed the benchmark 10-year japanese government bond yield to a one-month high of 0.750 percent. with the thin trade accentuating moves, spanish debt extended gains after its final bill sale of the year raised more than the target amount. spanish 10-year bond yields fell 7.5 basis points to 5.38 percent while the equivalent italian debt fell 8 bps to 4.49 percent, back to where it was before prime minister <mark>mario monti</mark> sparked a wave of selling earlier this month by announcing he would resign early. we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see our flagship financial information platform incorporating reuters insider an ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution a connected approach to governance, risk and compliance, and interactive television platforms. thomson reuters journalists are subject to an"}, {"articleID": "2018112116_00187422_W", "names": {"Rich Cronin": ["Q466751", "Q7323227"]}, "date": "2018-11-21", "url": "http://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/lfo-singer-devin-lima-dead-at-41-reports-say/876524903?utm_source=homestream&utm_medium=site_navigation&utm_campaign=homestream_click", "content": "LFO singer Devin Lima dead at 41, reports say Need a profile?
