Chairman <mark>Sir John</mark> O\u2019Hara QC scrutinised the deaths of five children from the condition last year and heavily criticised a \"cover-up\" by some consultants, accusing some doctors of behaving \"inadequately, evasively, dishonestly and ineptly\". On Tuesday he published an update on the adequacy of searches in 2004 of what were then Western Health Board properties for documents relevant to the probe. <mark>Sir John</mark> identified a failure at leadership level after the whistleblower raised concerns in the public interest. He added: \"However, there was a serious failure to address these concerns, whether to investigate them properly or judge them fairly .\" The wrong conclusions were reached. \"This was a failure at leadership level within the healthcare service .\" Not only was the whistleblower failed but so too was the service. \"He said confidence in the critically important systems of whistleblowing depended upon fairness and professionalism .\" These were absent. It is unsettling to be compelled to this conclusion given the many reassurances urged upon me by senior Health and Social Care Board officials. \"He added:\" Whilst it is for others to determine why this particular whistleblower's concerns were not accorded proper response, I reiterate my recommendation that the highest priority be accorded the development and improvement of leadership skills within the healthcare service. \"The brothers of Raychel Ferguson, who died of hyponatraemia in 2001, (from left) Stephen, Jamie and Jason (Brian Lawless/PA) The High Court judge found three deaths from hyponatraemia, a lack of sodium in the blood, were avoidable and the youngsters received unacceptable care during the administration of intravenous fluids. His update said an internal investigation by the Health and Social Care Board ought to have concluded that:--There were gaps in the search for documents in 2004 .--The senior civil servant in the department of health was misled in 2004 as to the completeness of the searches undertaken within the board, for documentation relating to the deaths of Lucy Crawford and Raychel Ferguson .--There was a failure by the health and social care board in 2013 to bring relevant information to the attention of the inquiry, leaving it misinformed. The update said:\" That the Western Health and Social Services Board should have failed to conduct appropriate searches, and misled as to the extent of those searches, is profoundly unsatisfactory and is to be criticised. \"The Health and Social Care Board welcomed the fact that no amendment to the\" essential findings \"of <mark>Sir John</mark>'s report as published in January 2018 is required. It acknowledged issues raised in the summary report and accepted there was scope for learning .\" It is also important to stress that the panel members carried out a very complex investigation within a constrained timeline with honesty, integrity and dedication. \"This was done in line with the whistleblowing policy which provides for anonymity of the whistleblower in accordance with relevant legislation .\" The panel members were acutely aware of the seriousness of the whistleblower's concerns, given the tragic circumstances which led to the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, and strived to consider the issues raised in a fair and impartial manner. \"The HSCB is firmly committed to working with the wider healthcare system to ensure that any learning is fully taken on board .\" 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2014050921_00073989_W", "names": {"Jack Reed": ["Q528979", "Q6114777", "Q6114779", "Q6114783"]}, "date": "2014-05-09", "url": "http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/senate-ecig-letter-64660/", "content": "By: Martha Garcia | Published: May 9th, 2014 Eight U.S. senators are calling on the FDA to impose stronger restrictions on electronic cigarettes, after new research suggests that some e-cigarettes can produce harmful chemicals similar to those released by traditional cigarettes. letter to the FDA yesterday, asking the agency to recognize two new studies that highlight the harmful byproducts of e-cigarettes. The effort, spearheaded by Massachusetts Senator Edward J. Markey, was also backed by Senators Sherrod Brown, Barbara Boxer, Jeff Merkley, <mark>Jack Reed</mark>, Richard Blumenthal, Tom Harkin and Dick Durbin. The two studies the group of senators highlight describe the many harmful chemicals which may be released in the vapor of e-cigarettes, including formaldehyde and other potential carcinogens. The studies dispel the idea that e-cigarettes contain less toxins than regular cigarettes, as a myth. The letter urges the FDA to recognize the potential impact e-cigarettes may have on the health of users and secondhand inhalers. It also asks the agency to consider the findings of the studies when \"These products put at risk not only adults and youth who use these devices, but potentially also those who are involuntarily exposed to secondhand vapors,\" write the Senators in the letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg. Concerns Over E-Cigarette Use By Youths The FDA recently announced its plan to begin regulating e-cigarettes, after continued indecision concerning oversight of the products by the agency. However, under the new enforcement move the FDA said it will not ban the use of flavors in the products, a highly controversial decision. Critics say the wide array of flavors is one ploy used by e-cigarette companies to attract teen users. The range of teen friendly flavors, including cotton candy, bubble gum, peanut butter and jelly and hundreds more, has spurred the use of e-cigarettes to doubled among high school students in only one year. congressional report revealed e-cigarette makers are targeting teens with candy-like flavors and marketing campaigns using celebrities, in an effort to drive sales. The report asserts is the aggressive campaigns are creating a new class of users who will be more likely to become addicted to traditional cigarettes. \"Makers of these products have taken advantage of a regulatory black hole by marketing these new nicotine delivery products directly to youth,\" said the statement. Currently, the limitations on smoking in public spaces does not apply universally to all e-cigarette products, including hookah pens, liquid nicotine products and e-liquids. The senators hope to spur the FDA into creating regulations which will govern the use of these products in public areas, hopefully protecting the public from harmful side effects. A recent report released by the New York Times found heating the liquid used in e-cigarettes at high temperatures can produce vapors which carry dangerous toxins. Some users have also taken to a new process called \"dripping,\" where users apply nicotine liquid directly to the heating element on the device. This intensely and rapidly heats the liquid, offering the user a nicotine rush. In the process, causing a chemical reaction which creates carcinogens similar to those present in traditional cigarettes. \"We simply cannot afford to lag behind in our complete understanding of the health consequences to the user and bystander of these and other advanced nicotine delivery products,\" wrote Markey.

swedish cyborgs who use incredibly advanced technology to \"assimilate\" others into their collective so as to make themselves more perfect. they move from planet to planet, incorporating the inhabitants and their technology into the <mark>borg</mark> collective and stripping planets of all resources. although repeated assertions have been made that they bear an uncanny resemblance to microsoft, any such comparison is angrily rejected by the <mark>borg</mark>. incorporation into the <mark>borg</mark> turns a person into a robotic being, a rigid, soulless automaton devoid of character, individuality, or emotion, rather like keanu reeves or hillary clinton. despite being so advanced, whenever the <mark>borg</mark> walk they stagger around in a stiff and clumsy fashion, like al gore after six beers. in their spare time, the <mark>borg</mark> run a taxi service for the emperor of morley to get a bit of pin money. origins of the <mark>borg</mark> \"your resistance just

life devouring the intruders. but the gay psyche was too strong and came to dominate the nanotech, upon which the <mark>borg</mark> arose out of the protoplasma with only one goal: assimilate! borgification \"in soviet russia, you assimilate <mark>borg</mark>!\" ~ luc-picard on borgification <mark>borg</mark> nanoprobes in action. the process of being assimilated is called borgification. the <mark>borg</mark> remove useless parts of the organic being (such as that little thingy that hangs down in the back of your throat) and the body is upgraded with the installation of cybernetic components, for instance, microchips, fiber optics, lithium power cells, lasers, lots and lots of wires and cables and hoses, inkjet printers, servo motors, toasters, and a robotic little thingy to hang down the back of your throat. during the process the individual is forced to watch \"barney and friends meets teletubbies\" on a windows computer for three days straight to break down any remaining traces of soul or consciousness. the resulting borgified human is a soulless drone without any individuality, a mere cog in a vast, unfeeling machine of destruction. on the plus side, you now have the ability to store up to 200 hours of music on your built-in 30 gb hard drive. there is talk of a huge 1tb hard drive for some <mark>borg</mark>, but these are unlikely to be implemented

from millions of worlds contribute to the <mark>borg</mark> collective, including humans, romulans, cardassians, sporks and vulcans. however, not all <mark>borg</mark> member species are humanoid. among the non-humanoid <mark>borg</mark> are the cute little kitten pictured here. <mark>borg</mark> vessels may also include borgified pets such as goldfish, parrots and turtles, or livestock such as cows and llamas. after all, there's no particular reason the species you assimilate has to be intelligent if you're just going to subsume it into a hive-mind anyway. the lack of prehensile appendages can quickly be fixed by attaching a spare human arm or two. however, the problem with assimilating too many species without opposable thumbs is that unless you've got a lot of extra human appendages laying around, the collective quickly ends up short-handed. after the destruction of the <mark>borg</mark> queen's vessel, the <mark>borg</mark> where forced to influence alies, like the ottoman empire in the 19th century. enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> enemies of the <mark>borg</mark> consist of pretty much anybody who isn't <mark>borg</mark>. in no particular order: the federation. the <mark>borg</mark> launched an attack on earth to assimilate its population. they were only stopped when skynet and dr. who's cybermen launched copyright-infringement lawsuits against them. the klingons. the <mark>borg</mark> have decided to simply exterminate the klingons rather than assimilate them, because it's really a pain in the ass to get metal components to stick onto those funky foreheads. the fjord. the fjord are a race which split off from the main <mark>borg</mark> collective thousands of years ago. they are exactly the same as the <mark>borg</mark>, except they speak with a norwegian accent. to this day, the fjord and the <mark>borg</mark> remain bitter enemies, forever divided over the issue of whether or not to speak with a norwegian accent. the fjord also smell vaguely of smoked salmon, which is another reason the <mark>borg</mark> don't like them. rust kittens. the war between the <mark>borg</mark> and the planet of cute little defenseless kittens lasted about 23 seconds, after which the kittens accepted the unconditional surrender of the <mark>borg</mark> and told them to get off their planet. \"that piece of metal no-one cut off'. the piece of metal

help survive a <mark>borg</mark> attack. get the all invincible crew of voyager to kill them for you. if you can, run, although the <mark>borg</mark> ships are capable of moving at incredible speeds. install a sexually transmitted computer virus into data and make him rape the <mark>borg</mark>. use photon torpedoes. and quantum torpedoes. and transphasic torpedoes. and chroniton torpedoes. use your phasers, rapidly shifting frequencies to stay ahead of the <mark>borg</mark>'s ability to shift their shields. the <mark>borg</mark> can rapidly adapt to your phaser fire. use unconventional means of attack such as spreading nasty rumors behind their backs to all their friends. wait...they don't have any friends. never mind. shoot them with holographic bullets from your holographic tommy gun point and laugh at their ugly face. if the <mark>borg</mark> nevertheless invade your ship, try to fit in. if the <mark>borg</mark> think you're already one of them, you won't be assimilated. dance\" the robot \". try covering yourself with aluminum foil. pull some tubing from their heads. hit them with a blunt object. they won't expect it. shine a laser pointer at their scanners. throw worf at them. ridges facing front of course. make kirk do them. put your finger on their chest, say\" you've got something on your shirt \", and when they look down, hit and run. correct their pronunciation of the word\" futile \". magnets. lots and lots of magnets. make them go to sleep. the common cold. get them to see an optical illusion. interpreting the pointless seems efficient against borgs. see philosophy. break off an extended part of their mechanical body. masturbate assimilate them. rickroll them. since they are notoriously slow-moving, just walk away. cover your eyes. the <mark>borg</mark> are notorious for thinking if you can't see them, they can't see you. just download vista into their hard drive. history the <mark>borg</mark> tried other methods of assimilation, but then the writers all wen on strike. violence was more fun anyway. <mark>borg</mark> started their career performing in low-class sundsvall pubs in exchange for beer. sideshow's real parents died in 1982 and for some reason bequeathed sideshow with a music studio in nearby france. the band then decided on a name (<mark>borg</mark>) and cut their first demo tape. the instruments were shoddily played, and the music was crap. <mark>borg</mark> sent their demo tape to all the major, minor, and produced-out-of-basement labels. somehow, their demo tape landed in the hands of <mark>kevin smith</mark>, a visionary filmmaker whose first project was 1984's footloose, an epic story of love and heartbreak in the caribbean starring ross gellar. <mark>kevin</mark> was intrigued by the raw, emotionless music and decided to include <mark>borg</mark> on the movie's soundtrack. following the release of footloose, <mark>borg</mark> skyrocketed to popularity and got their first top-40 hit with\" i wannabe assimilated \". the following year, <mark>borg</mark> produced their first album, the inimitable first contact. the tone and style of their new album was much more mainstream and accessible. the album soon went triple diamond. following the release of the album, in 1985,\" resistance is futile (give me all your love) \"hit #1 and stayed there for all 52 weeks.

The group will make its annual stop in Kenai on Friday at Kenai Central High School. By ELIZABETH EARL Peninsula Clarion Most people don't see the tuba as a lead instrument. But on Friday, the University of Alaska Anchorage's Wind Ensemble plans to put the big brass horn in the spotlight. The ensemble will make its 11th annual stop at Kenai Central High School on Friday. The group, composed of woodwind instruments and brass, is mostly music students from the university, but some are students from other departments and members of the community, according to Dr. Mark Wolbers, the ensemble's conductor. \"If you think about orchestras, most of their repertoire is going to be 19th, 18th century pieces,\" Wolbers said. \"Their mainstay is Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms. When you do wind band conducting, you tend to be conducting more modern works that were composed within the last 100 years .\" The featured piece, \"Tuba Concerto,\" was written 61 years ago by British composer Edward Gregson and runs a hefty 19 minutes, Wolbers said. Because the tuba is a newer instrument--invented in the mid-19th century and still largely a support instrument--there are few pieces in the tuba's repertoire. Gregson's piece was considered the first concerto for tuba, Wolbers said. The music he selected for the ensemble, which tours Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula in the fall, centers around a connection to British band music. Brass bands were common in the U.K. throughout the 20th century, forming the centerpiece for many communities. Some still exist today, Wolbers said. \"Even though our music comes from around the world--we have a piece from New Zealand--it was originally arranged for British brass band, and we have an Australian composer,\" Wolbers said. \"And a piece by Vaughan Williams...it all has the former British Empire kind of relationship .\" The band will play selections from the works of <mark>Peter Graham</mark>, Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams as well as an American composer, Eric Whitacre. The tuba concerto will be anchored by Jeffrey Manley, an adjunct professor at UAA and former U.S. Air Force musician. Manley has toured the U.S. and most of Alaska, he said--including every single school in the Bering Strait School District in northern Alaska. \"In all those villages, the school is the central place,\" Manley said. \"It's where everything happens. When the plane lands and you're not from there, suddenly you become a minor celebrity. The whole village would turn out .\" The tuba has been a lifelong commitment, Manley said. The fifth of six siblings, he said he grew up watching his older sisters and brothers enter the band class and select instruments and knew the tuba was for him. He marched for five years with the Cavaliers Drum & Bugle Corp. in Chicago and served 20 years as an Air Force musician, playing in Tacoma, Washington and eventually in Anchorage. He primarily works at Alaska Music & Sound: Home of the Horn Doctor in Anchorage but took an adjunct position teaching applied music for the tuba at UAA. That was when Wolbers approached him with the idea of playing \"Tuba Concerto\" with the wind ensemble. \"A lot of people don't think of the tuba as a solo instrument, but we deserve the recognition,\" Manley said. Wolbers said the music scene has grown in Alaska since he began teaching at UAA in 1992. His first band class included six students; today, he teaches classes with ensembles of up to 40, he said. Even the community members come from other trades and play music on the side, he said. \"I think (the arts scene) has matured quite a bit,\" Wolbers said. \"You see that everywhere, even down on the peninsula. You think about the last 20 years, what's happened with the Kenai Peninsula Orchestra. It's quite different than what it was when I came here .\" The concert will be held at the Kenai Central High School Henderson Auditorium from noon to 1 p.m. on Friday. Admission is free."}, {"articleID": "2018110423_00414404_W", "names": {"Bobby Moore": ["Q4935388", "Q4935389", "Q4935390"]}, "date": "2018-11-04", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7657865/thierry-henry-monaco-flops-reims-loss/", "content": "By Daniel Cutts Invalid Date, THIERRY HENRY has blasted his Monaco flops for lacking desire and refusing to play the way he wants.

Even the most conservative Republicans were starting to talk about this challenge in rather urgent terms. In a moment whose irony he noted, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told a bunch of rich Republicans gathered by the Brothers Koch earlier this year that those doing well in America were\" the top 1 percent, the millionaires and billionaires the president loves to demagogue, one or two of whom are here with us tonight \"while the\" people who have been hammered for the last six years are working men and women. \"And on it went through the country's top Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla ., stressed\" opportunity inequality \"and Mitt Romney, in another ironic turn, charged that\" under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer. \"It would be wonderful if conservatives really wanted to deal constructively with the predicament they so passionately describe. But thanks to the House and Senate GOP budgets, we now know that conservatives and Republicans (1) aren't serious about the plight of working class and lower income Americans, and (2) would actually make their situations much worse. Their spending plans fail even on conservative terms: They are not fiscally responsible. Instead, they rely on all sorts of magic tricks that shove choices and problems down the road. One heartening sign is that at least some conservatives find these budgets ridiculous. For example, James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute headlined his commentary for The Week:\" The disappointing unseriousness of the House GOP's budget. \"Pethokoukis wrote:\" House Republicans say they want to balance the federal budget and eventually eliminate the federal debt. They do not have a plan to do so. Oh, to be sure, they have a plan! Just not a realistic one that will actually accomplish their goals. \"He noted that of the $5.5 trillion in cuts from planned spending, $2 trillion would come from\" repealing the Obamacare insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion and replacing them with...well, nothing right now. \"The wholesale assault on efforts to provide lower income Americans with health insurance is the clearest sign that Republicans don't want to deal with inequality. The inability to get health insurance is one of the biggest burdens on low-income families, particularly those working for low wages and few or no benefits. Obamacare has helped 16.4 million Americans get health insurance. Where would they turn? And Republicans would compound the damage: The Senate proposes cutting an additional $400 billion from Medicaid over a decade, the House more than double that. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that on other low-income programs, the Senate budget cuts even more than the House. The vagueness of these plans makes it hard to tally how much damage would be done to food stamps, Pell Grants for low-income college students and the like, but Greenstein estimates that about two-thirds of the cuts in both plans come\" from programs for the less fortunate, thereby exacerbating poverty and inequality. \"Greenstein concludes that under such proposals-here's hoping President Obama is relentless in blocking them -\" ours would be a coarser and less humane nation with higher levels of poverty and inequality, less opportunity, \"and an\" inadequately prepared \"workforce. Another bit of hypocrisy: These budget writers care so much about national security that they're not willing to raise a dime in taxes to cover their sharp increases in defense spending. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, called out his conservative colleagues for how differently they treat defense and social spending .\" You're always telling us the deficit is so bad we've got to cut programs for the elderly, for the sick and for the poor, \"Sanders said,\" and suddenly, all of that rhetoric disappears. \"Budgets are, by their nature, boring. That's why those who assemble these long columns of numbers figure they can assail the well-being of the least privileged people in our society even as they profess to care about them so much. I'd respect these folks a lot more if they said what they clearly believe: They think more inequality would be good for us. It almost makes you nostalgic for the candor of the Romney who spoke about the\" 47 percent \"and the <mark>Paul Ryan</mark> who once divided us between\" makers \"and\" takers. \"Honesty beats saccharine words about the struggles of working people any day.
