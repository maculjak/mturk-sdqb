travel further to register their weddings and deaths, if proposed registry office closures go ahead. as part of its cost cutting measures to save? 125million, lincolnshire county council is considering the closure of five registry offices across the county. currently, lincolnshire registry offices achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, but a report by the executive director of resources and community safety, <mark>pete moore</mark>, raises concerns about how the closures could affect this. the report states: \"there may be a risk of reduced customer satisfaction, negative feedback and the loss of staff morale, which may compromise the customer service excellence accreditation .\" further risks highlighted in the report focus on the foreseen loss of income for bridal shops and florists in affected towns if ceremonies are moved elsewhere. owner of bridal elegance on market street, spilsby, patricia fry, said: \"it will affect the business because we are the only bridal shop in spilsby and i don't really understand why they are closing it and horncastle .\" the white hart now has a license but it would not be everybody's choice and a lot of people don't have the transport to get to skegness or louth. \"the report also highlights the requirement for customers to travel increased distances to alternative offices as a potential concern. to ensure skegness registry is able to cope with more customers, the council has stated its commitment to providing better facilities there, which\" would prove very attractive to local residents and support local tourism by facilitating ceremonies for holidaymakers'. spilsby registry offices, along with those in bourne, market rasen, horncastle and long sutton, have been selected for the cuts due to their low usage and poor cost effectiveness. the registry opens less than eight hours a week and conducts a low volume of ceremonies but could provide a significant capital return to the council if and when it is sold. lcc leader coun <mark>martin hill</mark> said: \"with very much reduced budgets, all councils are having to look at how they can provide services more efficiently whilst still meeting their statutory obligations .\" to this end, a review has been undertaken of all registration offices to make sure they are efficient and providing a value-for-money quality service to the public. \"\"following this review. recommendations have been put forward to consider changes at registration offices that are currently only open a few hours a week where the costs to run them is more than any income they generate. proposals will be consulted on extensively before any final decisions are made .\" temperature: 10 c to 20 c wind speed: 30 mph this website and its associated newspaper

creditworthy in eyes of global financial markets despite s & p downgrade by matthew lee associated press washington (ap) - the obama administration on wednesday expressed concern about a \"creeping\" trend of anti-american sentiment in egypt, where it says it has noticed mounting attacks and criticism of u.s. aid and motives as the country transitions to democracy. the state department said it has raised the matter with egyptian officials. it complained that the criticism is \"inaccurate\" and \"unfair\" and that personal attacks lodged against anne patterson, the new u.s. ambassador to egypt, are \"unacceptable .\" \"with regard to this kind of anti-americanism that's creeping into the egyptian public discourse, we are concerned,\" department spokeswoman victoria nuland told reporters. \"we've expressed these concerns to the egyptian government. we think this kind of representation of the united states is not only inaccurate; it's unfair. we are very strong supporters of egypt's transition to a democratic future, and we will continue to be there for egypt .\" nuland said patterson \"is one of our finest, most respected, most experienced ambassadors around the world. and she is in egypt to represent u.s. policy and the american people's aspiration to support a strong, democratic, prosperous egypt .\" u.s. officials said secretary of state hillary rodham clinton raised the matter with egypt's new intelligence chief, maj. gen. murad muwafi, in a july 28 meeting in washington. however, the trend has continued with some accusing washington of interference and fanning instability since the ouster earlier this year of authoritarian president hosni mubarak, a longtime u.s. ally. during a july visit to washington, maj. gen. mohammed al-assar, a member of the supreme council of the armed forces, criticized the united states for funding pro-democracy groups away from egyptian government supervision. at a conference hosted by the u.s. institute of peace, al-assar said that some countries including the united states have violated the egyptian laws in their funding egyptian ngos and said that egyptians were opposed to \"foreign interference,\" according to a statement by usip posted on its website. he added, \"it is a matter of sovereignty .\" hours earlier on the same day, he met with a number of scholars at the headquarters of the egyptian consulate. he reiterated same notion and said, \"all foreign funding should be subject to scrutiny in egypt .\" the july 31 issue of a state-run magazine featured a cover depicting patterson as holding a burning wad of dollars to the wick of a bomb wrapped in an american flag. the headline read: \"the ambassador from hell who lit a fire in tahrir,\" a reference to cairo's tahrir square, which was the epicenter of the uprising that toppled mubarak in february. earlier this week, egypt's prestigious state-run daily al-ahram quoted a senior member of the muslim brotherhood, abdel rahman salem, as saying patterson \"has an anti-islamic history and her role is to spread chaos in egypt .\" he referred to patterson's previous post in pakistan and claimed that she \"has relations with cia .\" \"she will work on dismantling the egyptian society just as she did in pakistan,\" he was quoted as saying. he criticized her previous remarks about the us aid to ngos to promote democracy and said, \"it doesn't serve the revolution goals in egypt .\" the administration has been surprised by a rise in anti-american sentiment in the mideast, particularly in egypt where president barack obama delivered a 2009 speech intended to ease tensions between the united states and the arab and muslim world. la stadium study appears to overstate tax benefits ex-executive charged in ny with insider trading la

baker 21 292-1,628 5.6 14 east lansing - sorry, fans, but the next episode of \"spartandawg tv\" likely won't happen until after the 2011 football season. by then, larry caper and le \"veon bell will have decided a fierce battle for carries that accelerates today when michigan state camp goes full pads for the first time. no matter the result, they'll be right next to each other in front of a webcam, talking sports and pet peeves and laughing it up for the youtube\" show \"they devised in may. and they'll still be tight with edwin baker. these are three starting-quality players at what is arguably msu's most stacked position, but that apparently hasn't caused a strain .\" at the end of the day, we all want to win, \"said bell, a sophomore who along with caper is chasing baker, even though coach mark dantonio said he views them as\" three no. 1 running backs. \"\"there can become animosity and that type of thing,\" msu running backs coach brad salem said of situations like this. \"the thing is, they're very good people. and they understand the concept of team .\" hey, they all want 30, 35 carries and they should. they're competitive, they're running backs, they want the ball in their hands when the game's on the line. but that's what's making us better. in game 12 (last season) we had three healthy running backs. in a sense, guys take shots off each other because they don't have to carry it 30 times a game, four games in a row. could they? absolutely. \"some would say baker should get that kind of work, after a breakout sophomore season in 2010 that earned him all-big ten first team honors. he carried 207 times (16 times per game) for 1,201 yards and 13 touchdowns, averaging 5.8 yards a carry .\" when you look at edwin and his ability to explode and all the sudden hit a big home run for you, that's rare in today's college football, to see guys run the length of the field like he's done on a number of occasions, \"msu first-year offensive coordinator dan roushar said of the 5-foot-9, 210-pound baker. but that's not all there is to this. caper (5-11, 223) and bell (6-2, 237) are bigger and better in some areas .\" you have in larry and le \"veon guys that have tremendous ball skills, tremendous football iqs,\" roushar said. \"they can pick up blitzes from the other side. they do some things that, if you're not aware of it, it's happening and as coaches we see it. and it's like,\" wow, this is tremendous .' so they've got great competition. \"one year ago, caper was the no. 1 back after leading msu in rushing as a freshman in 2009. but he broke his hand in camp, missed the first two games, watched as baker and bell started the season on fire, and ended up with just 38 carries for 144 yards .\" you learn from everything, if it's a peak or a valley, \"said caper, who lives with baker .\" i had a valley last year. and i learned from it. as a man i learned from it. as a player i learned from it, and i'm a better individual for it. \"and he's 100 percent healthy. so is bell, after hurting both shoulders during the season and keeping quiet about it until after the season. it certainly affected his play. he had 549 rushing yards and eight touchdowns in the first six games - then just 56 yards with no scores in the final seven games. the seventh game, a win over illinois, saw bell hurt his left shoulder on an awkward fall to the ground. caper and bell look fit and explosive in camp, and talented redshirt freshman <mark>nick hill</mark> is now in the mix as well. but the reality of the situation is that baker is one of the big ten's most proven backs and the opportunities behind him may be limited. msu football: get to know new spartan snapper moore, then forget him candlelight march in memory of lansing teen killed by

program friday, calling the program to give parents in the state's wealthiest county checks for tuition at religious schools a \"substantial disservice to the public interest .\" denver district judge michael martinez sided with a group of parents, the american civil liberties union of colorado and the group americans united for separation of church and state. they asked for an injunction blocking the \"choice scholarship pilot program\" in douglas county. the voucher opponents argued the program violates the separation of church and state because it gives taxpayer money to parents for use at approved private schools, including some religious schools. the judge noted that some of the schools authorized for douglas vouchers require students to attend religious services. martinez said the voucher program \"violates both financial and religious provisions set forth in the colorado constitution .\" school-choice advocates vowed to appeal. more than 200 students have already gotten voucher money from the county to use this fall. one of the private schools in the program starts monday, and it wasn't immediately clear whether any of the checks had been cashed. a message for the school district spokesman was not immediately returned friday afternoon. the u.s. supreme court has given its backing to voucher programs, ruling they don't violate the u.s. constitution. but courts in several states have overturned voucher laws because they went further toward supporting religious institutions than their state constitutions allowed. a new voucher program covering the entire state of indiana is similar to the one in colorado and is under legal challenge that state. an indianapolis judge has said he'll decide next week whether to issue an injunction in that state. a spokeswoman for the aclu of colorado said the plaintiffs in the douglas case don't oppose religious schools, but objected to taxpayer money being used. douglas county officials argued that because the scholarship checks went to parents, who would then choose their child's school, the county wasn't improperly sponsoring religion. plaintiffs insisted the parent pass-through was a ploy to get around the constitution. \"the court correctly recognized that it's unconstitutional for the state to subsidize the religious education of a child,\" aclu spokeswoman <mark>rosemary harris</mark> lytle said. a lawyer for parents expecting vouchers said they were distraught by the ruling but hoping for a quick reversal. \"we'll be moving as quickly as possible to try to get this program back in place for this school year,\" said michael bindas of the school-choice group institute for justice. douglas school officials approved the voucher program last spring, and some parents have already gotten scholarship checks. hundreds more are on a waiting list. one of the parents testified near tears last week at the injunction hearing that her son has a form of autism and she wouldn't be able to send her son to the proper school without the voucher money. highlands ranch mom diana oakley said her son can't get the necessary education at the county schools. \"inside those four walls, he doesn't fit,\" oakley said. martinez conceded that voucher recipients would be hurt by the injunction, which he said \"will undoubtedly result in significant hardships for the families already selected .\" but martinez concluded that constitutional concerns outweigh the hardships and that it was \"clear and certain\" plaintiffs would prevail in their legal challenge.", "articleID":

its members not to \"linger in the past'. sandakan: the liberal democratic party (ldp) has laid claim to the six seats left vacant by sabah progressive party (sapp) who left barisan nasional (bn) in september 2008. the six seats comprise two parliamentary seats - tawau and sepangar - and the state constituencies of luyang, likas, elopura, and tanjung papat. ldp president vk liew made the claim for the six while officiating the annual general meeting for its six divisions in sandakan yesterday .\" it goes without saying that ldp will continue to contest in the four seats we contested in 2008, namely (the) sandakan parliamentary (seat) and the three state seats - karamunting, merotai and tanjung kapor. \"these seats are non-negotiable. on the other six seats left vacant by sapp who left bn in september 2008, we will no doubt be the only eligible local based party to lay claim to these six seats,\" he said. noting that the agm was probably the last before the 13th general election, he stressed that it was important for the party to be ready not only in its preparation but also in dealing with the other component parties in bn. \"we must first ensure unity within our party and at the same time ensure unity within bn .\" it is important for us to be united together to fight the opposition? a win for bn is a win for ldp. \"we must therefore ensure bn wins .\" it is important for us to produce quality winnable candidates in all the seats we will be contesting and show their qualities and abilities to serve the people without fear and favor. \"no point to be popular in the party and (be) able to win in party election but get rejected by the people in an election,\" said liew who the sandakan mp and a deputy minister in the pm's department. liew stressed that ldp must not fight yesterday's war as it is already over. \"our battle is tomorrow and to fight it, we must be prepared today. ldp must not linger on in the past .\" while we can use the past as a guide, we must be prepared today using today's strategies for tomorrow's battle. \"the battle field has now changed and the mindset of the people is also changing,\" he said. liew, who is also chairman of elopura ldp division, also took the opportunity to take a swipe at those who had quit the party to join rival bn parties for positions in government. \"many of you have been with ldp for the last 21 years. your loyalty has made me very proud and an envy of many others .\" despite recent attempt by someone, who left the party for his own personal glory just to hold on to his ministerial position, to entice our sandakan members with promises and financial gains, many of you were not moved by such tactics. \"a member even told me that the person even called him to ask him and a group of them to leave with lots of financial promises but instead he together with many others scolded that minister for being a traitor and slammed down the phone .\" this is the spirit of ldp that i together with the entire ldp are very proud of. \"you are the true heroes and heroines of ldp .\" though he did not name the \"minister', it is understood that liew was referring to former ldp
