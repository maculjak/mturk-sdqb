of the few english speakers who is left at the hospital...and as per normal, it just triggered the anger in me. hello, my name is geraint isitt and i have a problem with censorship. i just don't like being told what i can read or listen to, and even worse, write. in order for my writing to be as strong as possible, to emit the emotions in others that i want, i need to know that i have used the best words possible for piece. usually, this means offending someone. by placing limitations on what i can write, whether it be an individual word, a sentence, or a whole genre, you are crippling the creative spirit that i need to become a better writer. i write because i love it, but also because it gives me the freedom to dare, to try things i normally wouldn't. through my writing i can accomplish anything. i can climb everest, i can have that moment that lasts forever, i can be the lone gunman sitting in a coffee shop waiting to commit my seventh shooting of the summer. hell, i can even speak a single sentence and not stutter. do i want to do all of this in real life? no, of course not. but that is where the issue of censorship gets cloudy. too many people take things too literally and blame what they read or hear on things that go wrong. somewhere along the lines we lost touch with reality, started taking things too personally, and found it acceptable behavior to complain, bitch and moan about anything and everything. and god forbid if anything goes wrong and it can be traced, in some way, to a piece of literature or pop culture. exactly where those lines started to blur i could not tell you; but it was a long time ago. in a day and age when kids can sever heads of victims on their video games, i find it hard to believe that we are still considering banning books because of content. quite frankly, it's not like most kids spend too much time reading anyway. and i think we censor to appease the weak and dumb, the not-so-in-touch with reality that, unfortunately, make up too much of our society and too many of the rules. i'm no genius, but i'm not an idiot either, and i can tell the difference between a work of fiction and reality. reality is more painful. how many of you have heard of mark twain? that's what i thought. twain is often regarded as one of america's finest writers, yet, one of his books, the adventures of <mark>tom sawyer</mark> and huckleberry finn was in a constant state of should it be banned or not in many us schools. and the furor was over one word: a racial slur. one of twain's characters was named nigger jim. i don't use this word in everyday conversation, okay, i don't use the word at all, but i feel safe enough with the readership on this website to understand that i am in no ways meaning this in a derogatory or offensive way to anyone. unfortunately, too many people complained about it, successfully having it banned from schools. it mattered not that when twain wrote the book, that term was in wide use, and unfortunately, pretty commonplace. and it mattered not that jim turned out to be the most honest character in the book. you can't appease everyone i guess. and let us not forget about the controversy surrounding j.d. sallinger's novel, catcher in the rye. i loved this book, as did many others, including a gentleman named mark david chapman, who, apparently, was reading this book the day he shot <mark>john lennon</mark>. the book was subsequently banned; something to do with the messages chapman took from the book. maybe i didn't read the book closely enough, but i don't remember a paragraph that said\" get a gun and shoot, arguably, the most talented member of one of the world's greatest bands \". maybe that line only appeared in one copy? and even if it did, i wouldn't do it. we can't succumb to the pressure and start censoring and banning just because people\" say \"something was the reason they did something wrong. i hate to break it to you people in the know, but it takes a little bit more than that. something is fumbling around in the old cranial passages of these people. but, hey, let's not address the health problems of our society; let's limit what we want our writers to put out. and forgive me for saying it, but does anyone else not have a problem with people killing themselves when they hear these secret messages on albums? don't get me wrong, death, in any form, is a tragedy. and i'm not condoning suicide. but i'm not one of those people who sit around and think that it is a total waste of a life either. as far as i'm concerned, the bottom feeders are the ones that leave this way. i've had three friends commit suicide, none for the reason of\" subliminal messages \"in a black sabbath song, and i've wept for the three of them. but, i also thought their actions were cowardly. sure, their pain and suffering is over, but in each instance, the wife/girlfriend, and family members suffer much longer. one of them was the biggest fan of heavy metal music i know, but i know why he did what he did and it had nothing to do with what he read or heard. if that was the reason, i wouldn't have wept. maybe i'm heartless. maybe i'm just upset because the unintelligent and the scared get to make the rules. writing, by nature, is meant to stir emotions. writing, by nature, is meant to leave you wanting more, or wanting to take a cold shower, or wanting to hug a loved one and feel safe again. writing is not meant to be as numbingly benign as talk shows and reality television. i want to be the next margaret atwood or bret easton ellis. i want to be the one pushing boundaries on what is acceptable fiction. when i write i write to entertain. and i also write to get people thinking - intelligent, rational people. unfortunately, most days, it seems like there are too few of us left. and, on a final note, did anyone else find it funny a few years back when a group of modern day\" witches \"wanted to ban"},

local companies and people who keep capitalism moving. it's your exclusive tip sheet on deals, squabbles and the whimsy that makes this region's industries interesting. cree to add 575 jobs by 2012, plans durham expansion cree, the maker of energy-efficient led lights, announced a new surge of hiring that will swell the company's ranks by 575 workers in the state. in a staged event at its durham headquarters this afternoon that included gov. bev perdue, cree ceo chuck swoboda said the company expects to fill 275 of those jobs this year and fill the remaining 300 openings by the end of 2012. the expansion will significantly boost cree's local staff of 1,500 as the company rides the green energy wave. \"we are seeing tremendous growth for led lighting,\" swoboda said, in a prepared statement. \"energy-efficient lighting has its roots right here in north carolina and cree is proud to be bringing more green jobs to our state .\" in august, cree also began making and assembling led lights in charlotte with contract manufacturer flextronics. cree's is the second major local jobs announcement this week, on the heels of parachute maker north american aerodynamics' plans to hire 375 people in roxboro to fill a u.s. army contract. but the good news was overshadowed by computer maker dell's news wednesday that it will shut down its plant in winston-salem and idle 905 workers. cree is one of the most successful homegrown businesses the triangle has ever spawned, an outgrowth of a n.c. state university research project that that is now traded on the nasdaq stock market. originally cree developed early-generation light emitting diodes for mobile phones, car dashboards and computer monitors. but rapid advancements in semiconductor technology are pushing leds to new applications in lighting for streetlights, offices, homes, hotels and restaurants. led lights can last more than two decades and are sometimes referred to as semi-permanent fixtures. at the same time, leds are up to 90 percent more efficient than conventional lights. as the price of leds comes down and quality improves, leds are increasingly seen as the future of electric lighting that will eventually render incandescent bulbs obsolete. the recent national push for energy-efficiency coincides with quality improvements that together are creating new demand for leds in a wide range of uses. raleigh is among the cities that's testing leds in streetlights and parking decks. as one of the world's top led manufacturers, cree is poised to get a major boost from the transition to efficient lighting. \"business is very good for cree and they're struggling to add capacity,\" said <mark>harsh kumar</mark>, an analyst who follows the company's stock with morgan keegan & co. \"as the federal stimulus money is kicking in, as the population is becoming more green, led lighting is a very compelling product .\" last month, cree sold nearly $400 million worth of new shares on wall street, with about $150 million earmarked for expansion. assistant business editor alan m. wolf joined the n & o in 1999 covering the business of health care. he became an editor in 2001, and helps

pastures: mainstream pop By Steven J.

Jacket by JET available at John Eshaya. Left: Tegan: Shirt by Rag & Bone. Forging a career that transgresses the boundaries of alternative rock and dives into infectious pop is new ground for Tegan and Sara. Often pegged to their labels--lesbians, identical twins, Canadian--the duo have spent nearly 20 years eclipsing what's on the surface by focusing on their sound and message, gradually progressing from bedroom four-trackers to moody indie blowouts to their most ambitious incarnation yet: candy-striped, \u201980s - indebted, queer-leaning New Wave that, instead of fetishizing sexuality, normalizes it. On their eighth album, Love You to Death, the duo take the rocky experiences from real-life relationships and send them up the flagpole in the hopes of finally cracking the mainstream. Though they're the most prominent contemporary gay female act to scale the charts (their 2013 album, Heartthrob, debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200), the 35-year-old songwriters have still spent most of their career as outsiders. But proud ones. Female artists such as Lady Gaga, Halsey, and Nicki Minaj have bent the spectrum of sexuality in pop culture but limited it to just one facet of their public persona. Tegan and Sara Quin have become torchbearers forpost -' 00s queerdom in music. Where the Calgary, Alberta, natives have excelled is in their readiness to take anecdotes from their personal lives and push them to the forefront, something they've done since signing to <mark>Neil Young</mark>'s Vapor Records in 1999. \"A lot of our career, it felt really natural to be open about the fact that I was queer,\" says Sara. \"I don't have to think very hard about relating to a song about a straight man. I don't understand why the world can't relate to a song written by a queer woman. I'm writing about the same shit everyone is writing about. I just happen to be a girl who identifies as queer .\" With Love You to Death, out June 3 on Vapor/Warner Bros., their openness takes on added dimensions. Having invited superproducer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Sia) to partake in the recording process for the whole album--a first for the pair--they tackle a complex kaleidoscope of relationships, particularly the one they share as twins. Until now they've been relatively private about the friction between them, which nearly tore the duo apart around the release of 2007's The Con (their fifth album and first to chart) and led to literal blows and long stretches when they wouldn't speak to each other. \"I think Sara and I spent a lot of years compromising, and I think that fueled a lot of the anger and resentment and frustration and isolation that we experienced in our band,\" says Tegan. The song on Love that addresses the ripples in their sisterhood most explicitly is \"100x,\" a stark piano ballad written by Sara: \"It was cruel of me to do what I did to you / It was wrong of me to hurt such a big part of you,\" they harmonize. Pants by Veronica Beard available at Saks Fifth Avenue. Jacket available at Church Boutique LA.. Sara: Shirt by Rag & Bone. Pants by Sandro available at Bloomingdale's. Jacket by Mossimo for Target. \"We are doing much better, but old habits die hard,\" says Sara. They went to therapy at one point and are finally at a place where they can listen to each other before reacting. \"There are days where I imagine opening the car door and pushing Tegan out, but I just think to myself, We're 35 and grown-ups, and we've acquired skills, in our personal and romantic relationships as well as our professional relationships. Now that we've put that era behind us, I think it's actually quite healing to talk about it .\" Their improved communication has also freed them to focus more on staking uncharted sonic territory. Just two albums ago, with 2009's Sainthood, they inhabited a space in alternative music where people often crassly exoticized their otherness: \"People asked us if we were incestuous,\" recalls Sara. With that record's follow-up, Heartthrob, they kept their approach to lyricism the same but shifted the tone, working mostly with Kurstin to tighten its pop structures and fold in synthetic sounds. On Love they're making a bid for a bigger fan base, something they've been edging toward for years. \"We deserve to be there,\" says Tegan. \"We're working just as hard as everybody else, and I want to blow that fuckin' door open, just like so many artists before us did .\" Many have already embraced them. In 2014 they opened for Katy Perry on her Prismatic tour, and last year they performed their song \"Everything Is Awesome\" (from The Lego Movie) at the Academy Awards with Andy Samberg's band, the Lonely Island, and Questlove. Their hummable, Windex-wiped new single \"Boyfriend\" is about dating a woman who's never been with another woman, inspired by the beginning of Sara's romance with her current girlfriend--and it's just as capable of being slotted into a radio playlist as anything from Taylor Swift. While queer male pop stars like <mark>Sam Smith</mark>, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years's Olly Alexander have seamlessly won over large swaths of pop fans with their confessional same-sex love songs, Tegan and Sara are hoping to level the playing field and do the same. \"If Katy Perry can open the door for artists like us, then we can open the door for some of those <mark>young</mark> kids to start to think about their gender and their sexuality,\" says Tegan. \"That feels really important .\" Tegan and Sara will release their new album, Love You to Death, on June 8.

(@ UKinPeru) March 18, 2020 The embassy posted a message stating that Colombian airline Avianca was considering operating a charter flight from Lima to London this weekend, but warned that tickets for the one-way trip were \"likely\" to cost between 3,000 and 3,500 US dollars (\u00a3 2,600 to \u00a3 3,000). Tourists in Morocco face a race against time to get home as the country is closing its airspace after Thursday. Bob Warburton, 62, from Manchester, told the PA news agency that the situation at Agadir airport was \"chaos\" , with hundreds of UK holidaymakers waiting for flights. He explained that he and his wife were unable to contact Ryanair, who they were booked to fly back with, and described the airline as \"appalling and negligent\". The pair eventually paid a \u00a3 100 taxi fare to travel to Marrakech airport, where they were able to book themselves onto a flight. <mark>Thomas Reilly</mark>, the British ambassador to Morocco, said: \"It is chaotic. There is no way that evacuating over 85,000 people in less than a week was ever going to be anything other than chaotic .\" I am sorry. It is not just the UK which is bringing its citizens home. Every other nation is trying to as well. We are all doing our best. \"Grant Gibson, 65, from Lyminge, Kent, is stuck with his wife in Northern Cyprus, where a state of emergency has been declared.

Mr Raab told the committee the Government was asking airlines to operate flights on routes they did not normally serve, which \"takes some configuring\". He said any spare seats on rescue flights would be offered to other countries trying to bring their citizens home. He explained: \"We also want to be able to pick up the phone and say\" By the way, if you have any spare room can you help get the Brits out?' \"0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2019121515_00194534_W", "names": {"Sam Bishop": ["Q10387701", "Q11305227"]}, "date": "2019-11-21", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/age-of-empires-iv-on-consoles-isnt-a-definite-no/?sid=3faa201744c825825ab21a08306c2896#comments", "content": "Age of Empires IV Age of Empires IV on consoles isn't a definite no Microsoft's Shannon Loftis and Adam Isgreen both said that PC was the main focus, but we may still see it on consoles. 2019-11-21 16:00 <mark>Sam Bishop</mark> The majority of Age of Empires players will be used to experiencing strategy games like this on the PC, but when Stevivor spoke with Microsoft's Shannon Loftis and Adam Isgreen at X019 last week, they didn't rule out the possibility of console gamers getting Age of Empires IV. \"It's hard, as a PC game,\" Loftis said. \"We want to make it great on PC.

Olympic bronze medallist <mark>Walsh</mark> placed second with an impressive 21.97 m while compatriot Jacko Gill was eighth in a 10-man field with his 20.70 m effort. <mark>Walsh</mark> was happy with his best distance of the year by 17cm, achieved with his opening throw, as he builds towards the world championships in London in August. It was just 24cm short of his personal best and 26cm longer than his previous Diamond League meet effort in May, when he was also beaten by Crouser at the Prefontaine Classic in Oregon. <mark>Walsh</mark> admits Olympic champion Crouser is throwing at a different level after the American won on Thursday with a 22.39 m heave. Four of his throws were better than the Kiwi's best effort. \"I train a lot with Ryan and he almost always is ahead of me,\" <mark>Walsh</mark> said. \"I need to turn the table at some point in time. Who knows? I may do that at the biggest stage .\" Former world junior champion Gill wasn't at his best, having achieved a career-best 21.01 m in January, which was enough to qualify for the world championships. Gill saved his best distance until last after failing to better 20.36 m through his first five throws.
