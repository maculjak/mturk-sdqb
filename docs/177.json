remain committed to the war in afghanistan, according to u.s. and alliance officials, but there are growing signs that the afghan political and military hostilities against the coalition are starting to wear on the coalition. defense secretary leon panetta and other u.s. officials heading to the meetings say they expect to reassure allies that military commanders are doing all they can to stem the tide of insider attacks, in which afghan troops or insurgents dressed in their uniforms turn their guns on the coalition forces that they are training and fighting alongside. compounding those military threats, however, is a recent spike in political tensions between afghanistan's government leaders and the u.s. afghan president hamid karzai complained that the war effort is wrongheaded, and that coalition forces are not fighting the right enemy. just days ahead of the nato meeting, panetta was uncharacteristically sharp, criticizing karzai for complaining rather than thanking the troops who have sacrificed their lives for his country. karzai's argument that nato is wrongly going after the taliban in afghanistan when it should be fighting insurgents in pakistan's safe havens could further erode support for the war, particularly among members of congress. panetta's pique reflects the frustration of his military commanders, who have seen more than 2,000 u.s. troops die in the 11-year war. and it can only fuel the increasingly strident grumbling by american lawmakers who are facing hotly contested elections next month, and are hearing from constituents wondering why the u.s. is pouring billions of dollars into a fight that afghanistan's shaky and corruption-plagued government may no longer support. still, panetta and allied leaders, including nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen, insist that the war strategy and the timeline remain firm. they say the coalition will stick to the withdrawal schedule, which has combat forces leaving and afghan forces taking over security of the country by the end of 2014. panetta told reporters traveling with him that the ministers will discuss the progress that has been made since they met for a summit in chicago earlier this year. \"i'll also reassure allies of our strong commitment to finishing the job in afghanistan alongside our allies,\" he said. defense ministers on wednesday will also hear from marine gen. <mark>john allen</mark>, the top u.s. commander in afghanistan, who will discuss measures the military has taken to reduce the insider attacks. the attacks, which have killed more than 53 coalition troops this year, have imperiled the strategy by eating away at the trust between the allied forces and the afghans they were sent there to mentor and train. \"my goal is to make clear to nato and to our allies that we are taking all steps necessary to confront this issue and that it should not be allowed to deter us from the plan that gen. <mark>allen</mark> put in place,\" said panetta. with support for the war ebbing across america and much of the world, there have been growing calls for a speedier withdrawal. watch: roundtable ii: this week in politics watch: roundtable i:

seems to think he's got the golden plan that will help his fighter manny pacquiao (54-4-2, 38 ko's) finally conclusively beat 39-year-old juan manuel marquez (54-6-1, 39 ko's) after having failed to establish that he's the better guy in their three previous fights together. roach thinks that all pacquiao has to do to beat marquez this time is to use movement. roach said to maxboxing.com \"we've got to really, really get back to that perpetual motion that we had in the first fight .\" if pacquiao is able to hop around like he used to be able to do then roach thinks this will be enough for him to defeat the 39-year-old marquez. roach has noticed that since pacquiao lost his ability to move like he did years ago, he's taking a lot more punishment - and getting beaten. whether roach wants to admit it or not, pacquiao should have two straight losses going into the fourth pacquiao-marquez fight on december 8th at the mgm grand in las vegas, nevada. i don't the movement is the answer for pacquiao, because even when he was able to move really well in his first fight with marquez in 2004, he was still dominated from the 2nd round on in that fight. smart fighters are easily able to handle guys that move by timing them for when they do come in and make an attack. the fighter that is doing all the moving is really hurting himself by wearing himself out with all the extra effort.

found guilty of such acts from rs 2,000 to a minimum of rs 50,000 going up to rs 1 lakh for the first conviction. in case of repeat of the offence, the imprisonment may extend to seven years and a fine between rs 1 lakh and rs 5 lakh for second conviction. police officers not below the rank of inspectors are authorised to carry out search and seizure, in addition to state and central government officers authorised by the state or central government, it said. these amendments seek to ensure that more effective protection is provided against indecent representation of women by covering newer
