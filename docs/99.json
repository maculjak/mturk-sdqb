currents visible is a common practice in the study of fluid mechanics. the approach was adopted and perfected by artist paul matisse in sculptures he calls kalliroscopes. matisse's glass-enclosed liquid sculptures contain an object whose movement through the liquid creates whorls that can be seen only because elongated particles trailing the object align with the direction of the current; light reflects off the particles, making the current visible to the viewer. researchers at mit recently demonstrated that this same phenomenon is responsible for the swirling patterns scientists typically see when they agitate a flask containing microbes in water; many microbes are themselves elongated particles that make the whorls visible. more importantly, they say this phenomenon occurs in the ocean when elongated microbes caught in a current align horizontally with the ocean surface, affecting how much light goes into the ocean and how much bounces off as backscatter. because many ocean microbes, like large phytoplankton, have either an elongated shape or live in communities of long chains, this orientation to ocean currents could have a substantial effect on ocean light - which in turn influences photosynthesis and phytoplankton growth rates - as well as on satellite readings of light backscatter used to inform climate models or assess algal blooms. in a quiescent ocean, phytoplankton are randomly oriented and light filters through easily. this random arrangement is usually assumed in models of light propagation in the ocean and in satellite readings. but fluid flow can change things. \"even small shear rates can increase backscattering from blooms of large phytoplankton by more than 30 percent,\" said roman stocker, professor of civil and environmental engineering at mit and lead author on a paper about this work. \"this implies that fluid flow, which is typically neglected in models of marine optics, may exert an important control on light propagation, influencing the rates of carbon fixation and how we estimate these rates via remote sensing .\" another consideration is microbial size. very small microbes (less than 1 micrometer in diameter) don't align with the ocean current no matter what their shape. \"these very small things don't align because they are too vigorously kicked around by water molecules in an effect called brownian motion,\" said stocker, who studies the biomechanics of the movements of ocean microbes, often in his own micro-version of a kalliroscope called microfluidics. he recreates an ocean environment in microfluidic devices about the size of a stick of gum and uses videomicroscopy to trace and record the microbes' movements in response to food and current. in this case, however, the research methodology was observation, followed by mathematical modeling (much of which was handled by graduate student marcos, who created a model that coupled fluid mechanics with optics), and subsequent experimentation carried out by graduate students mitul luhar and william durham using a tabletop-sized device. but the impetus for the research was an observation of swirling microbes in a flask of water and a question posed by justin seymour, a former postdoctoral fellow at mit. \"justin walked up to me with a flask of microbes in water, shook it, and asked me what the swirls were,\" said stocker. \"now we know .\" in addition to seymour, who is now a research fellow at the university of technology sydney, other co-authors on the paper are marcos, luhar and durham; professor <mark>james mitchell</mark> of flinders university in adelaide, australia; and professor andreas macke of the leibniz institute for tropospheric research in germany. next steps: the researchers plan to test this mechanism in the field in a local environment suitable for experimentation, most likely a nearby lake. ###funding: funding was provided by grants from the national science foundation and

rights floodgates the first image rights case tested by hmrc before the tax special commissioners was in april 2000 and involved payments made by arsenal to <mark>david platt</mark> and dennis bergkamp. until recently, few people thought of tax when thinking of football. however, nowadays few weeks pass media scrutiny of some club or player in a tangle with the taxman. although some of this increased publicity results from hmrc's policy of \"publically shaming' errant taxpayers, there is no doubt that football is now big business and the taxman is anxious to ensure that he gets his fair share. recently, press attention has focussed on the use of image rights by top footballers to\" dodge millions in tax' and how hmrc is said to be negotiating a payment of uk? 100m from premier league clubs to make good the tax owing. - so, how much of this is true, and how much is media sensationalism? \"despite recent publicity, clubs have been making payments for use of players' images for at least ten years\" first of all, it's worth pointing out that, despite recent publicity, clubs have been making payments for use of players' images for at least ten years. the first case tested by hmrc before the tax special commissioners was in april 2000 and involved payments made by arsenal to <mark>david platt</mark> and dennis bergkamp. hmrc claimed that the arrangements whereby arsenal made payments made to <mark>platt</mark> and bergkamp for use of their images, were simply a \"smokescreen' for paying them money offshore to avoid tax. hmrc asked the special commissioners to determine that the payments were effectively additional payments made to the players for playing football, which should have treated as earnings, i.e. subjected to income tax and nic via arsenal's payroll. the commissioners, however, decided that the payments were legitimately made in return for allowing arsenal to exploit the players' images, a purpose entirely different to playing football, for which they were paid a salary via the payroll. as a result the floodgates opened, and as the influx of foreign players into the british game increased, the use of image rights as part of players overall payment packages became much more common .\" typically, image rights payments may account for 15 to 20 per cent of a player's total remuneration package, and for genuine superstars even more \"the amounts at stake are substantial. in straightforward arrangements for british players, the differential between personal and company tax rates means that for each uk? 100,000 paid as image rights rather than salary, hmrc stands to lose up to uk? 36,000 in tax and nic. recently, more aggressive tax planning arrangements for british players may enable loans to be taken from image rights companies which may be made almost tax free. depending on the exact arrangements, it may even be possible to write off these loans later without attracting a further tax liability. if payments are made to offshore image rights companies, as is usually the case for foreign players, the losses can be considerably greater as no uk tax may be payable. typically, image rights payments may account for 15 to 20 per cent of a player's total remuneration package, and for genuine superstars even more. bearing in mind premier league earnings, it is easy to see how hmrc believes that multi-millions of pounds may be at stake. not for the lack of trying! over the past five to six years, almost all premier league clubs have come under review by hmrc. not unexpectedly few were ready to accept large hmrc claims to tax and nic in relation to image rights payments made, but instead engaged the services of leading tax advisers to fight their corners. hmrc maintained that in the vast majority of cases, the amounts paid were wildly in excess of the player's values, and/or that the paying clubs made little or no effort to exploit the images of the players they had paid to richly to obtain use of. clubs maintained the payments were reasonably valued, and not related to playing football. after several years of getting nowhere hmrc and the premier league decided to explore the possibility of a centrally negotiated agreement. discussions began in late 2009, with tentative initial ideas being that players' image values should be determined by international status, with different bandings depending upon factors such as the international country involved, and number of caps. however, these negotiations quickly fell over, largely because the bigger clubs maintained that the images of their star players were worth far more than hmrc's banding system envisaged. however, perhaps fuelled by the government's dash for cash, negotiations recommenced in late 2010; this time hmrc tried to band clubs by reference to turnover, with the percentage of image rights payments being treated as liable to tax and nic increasing as turnover decreased. the cynical may say that this was a blatant attempt to gain agreement from the bigger clubs who resisted previous proposals. the outcome of the clubs' vote on whether or not to accept hmrc's latest proposals is awaited. however, on previous history, it is perhaps unlikely that a consensus view will be achieved .? copyright 2010 sportspromedia ltd. all rights reserved. level 2, trans-world house, 100 city road, london, ec1y 2bp, united kingdom", "articleID":

like you're replacing the organ music completely. you're just adding to it. i don't think it has ruined the fundamental history of wrigley .\" catcher koyie hill, who preferred striding to home plate to led zeppelin, said a new sound system would make the recorded music more palatable. \"if they're going to (play) music on that speaker system they have now, i don't know what the point is .\" hill said. \"but if guys in the room like it and that's their thing, i'm all for it. when you're up at the plate, or on the mound, it's your turn. so take your turn. if you want music, you get music. i'm a
