Photo: Hugh Hamilton Teresa Palmer thriller lined up for a Sydney shoot While there was no word on funding for the Hollywood movie that has brought Robert Redford to Sydney - he is playing newcaster Dan Rather in James Vanderbilt's drama Truth opposite Cate Blanchett and Elisabeth Moss - the NSW government has backed another film with Hollywood connections. Former Fox Filmed Entertainment executive Bill Mechanic, who produced the Pierce Brosnan-William Hurt historical fantasy The Moon and The Sun in Melbourne earlier this year, is part of the high-profile team behind <mark>Paul Currie</mark>'s thriller 2.22. Due to start filming at Fox Studios in January, it centres on an air traffic controller who finds himself returning to New York's Grand Central Station at 2.22 pm every day - an event that threatens the life of the woman he loves. While the male lead is still to be confirmed, Teresa Palmer will star in the film once she finishes shooting the Nicholas Sparks romance The Choice. With Screen Australia backing 2.22 in August, the state government has now put up $600,000 for an expected spend of $8.1 million in NSW. Arts Minister Troy Grant describes it as \"a great example of how our entrepreneurial filmmakers are working on the world stage and partnering with international producers\". Hirschfelder has two shots at winning best feature film score Colin Firth in The Railway Man. Composer David Hirschfelder has been a regular award winner over the years for his scores for the likes of Shine, Elizabeth and Better Than Sex. And as he works on Russell Crowe's The Water Diviner, he has claimed two of the four nominations for best feature film score at the Screen Music Awards to be held next month. Nominated for The Railway Man and Healing, Hirschfelder is up against <mark>Christopher Gordon</mark> for Adoration and <mark>Christopher</mark> de Groot for the little-known thriller Sororal. But two other composers have done even better with six nominations each - Antony Partos, whose work includes Redfern Now, Rake and Fallout, and Cezary Skubiszewski, whose work includes Once My Mother, The Broken Shore and Serangoon Road. Held by the Australian Guild of Screen Composers with the Australasian Performing Right Association and the Australasian Copyright Owners Society, the awards will be held at Sydney's City Recital Hall on November 12. Advertisement Early Oscar buzz has only one Australian actor in contention With Charlie's Country selected as Australia's entry for the foreign-language category, the Oscars are back in the news. And it looks like the near certainty that at least one Australian actor will be nominated might not eventuate next year. In the 16 years since Geoffrey Rush won best actor for Shine, the country's actors have only missed out twice, with a remarkable 23 nominations for five wins. While there are still three months before the nominations are announced, The Hollywood Reporter has framed a list of the leading contenders. With no mention of Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Geoffrey Rush, Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman and other leading lights, only one Australian actor features - Mia Wasikowska is considered a long-shot for a best actress nomination for Tracks. For best actor, the only (tenuous) Australian connection is <mark>Jack O'Connell</mark> as a frontrunner for Unbroken, which was shot here. Two Australian editors who were both nominated five years ago are deep in the running again - two-time winner Kirk Baxter for Gone Girl and <mark>Lee Smith</mark> for Interstellar. And, deservedly, the Sydney-shot The Lego Movie is one of the favourites for best animated feature. Mia Wasikowksa in Tracks. Gone Girl arrives with a flourish at the box office On the back of strong reviews and the the popularity of the bestselling novel, Gone Girl zoomed to the top of the Australian box office on the weekend. Director David Fincher's follow-up to The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo took $4.7 million with a strong average of $11,700 per cinema. In a country where horror films often perform modestly, Annabelle also opened well with $1.9 million for an average of $11,500 per cinema. A prequel to The Conjuring, it continues an impressive run with low-budget horror for prolific Australian filmmaker James Wan, who broke through with Saw a decade ago. Wan was one of the producers of Annabelle after directing last year's hits The Conjuring and Insidious: Chapter 2. He has Fast & Furious 7 out next April. Social media popularity leads to surprising results at the US box office Ben Affleck in Gone Girl. The importance of social media in film marketing was shown at the US box office at the weekend, when Gone Girl and Annabelle surprisingly outperformed box office projections - both taking more than $US37 million at the top of the charts. According to Deadline Hollywood, tracking showed that Annabelle's trailers and promotional videos had 16.2 million YouTube views and the movie had 2.4 million Facebook posts and 2.8 million Tweets. More popular on older-skewing social media, Gone Girl had 9.2 million YouTube views, 30.1 million Facebook posts and 18.7 million Tweets. While Short Cuts will always encourage newspaper advertising, the value of a powerful trailer and promotional clips as part of a social media campaign has become increasingly important to a movie's release.

The deal will see the car company present Social Shorts, which Trewhella describes as a chance for \"emerging filmmakers to have their work seen, shared and acknowledged by film enthusists and industry\" through a web site linked to social media voting. The academy does not having a naming rights partner for the awards but isn't chasing one either. Instead, Trewhella says it's looking for a presenting rights partner. \"We'd like to keep the AACTA Awards clean but\" the AACTA Awards presented by X or Y' is a really great opportunity now that these strong mid-tier building blocks are put in place. \"Free concert of film scores to launch Melbourne Symphony Orchestra season 7th Heaven father <mark>Stephen Collins</mark> allegedly confesses to sex abuse The Bachelor's sham proposal: Why is Network Ten not the villain?
