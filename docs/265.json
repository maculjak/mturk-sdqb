The reigning Shanghai champion and former world No. 1 Djokovic drubbed Italian Fabio Fognini 6-3, 6-3, while the second-seeded, newly-crowned No. 1 Nadal beat Argentine Carlos Berlocq 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) on the hardcourts at Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena. The fifth-seeded 2010 Shanghai runner-up Federer succumbed to oft-injured former top-10 performer Gael Monfils, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, on Day 5. \"[It was] one of those matches that could have gone either way,\" said Federer. \"I think I was a little lucky in the second set to get back, to be quite honest. I played a solid tiebreak .\" I had chances early on in the third set I think to make something happen. He kind of recovered, then started to serve a bit better again towards the end of the third set, which made it difficult for me. It's a bit of an up and down performance for me. \"The struggling Federer, who hasn't reached a semifinal since mid-July, lost to a player outside the top 20 for the fifth time in his last six tournaments. Monfils is now 2-6 lifetime against the 32-year-old 17-time Grand Slam king Federer .\" It's a good win for me, \"said Monfils .\" I feel a bit sorry for him because I know he's running for London. But it's tennis. He's going to have more opportunity those weeks coming up. \"Other big upsets came when German <mark>Florian Mayer</mark> doused third-seeded Spaniard and 2011 Shanghai runner-up David Ferrer 6-4, 6-3 and 15th-seeded Spaniard Nicolas Almagro took out fourth-seeded Czech slugger Tomas Berdych 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Also on Thursday, sixth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro advanced via walkover when sixth-seeded Tommy Haas was unable to go because of a back injury, while seventh-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga topped 12th-seeded Japanese Kei Nishikori 7-6 (7-5), 6-0 and eighth-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka bested 10th - seeded Canadian Milos Raonic 7-6 (7-2), 6-4. Raonic was last week's Tokyo runner-up to del Potro and titled in Bangkok two weeks ago. Friday's quarterfinals in Shanghai will pit the Australian Open champion and U.S. Open and Wimbledon runner-up Djokovic against Monfils, the 2009 Shanghai runner-up Nadal versus Wawrinka, the former U.S. Open champion del Potro against Almagro, and Tsonga versus <mark>Mayer</mark>.

The White House says President Donald Trump was referring to the plight faced by migrants when he said those who make the journey to the U.S. from Mexico are \"raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before .\" Trump said Thursday at a tax event in West Virginia that \"yesterday it came out\" that during \"this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before .\" Trump had previously mentioned a caravan of migrants working its way north through Mexico, so it appeared to some that he was suggesting the caravan was besieged by violence. But White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says it has been \"a widely reported fact for years\" that there is \"extensive and extreme victimization of those making the journey north with coyotes/smugglers in general .\" ------3:15 p.m. President Donald Trump is alleging without evidence that voter fraud is a huge problem in California. At a tax event in West Virginia on Thursday, Trump says that \"in many places, like California, the same person votes many times .\" He says, \"They always like to say,\" Oh, that's a conspiracy theory .' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. \"After the 2016 election, Trump alleged repeatedly and without evidence that voting fraud cost him the popular vote. Earlier this year he disbanded a voter fraud commission amid infighting and lawsuits as state officials refused to cooperate. While there have been isolated cases of voter fraud in the U.S., past studies have found it to be rare .------3:10 p.m. President Donald Trump is seething over immigration policies at a tax event in West Virginia. Trump on Thursday complained about catch-and-release policies and family based migration, in which immigrants sponsor their relatives to join them in the U.S. Trump also noted he'd been criticized for saying in his campaign kickoff speech that Mexico was sending rapists across the border. But he says that\" yesterday it came out \"that during\" this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. \"It's unclear what he was referring to, but a White House spokesman pointed to past reports of women being raped by smugglers. Trump announced this week that he was requesting the deployment of the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to fight illegal immigration and drug smuggling .------2:45 p.m. President Donald Trump is taking shots at Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin while visiting West Virginia. Speaking at a tax event Thursday, Trump referenced the fact that Manchin did not vote for his tax plan. He told the audience that they would get\" a chance to get a senator that's going to vote our program. \"He added that\" you're not getting that help right now. \"Trump says:\" Joe Manchin, he's really not helped us. \"Six Republicans are competing in a GOP primary to challenge Manchin, who is running for re-election. Trump easily carried the state in 2016 .------11:10 a.m. President Donald Trump plans to see two GOP Senate candidates during his visit to West Virginia. Trump is scheduled to hold a discussion on taxes in White Sulphur Springs later Thursday. Among those expected to attend are a congressman, <mark>Evan Jenkins</mark>, and the state's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. They're among six Republicans competing in the May 8 for the party's Senate nomination. The incumbent is Democrat Joe Manchin, who is seeking another term in November. Trump, who overwhelmingly won West Virginia in the 2016 president election, has stayed neutral in the Senate primary so far .------10:50 a.m. President Donald Trump is ready to discuss his tax overhaul with business owners and families in West Virginia. The White House says Trump will hear from West Virginia companies that provided benefits to workers due to the tax law, as well as from families and elected officials. The companies include two community banks and a truck dealership. Republican officials expected to attend include the governor, Jim Justice, and Sen. <mark>Shelley Moore Capito</mark>. Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax package into law in December. The Republican measure cut taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and gave more modest savings for many middle-class and lower-income Americans. The trip marks Trump's fourth visit to the state as president .------9:25 a.m.. The Trump administration hasn't determined how many troops it will seek to have deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. That's according to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. She says:\" We're going to be sending as many troops as we need. \"President Donald Trump has signed a memo clearing the way for the deployment of National Guard troops to the border. Ultimately, it will be up to the four border-state governors to finalize the numbers and precise timing. Nielsen says the administration wants the National Guard's help providing surveillance along the border and maintenance for border patrol vehicles and aircraft to free up law enforcement assets for securing the border. Nielsen says she'll be speaking again Thursday with California Gov. <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> about earning his support for the deployment .------8:05 a.m. President Donald Trump is praising the Mexican government for breaking up a\" caravan \"of Central American migrants and avoiding\" a giant scene \"at the U.S. border. In a tweet, the president credits\" the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them. \"The tweet comes hours after Trump signed a proclamation directing the deployment of National Guard troops to assist in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.

The event this year will be on Thursday. Thousands of lights will glow in downtown Aiken on Thursday for the annual Night of 1,000 Lights. Luminaries, weighed down by cans provided by Golden Harvest Food Bank, will line the streets and several shops will stay open later for downtown shoppers. Santa Claus and his elves will also be present at the event, which is hosted by the Aiken Downtown Development Association, or ADDA. \"It's just a fun, festive evening downtown,\" said Avery Spears-Mahoney, executive director of the ADDA. \"There's hundreds of people shopping and having dinner and it just kind of kicks off the season as far as the holiday shopping and enjoying all the downtown has to offer .\" Luminaries can be found along many of the streets downtown Thursday including The Alley, Laurens Street and Richland Avenue and participating shops will decorate their windows for a window decorating contest in between activities, Spears-Mahoney said. Gift wrapping will be set up outside, and area nonprofits are expected to offer sweets from cookies to hot chocolate and cider to patrons. The event runs from 6 to 8 p.m., though the shops stay open throughout the day and evening. <mark>Dan Smith</mark>, co-owner of Lionel Smith Ltd., is one of dozens of store owners who will extend their hours and said the men's clothing store participates each year. \"We have a lot of people walk in because it's beautiful downtown--a very\" Christmas-y,' old-town and nostalgic feeling, \"Smith said .\" Some people buy, not everyone purchases, some may come in later and buy (and) they generally use that night to come and look around. \"For those who are ready to purchase at the store Thursday, there will be an incentive .\" We do a Santa pick of the night and Santa will come through Wednesday night after we're closed and Thursday we'll have an item that might be discounted, \"Smith said .\" But we don't know what it is--Santa's elves do all of that work. \"3 Monkeys Fine Gifts will also offer special holiday deals, which were still in the works as of last week. Co-owner Kathy Reynolds said Night of 1,000 Lights is great for the community and business .\" It's a huge night for us, \"Reynolds said .\" It's a festive evening, brings out people from all over and it's always been well attended.
