Manomet, based in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is proposing the shellfish shift as a way to beat predators that plague Maine's clam diggers. Seafood lovers have sought Maine's softshell clams in chowders and clam rolls for decades, but wild harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers along the Maine coast to grow quahogs, study the results and bring the bivalves to market. \"Wouldn't it make sense to branch out and do this new species? One of the things that attracted us to quahogs was they seem to be less susceptible to predation from green crabs and marine worms,\" said Marissa McMahan, marine fisheries division director for Manomet, referencing a pair of pests that eat softshell clams. Shellfish farming is already common along the Maine coast, but quahog farming isn't practiced extensively. There were more than 90 shellfish leases in Maine totaling more than 700 acres last year, but the industry is dominated by oyster and mussel farming. Quahog farming is making money in Massachusetts, where state records show the value of farmed quahogs topped $1 million in 2017. Quahogs are also harvested wild in the ocean and tidal areas off the East Coast, and they're popular stuffed, steamed and in chowders. The shellfish also lends its name to a fictional Rhode Island town on the animated series \"Family Guy .\" The federal government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Sea Grant program has taken notice of Manomet's idea and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost. McMahan said the group provided the farmers with seed quahogs last month, and the shellfish are growing in Harpswell, Georgetown and West Bath farms. The first market-size quahogs are expected in 2021. Jordan Kramer, operator of the West Bath farm, said the growth of quahog aquaculture could help the state's farmers diversify. His farm, Winnegance Oyster Farm, was already raising some quahogs prior to joining the Manomet project, and the first bunch has reached maturity. \"It's a new option \ufffd a local option for an aquaculture product,\" Kramer said. Quahogs are still vulnerable to predators, such as green crabs, especially when they are young and small, said Brian Beal, a professor marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. So farmers are growing the quahogs in bags located in 10 to 30 feet of water, McMahan said. That will help protect them from the crabs, which prey on wild shellfish when they settle in mud. The growth of predators has become a bigger problem for softshell clams as the waters of the Gulf of Maine have warmed. The harvest fell to 1.4 million pounds, the lowest in decades, in 2017. The loss of the softshell clams has forced clammers to adapt, said <mark>Chad Campbell</mark>, one of the farmers working with Manomet on the quahog project in Georgetown. <mark>Campbell</mark> has dug for clams for 30 years and witnessed wild clamming fade as a way of life in Maine. \"We've seen the decline,\" he said. \"You can't rely on the wild harvest.

(Getty) Seahawks coach Pete Carroll put it plainly Sunday afternoon. \"I didn't do a good enough job,\" he told reporters after Seattle held on for a 27-20 win over a struggling Atlanta Falcons team. \"I'm telling you. Obviously, they went out there and we looked like we were a totally different team .\" Seahawks 27, Falcons 20: Recap & photo gallery | Britt hurt The Falcons outscored the Seahawks 20-3 in the second half of their contest in Atlanta. After halftime, they outgained Seattle 346 to 82 in net yards and had 21 first downs compared to just three for the Seahawks. Quarterback Matt Schaub, who started for the first time since 2015 in place of an injured <mark>Matt Ryan</mark>, was 26 of 32 for 309 yards. Seahawks quarterback <mark>Russell Wilson</mark>--a leader in the league's MVP race--had just five pass attempts against an Atlanta defense that ranks near the bottom of the league against the pass. You'd hardly guess the Seahawks won by a touchdown. But they did, and they were able to keep the Falcons at bay and improve to 6-2 thanks to a stellar first half. Seattle pulled ahead 24-0 in what was a dominant performance on both sides of the ball. <mark>Wilson</mark> and the Seahawks' offense had 240 yards and converted on all three of their trips into the red zone. <mark>Wilson</mark> himself was 9 of 15 passing for two touchdown against a porous Falcons defense. Running back <mark>Chris Carson</mark> bulldozed through defenders for 86 yards and another touchdown. Cornerback Shaquill Griffin had two tackles and two passes defensed and the secondary held its own despite being short a starting corner (Tre Flowers). Linebacker Mychal Kendricks made his first interception as a Seahawk and pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney sacked Schaub in a play that also forced a fumble in the final seconds of the second quarter. The first-half Seahawks boasted a franchise quarterback who made jaw-dropping plays to a top-tier veteran receiver, a punishing running back who could drag defenders for additional yardage, a young corner who flashed promise and veteran savvy in the front seven. They stayed competitive despite losing their starting center. They looked like an NFC contender. The second-half Seahawks? That's a different story. What remains to be seen is whether it remains the story of Seattle's season. A showing from Schaub For the second time this season, the Seahawks allowed 400 or more yards by an opposing passer. Cincinnati's <mark>Andy Dalton</mark> threw for 418 yards and two touchdowns in the season opener (a total that led all quarterbacks in Week 1), and on Sunday it was the 38-year-old Schaub who threw for 460 yards, one touchdown and one interception. It was the most passing yards any Seahawks team has allowed by an opposing quarterback during Carroll's coaching tenure. The next closest is Ben Roethlisberger, who threw for 456 yards against Seattle in November 2015. That's not to say Schaub didn't make mistakes. In fact, maybe that's why he's yet another name on a very interesting list: Quarterbacks who have lost to the Seahawks while throwing 400-plus yards. It now totals seven, according to 710 ESPN Seattle's Danny O\u2019Neil: Under Pete Carroll, #Seahawks are undefeated when allowing an opponent to throw for more than 400 yards! pic.twitter.com/BI4p2XersW--Danny O'Neil (@ dannyoneil) October 27, 2019 Wagner sets a new Seahawks record Sunday also brought a new franchise record. Linebacker Bobby Wagner has now registered more tackles than any other player in Seahawks history (985). \"He's got plenty of years left,\" Carroll said of the 29-year-old Wagner, who signed a three-year extension in July that keeps him under contract with Seattle through 2022. \"I don't know how anybody could ever break that record. I think he's going to own that forever. That's amazing that he's there already. But just a tribute to the unbelievable player that he is, his discipline, his toughness, his work ethic, everything.

(Photo by <mark>Mike</mark> Coppola/Getty Images for MTV) Getty Images for MTV Old Town Road by Lil Nas X received Diamond Certification by the RIAA this week. It became the 33rd in history and the fastest to achieve the honor. Not bad for a song that was originally produced in Atlanta for less than $50. Diamond is 10 times platinum, when a single achieves the equivalent of 10 million units when combining sales and streaming. Here is a list of the 33 courtesy of Business Insider which includes three singles by both Eminem and Katy Perry. Diamond symbolizes the top honor in the recording industry, but it is also the new standard for achieving prosperity in business. Acting in accordance with the Diamond Rule is the next evolution of managing relationships and winning in sales. It's the 4.0 version that tops silver, golden and platinum approaches in business. Let's look at 1.0, 2.0, and the 3.0 versions for background: Version 1.0 - The Silver Rule The Silver Rule is \"do no harm .\" As stated by Zigong, a disciple of Confucius, in the book, \"What I do not wish others to do unto me, I also wish not to do unto others .\" The Silver Rule merely shares what not to do. It's not a bad start. Case in point, beginning in 2000, Google famously coined \"Don't be evil\" as part of the company's corporate code of conduct. The problem with Silver is that it's not prescriptive. It doesn't tell you how to treat others in business. Analects Version 2.0 - The Golden Rule Throughout nearly every culture and religion, the Golden Rule has become the gold standard of human dynamics. The Golden Rule is simply \"treating others the way you would like to be treated .\" If the Silver Rule deals in what not to do, the Golden Rule broadens it to all situations. In 2015 with the founding of Alphabet, Google revised its motto of \"Don't be evil\" to \"Do the right thing--follow the law, act honorably, and treat each other with respect .\" This approach by Google is more aligned with the Golden Rule. Marriott even has an entire advertising campaign around the Golden Rule. Unfortunately, in sales and managing relationships, the Golden Rule a bad rule. Here's why: In most sales organizations, an acceptable conversion rate is about 25 percent, which means that only one out of every four opportunities converts into a sale. Because you were taught to follow the Golden Rule, it's fair to assume you know what your clients want based on what you would want if you were them. Unfortunately, just looking at the conversion rates tells us that there's an issue. If anything else in our businesses was failing 75 percent of the time, we would immediately look for ways to improve. The Golden Rule leads to suboptimal results. This is because not everybody wants the same thing or to be treated the same way. We always assume that if something is good for us, then it must be good for everyone else. And, that if we want to be treated in a certain way, then that must be how everyone else wants to be treated. Turns out, that assumption couldn't be further from the truth. It leads to failed sales opportunities and strained client relationships all the time!

(Photo by Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) Getty Images FACT: Gold is worth significantly more per ounce than silver. It can be as much as 100 times more valuable. It is also the denser of the two metals, which makes a specified volume of gold worth far more than an equal volume of silver. The very first Gold Certification Award by the RIAA was earned in 1958 to Perry Como for his hit single. Catch A Falling Star Version 3.0 - The Platinum Rule The next level of the Golden Rule was popularized by Dr. Tony Alessandra in 1996. It simply is \"treating others the way that they want to be treated .\" Grounded in emotional intelligence, the Platinum Rule asks you to accommodate the feelings of others. Dave Kerpen outlines the shortcomings of the Golden Rule in his book. Kerpen writes, The Art of People \"The Golden Rule, as great as it is, has limitations, since all people and all situations are different. When you follow the Platinum Rule, however, you can be sure you're actually doing what the other person wants to be done and assure yourself of a better outcome .\" The Platinum Rule is more outward facing in its approach. The focus shifts from, \"this is what I want, so I'll give everyone the same thing\" to \"let me first understand what they want...and then I'll give it to them .\" One of the challenges when completely focusing on the other person is that we can overlook how we're feeling and reacting to a situation. For example, we may go into a meeting with the best of intentions to apply the Platinum Rule, but then something happens where we feel upset or disrespected or unheard, and then our capability to actually apply the Platinum Rule is interrupted. Therefore, while the Platinum Rule is aspirational, we must also be true to ourselves and neutralize our biology in order to be capable of addressing the needs of others. Considered one of the wealthiest Americans of all time, <mark>John</mark> D. Rockefeller, business magnate and philanthropist, clearly understood the intrinsic value of the Platinum Rule. He said that, \"the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee and I will pay more for that ability than for any other under the sun .\" When you play the game of business by following the Platinum Rule, every game is an away game. You never have the home field advantage because success in the game is filtered through the needs and concerns of the other person. Your playbook focuses only on knowing how others want to be treated and what's important to them. Johnnie Taylor Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons FACT: Platinum is more sought after than gold because it is rarer. Only 160 tons of platinum are mined annually around the world, as opposed to 1,500 tons of gold. Also, platinum is denser than gold; a platinum ring will weigh significantly more than a same-size ring in gold. Platinum is the new symbol of prestige. Think of the \"platinum credit card,\" which often has better benefits and privileges than the \"gold card .\" In the 1970's, the RIAA awarded the first Platinum Single Award. It was earned by Johnnie Taylor for the song. Disco Lady Version 4.0 - The Diamond Rule The Diamond Rule takes the Platinum Rule to the next level. The key here is understanding both our own biology as well as that of our prospects and customers. Treating someone the way they want to be treated is tricky enough under normal circumstances--but what happens when things start to get heated? In the immortal words of former boxing heavyweight champion, \"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth .\" <mark>Mike Tyson</mark> Pressure can trigger a biological response that causes us to act in an unpredictable and irrational manner. Under pressure, our brain activates a hard-wired survival strategy every time it detects a perceived threat. Why is the Diamond Rule so critical in sales and managing relationships? The answer is simple. A sales situation is inherently full of pressure. To quote the late artists David Bowie and Freddie Mercury in, \"Pressure pushing down on me. Pressing down on you .\" Pressure can make things unstable. In sales, you need to manage yourself and your prospect/client through these difficult situations. The Diamond Rule combines elements of both Gold and Platinum. Said simply, the Diamond Rule is \"the art of managing yourself under pressure and addressing the needs of others to avoid their triggers .\" Under Pressure Rooted in the understanding of our own behavioral style and the style of others, the Diamond Rule allows you to solve problems and achieve prosperity in the pressure-filled game of business. Practicing the Diamond Rule requires two elements: 1) you have to see your own predictable behavioral style when pressure hits, and 2) you need the capability to assess prospects/clients relative to four different, predictable behavioral styles based primarily on how people respond biologically to pressure. Since we all tend to be pretty strong in only one of the four styles of Control, Influence, Power or Authority, it's no surprise that we tend to connect with those whose style is similar to ours but find ourselves challenged to connect with those who have a different style. Therefore, when working outside of our own category, we may be less effective, leading to upwards of a 75 percent failure rate in sales conversion. Diamond Rule Behavior The Diamond Rule is the most advanced approach for working effectively with other people. As a combination of the Golden Rule and the Platinum Rule, it requires you to consider and satisfy your own instinctive concerns and needs while simultaneously addressing the needs of others. While it takes keen awareness and presence to pull this off, it is truly the \"Holy Grail\" of human dynamics. Diamond Rule behavior means effectively managing your identity (personal brand) with others even when your biology (survival response to pressure) is getting triggered (feeling under attack) in the game of business. When you adhere to the Diamond Rule, you rise above pressure, reaching an elevation that makes it easy to focus on solving client problems and reducing the pressure they feel. This makes you stand out as unique and better in the eyes of your client, dramatically increasing your ability to win business. A diamond is a symbol of wealth and wisdom. The more you mine for diamonds in your pursuits, the more success you will reap. Unlike Gold or Platinum which can be molded, you need to work with the natural elements of Diamonds and the natural reactions of human biology. Are you ready to go Diamond to win in sales and managing customer relationships?

Diamonds are not found on the Earth's surface, they must be mined with a pick-axe while tunneling deep in the ground.
