precariously short of time, congressional leaders struggled in urgent, weekend-long talks to avert an unprecedented government default, desperate to show enough progress to head off a plunge in stock prices when asian markets open ahead of the u.s. workweek. with the white house consigned to the periphery of negotiations, republicans sought as much as $4 trillion in deficit cuts over a decade as a condition for raising the nation's debt limit. but after hours of staff negotiations followed by a meeting of congress' top four leaders, senate majority leader <mark>harry reid</mark> accused gop leaders of intransigence, adding he would not accept anything less than a deal that raised the debt limit through 2012. \"their unwillingness to compromise is pushing us to the brink of a default on the full faith and credit of the united states. we have run out of time for politics. now is the time for cooperation,\" he said in a sharply worded statement. there was no immediate response from either house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, or senate gop leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky. obama met earlier in the day with the republican and democratic leaders - but only briefly - the day after boehner abruptly broke off his own once-promising compromise talks with the white house. in talks through the afternoon in the capitol, congressional aides were looking at an immediate debt limit increase of about $1 trillion, officials said, with slightly higher spending cuts to be locked into place simultaneously. another $1.4 trillion in additional borrowing authority would be needed to satisfy obama's demand that any deal extend into 2013, and based on <mark>reid</mark>'s accusation, it was clear the two sides had not yet been able to bridge their differences. on one point, there was no disagreement - time is running out. congressional aides labored to produce a tentative agreement by monday, congressional officials said. even that would allow scarcely enough time for the house and senate to clear legislation in time for obama's signature by the aug. 2 deadline, a week from tuesday. more urgently, boehner told rank-and-file republicans in a conference call he hoped to be able to announce a \"viable framework for progress\" by 4 p.m. edt on sunday, before the stock markets open in japan and elsewhere in asia, according to two participants. lawmakers fear a big drop in investor confidence in stocks and bonds could start in asia and sweep toward europe and the americas, causing u.s. stock values to plunge on monday. barring action by aug. 2, the treasury will run out of the money needed to pay all its bills, triggering a possible default that could seriously damage the domestic economy and send damaging waves across the globe. obama has warned repeatedly of the possibility of a spike in interest rates that could affect americans' mortgages, credit cards and other forms of personal debt. \"the bipartisan leadership in congress is committed to working on new legislation that will prevent default while substantially reducing washington spending,\" mcconnell said in a written statement not long after he, boehner and democratic leaders met with obama at the white house. obama appeared grim-faced as he convened the meeting around the big table in the white house cabinet room. he was flanked by boehner, r-ohio, and <mark>reid</mark>, d-nev. vice president joe biden, mcconnell and pelosi also attended. the only aides attending the white house meeting were budget director jack lew and treasury secretary tim geithner, who emphasized the concern about asia. afterward, white house press secretary jay carney issued a stern statement: \"congress should refrain from playing reckless political games with our economy. instead, it should be responsible and do its job, avoiding default and cutting the deficit .\" sixteen blocks away at the capitol, congressional aides said the white house would not have a presence at the bargaining table with house and senate leaders. under normal procedures, boehner would need to have legislation on the house floor by wednesday to allow enough time for a measure to reach obama's desk in time to meet the debt-limit deadline. negotiators were working against two avowedly non-negotiable demands - obama's insistence on a plan that assures no rerun of the current crisis until 2013 at the earliest, and boehner's requirement that spending cuts over 10 years must exceed the size of any increase in borrowing authority - without any rise in taxes. to comply with both edicts, under most estimates, legislation would have to cut more than $2.4 trillion across the next decade, since that is the amount of additional borrowing authority the treasury is expected to require to pay the nation's bills. also complicating the talks were divisions within each party. liberal democrats are generally opposed to cuts in medicare and social security, while obama hopes to use the negotiations to appeal to voters who want big cuts in federal deficits. tea party-backed republicans, dozens of whom are in the house, adamantly oppose any higher taxes, while obama has made more revenue the price of admission to the talks. it was unclear how much <mark>reid</mark>, pelosi, boehner and mcconnell would rely on the results of earlier talks, those that biden held with lawmakers for several weeks in the capitol and negotiations obama had with leaders in a group and with boehner. judging from accounts provided by officials in both parties, obama had previously agreed to significant changes in benefit programs, including raising the raise of eligibility for medicare from 65 to 67 for future recipients, and also slowing the projected rise in social security cost of living benefits. his concessions triggered a revolt earlier in the week by senate democrats, who feared he was giving away too much without getting enough additional government revenue in return. for his part, boehner had been ready to agree to an overhaul of the tax code that would result in a net increase of revenue to the government of $800 billion over a decade. there also had been a general agreement to cut $1 trillion or more from hundreds of government programs ranging from the park service to foreign aid and agriculture, and to chalk up another $1 trillion in savings by assuming the end of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. there was another possible element of a deal on the shelf - legislation that mcconnell and <mark>reid</mark> have developed that would let obama raise the debt limit by $2.4 trillion in three installments over the next year or so without prior approval by congress. instead, he would be required to recommend spending cuts assured of coming to a vote in congress. additionally, that proposal envisions establishment of a special congressional committee to recommend cuts in benefit programs such as medicare and social security and possibly draft a tax reform bill as well. it was boehner's decision friday night to break off his talks with the white house that triggered an extraordinary evening in which divided government briefly appeared to be irretrievably gridlocked. the speaker said obama wanted higher taxes and not enough spending cuts, adding, \"it's the president who walked away from his agreement .\" but speaking to reporters at the white house, obama said he had offered an \"extraordinarily fair deal\" that totaled $2.6 trillion in spending cuts and $1.2 trillion in additional revenue. \"i've been left at the altar now a couple of times,\" he said wryly, adding that boehner had declined to return his phone calls. police search for man accused of robbing midway ralphs updated: a man robbed a midway grocery store pharmacy counter saturday and police continued to search for the suspect. crews battle brush fire on side of i-5 in encinitas updated: a brush fire on the side of interstate 5 in encinitas saturday prompted the brief closure of two northbound lanes of the freeway while firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze, the chp said. crews battle \"eagle's nest\" brush fire near warner springs updated: a brush fire that scorched some 4,000 acres on the los coyotes indian reservation was about 30 percent contained saturday, according to cal fire. escondido police arrest man accused of taking pictures up women's skirts updated: a 41-year-old man was jailed saturday for allegedly using a camera in his cell phone to take images from under the skirts of women at a escondido store, police said. biker rally in jamul is peaceful, authorities still in area updated: the san diego sheriff's department says that a biker rally in the east county is a peaceful one. escondido curfew sweep ends with 16 juveniles arrested updated: escondido police arrested 16 juveniles for curfew violations, including two 15-year-old girls who found in the company of a register sex offender, a lieutenant said saturday. woman robs el cajon bank, said she had gun updated: police and the fbi sought the public's help today in catching a woman who robbed a bank in el cajon. man dead after motorcycle drifts off sr 94 and strikes power pole updated: an autopsy was pending saturday on a 43-year-old san diego man killed when the motorcycle he was riding drifted off state route 94 and struck a power pole, the california highway patrol said saturday. 1 found with large amount of drugs during imperial beach warrant sweep updated: sheriff's deputies in imperial beach arrested 15 people in a warrant sweep, including a 50-year-old man found with about $35,000 worth of pot growing at his home, sheriff's deputies said saturday. stars come out to celebrate third day of comic-con", "articleID": "2011072401_00044618_W", "names": {"Harry Reid": ["Q19650494", "Q21466700", "Q314459", "Q5671912"]}}, {"date": "2011-07-25", "url": "http://therecord.com/news/local/article/568750--guelph-family-hopes-for-closure-after-discovery-of-plane-in-lake-muskoka-for-71-years", "content": "guelph - it was snowmageddon, only the word hadn't been coined yet. on dec. 12, 1940, the snow was flying fast and furious in high winds when an aircraft on a training flight from the royal canadian air force base in borden went missing over lake muskoka. the next day, though the weather was still treacherous and the countryside and lakes still frozen, two aircraft took off to search for the missing plane. hours later, the planes, northrop a-17a nomads, collided and plummeted into the deep, icy waters of lake muskoka. one plane was found within weeks and the bodies of the two pilots recovered. the other aircraft and its pilots - a brit, <mark>peter campbell</mark>, 24, and a guelph native, ted bates, 27 - were never located. until recently. the nomad has been found resting at the bottom of the lake near browning island, a few kilometres west of bracebridge. it's what 84-year-old tom bates, ted's younger brother, has hoped to hear all his life. \"i'm glad they found the plane,\" he says. \"my parents thought about it often .\" about 400 aircraft went missing in canada during the second world war, largely during training exercises and transport missions. some have been located but a nomad is a rare find, says laurel clegg, casualty identification co-ordinator for the department of national defence. \"they were used in the early stage of the war .\" the department is working with the ontario provincial police in the investigation. \"it's a complex case,\" clegg says, adding it isn't known if or when the plane can be raised. in guelph, tom bates can't wait to see a ring divers found in the wreckage. \"it's ted's...i've seen the photos,\" he says. tom was only 14 when his older brother, died, but he remembers how he doted on him. \"he took me up in a plane in brantford when i was 12,\" he says. \"i remember every moment .\" tom says his brother was also well known in his hometown of guelph because he was a musician as well as a pilot. he played the saxophone and the clarinet with a band that toured in ottawa and vancouver. a commercial pilot, ted got his wings in 1936 and was based in ottawa when he was asked by the army, a few months after the war started, if he would teach flying. ted, an adventurer, said yes, and graduated dec. 12, 1940, from a teaching course at the royal canadian air force base at borden. he was supposed to go on vacation the next day, but when he heard about the missing pilot he volunteered for the search mission. on dec. 13, flight lt. <mark>peter campbell</mark> and leading aircraftsman ted bates climbed into the cockpit of their northrop nomad, the last time anyone saw them. efforts were made to recover their plane but the weather was still treacherous in the months following the crash, and technology nothing like what it is now. nomads, originally built as two-seater \"attack bombers,\" were big aircraft - they weighed about 3,175 kilograms, had a 16-metre wingspan, stood four metres tall - but for a long time, no one really knew where exactly this plane went down in lake muskoka. (the lake is more than 30 metres deep in places .) then matt fairbrass stepped in. president of lost airmen in muskoka project, a group dedicated to finding missing aircraft, fairbrass and his friends learned some years ago that a family of trappers living beside the lake had actually seen the crash and the two planes plunging into the water. backed by eyewitness accounts and military maps of the crash site, the group started searching. \"i spent hours, hundreds of hours, looking for it,\" says fairbrass, who used side-scan sonar. \"it's like a golf ball in middle of a football field. blink and you miss it .\" fairbrass and his friends, al bacon and don ruud, narrowed the potential sites down to three then called in the opp. the provincial police underwater search and recovery unit found the plane last fall. \"it was so good to see that the plane had been located,\" said fairbrass. \"these men made a sacrifice...this is the least we can do for them .\" it's not yet clear if any remains of the two pilots have been recovered. <mark>campbell</mark>, from west sussex in england, came to canada in 1940 as part of the successful empire air training scheme to train pilots from the

(bloomberg)--ford motor co., the second-largest u.s. automaker, said second-quarter profit beat estimates as buyers paid more for models such as the fiesta subcompact. net income fell to $2.4 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier, dearborn, michigan-based ford said today in a statement. excluding some items, profit was 65 cents a share, beating the 61-cent average of 14 analysts' estimates compiled by bloomberg. sales climbed 1.4 percent to $35.5 billion even after last year's sale of volvo cars. ford is set to begin negotiations this week with the united auto workers union to close a gap in labor costs with rivals. chief executive officer alan mulally raised prices for fiesta cars and explorer sport-utility vehicles to offset some of the $4 billion in higher costs that ford expects this year, including manufacturing spending. \"there are various kinds of initial hits to the bottom line as you're bringing out new product, but if it's done right you make that up on the back end,\" <mark>stephen brown</mark>, a chicago - based analyst at fitch ratings, said in a phone interview before results were released. industrywide u.s. vehicle sales slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.1 million in the second quarter from 13.1 million in the prior three months, according to autodata corp. ford's u.s. deliveries rose 9 percent to 1.07 million in the first half, trailing the industry's 13 percent gain. the 9 percent figure includes year-ago sales of volvo vehicles. ford raised prices three times and lowered discounts more than the industry average in their home market during the first half, according to woodcliff, new jersey-based autodata. mulally's plan mulally, 65, is betting u.s. consumers will switch from larger vehicles to more fuel-efficient cars such as the fiesta as gasoline prices rise and pay more for amenities such as heated leather seats. * regular unleaded gas has exceeded $3.50 a gallon in the u.s. since march,

demand for the automaker's pickups and suvs. ford had $30.1 billion in losses from 2006 through 2008, before earning $9.28 billion in the last two years. ford fell 14 cents to $13.17 yesterday in new york stock exchange composite trading. the shares have declined 22 percent this year after a 68 percent gain in 2010. ford's second-quarter sales of $35.5 billion topped nine analysts' average

kansas, but it can't beat these flint hills,' surmised phar as he sat down on a plush leather couch in his quaint, immaculate cowboy home with attached five-stall horse barn. there's no question about the lifestyle as two saddles, boots with spurs attached, bridles, hats, horse photograph-adorned walls and a big wooden coffee table cluttered with cowboy books and leather-bound albums engraved with phar's two brands that also grace the overhead entranceway to what he calls a\" play ranch. \"it's really 135 acres of formerly just native pastureland a short distance north of council grove in

which the phd nutritionist is known throughout the country .\" my sons, matt and justin, live at olathe, and i'd always been doing cattle business around here, so i feel fortunate to have bought this place, \"said phar, who moved from his home and horse facilities on 20 acres at scott city. raised on a hereford farm in illinois, phar said,\" i always wanted a horse, and i finally convinced dad that we needed three or four to do the cattle work. \"contending his initial mounts were incomparable in ability to the pair in his barn today, phar still followed his cowboy instincts to complete undergraduate animal science education at the university of illinois .\" they had a few good <mark>king</mark> ranch and peppy-bred quarter horses, and i was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with them, \"phar said. graduate studies were at kentucky where phar completed his degrees and came to kansas state university when offered a position .\" as i was driving down the highway, got to about maple hill and saw these flint hills, i knew this was where i wanted to be, \"phar said. that was 1966, and he served as the first feedlot specialist at k-state .\" i was really on the ground flour of the feedlot industry in the state, \"phar said .\" crofoot at strong city along with winter and brookover in western kansas were the biggest feedlots around at that time, \"phar said. during his time at the university, phar had horses, roped some, helped ranchers, judged local horse shows and served as faculty advisor for the chaps (rodeo) club. obviously, feedlots were a fast-growing industry, and, by 1972, phar was in demand to assist managers in formulating nutritional needs of cattle on feed .\" i moved to scott city and started my consulting business, \"he said. feedlot operators, stocker producers and cow-calf programs in several midwest states sought phar's nutrition advice .\" i had about 20 clients with more than 200,000 cattle at one time, \"phar said .\" i had to be on the road a lot, working in colorado, kansas, montana, nevada and wyoming. \"while providing others with nutrition knowledge, phar was also in the cattle business personally and developed feedstuffs now familiar to many. a photograph in one of the albums tells a story he's pleased to share .\" i encouraged cattle feeders to put wheat straw in finishing rations, \"phar said .\" there's lots of straw from all of the wheat in kansas. \"leading quarter horse trainer billy allen had some of the top horses in the country three decades ago, and phar developed the ration now merchandized as billy allen horse feed .\" we were in a partnership, and i designed the mill still operated by that feed business, \"said phar, who dispersed his interests to allen. during his diverse cattle endeavors, phar worked with and became good friends with kenny berg .\" when kenny settled back at manhattan, and was looking after lots of grass cattle, we developed a rumensin-based mineral that other cattlemen soon wanted to feed, too, \"phar said. manhattan milling manufactured the product for phar and berg, who became partners in the bluestem mineral business .\" we still sell the mineral, and it's now made by rw milling and countryside feeds, \"phar said .\" kenny handled mineral deliveries for a long time, but now countryside distributes most of it bagged and bulk for us. \"the phar place at scott city was popular for the cowboy crowd .\" i always had cattle for roping, and several nights every week during the summer, there would be a group there for practicing, \"said phar, who competed in team roping jackpots and feedlot ropings consistently for a number of years. his sons learned to ride and rope, and still have an appreciation for the sport .\" the boys have business degrees and live in olathe, but i like the rural life, \"phar said .\" they come here, and i go there, but we're generally ready to get back to our own places. \"always with a soft spot for helping anybody with a cowboy spirit, phar said,\" i usually keep a few corrientes here, and sometimes have practice sessions. \"cooper martin and brant mahanay just got back from a national junior rodeo. they come here fairly regularly,\" he added. phar's two grandsons sometimes ride when they visit. \"the one wanted to take a horse when we went to a youth rodeo the other day, so they might become cowboys sometime,\" phar said. when ropers come by to practice, phar will often saddle one of his horses, help pen steers and maybe shake out a loop if the mood strikes. \"i don't really ride all that much nowadays, but i've got a great pair of geldings,\" he said while praising them as they appreciated evening feed. critiquing his gray 18-year-old eddie red rose-jackie bee gelding called flint, phar said, \"i've always liked big horses, and i've had some good horses. this is one of the best. he's a top head horse and can get the job done right in the pasture .\" a sorrel 12-year-old smart little lena-peppy san badger gelding, called buddy, had experience before phar got him and complements the older horse, according to their owner. in addition to the two saddles in his home, phar's working tack is kept in one of two trailers in the barnyard. \"i've always liked and had good equipment,\" said phar as he showed the saddles custom made by j.m. capriola and <mark>john king</mark>. \"my saddles have slick forks and narrow seats. that makes a big difference in how they fit, and how they ride,\" phar said. a couple of the bridles hanging in the trailer are equipped with rawhide bosals that phar braided personally. \"i like to work with leather,\" he said as showing breast collars he'd designed and cut out personally. now down to just a couple nutrition clients, phar said, \"kenny knight was one of my first customers, and he's still with me, 39 years. i'm not planning to quit, but i don't want to work all of the time either .\" there are weight-lifting barbells in his barn, but phar contended, \"i go to the health center and use the exercise equipment there. it's not so dusty. it only takes 45 minutes, and i don't feel quite as well if i have to miss .\" reading has always been important to phar. \"i read at least two books a week. i need to take some of these to the library,\" he said. a past chairman of the kansas livestock and meat industry council, phar

in dallas is complete, but the park isn't open. and it won't open until a major problem is fixed. kayaker justin blake is one of the few who dares ride the rough water at the dallas waves park. officially, it's closed; too dangerous, city leaders say. blake now understands why after riding it for the first time this week. \"you could get seriously injured if you're not careful,\" he said. the city spent millions of dollars adding concrete dams to create the whitewater rapids. in march, construction was completed on the dallas wave and city leaders showed it off to the public. but it wasn't long before many realized that something was wrong. these rapids are far more powerful than expected, especially on a \"safety channel\" where waters should be calm, allowing even canoes to pass. \"it was very vicious,\" said teresa patterson, who was thrown out of her kayak by the water's force. it held her underwater even though she was wearing a life vest. patterson said she nearly drowned. \"i was getting really, really tired,\" she said. \"i think if i had to be there another minute, i might not have been able to fight to the surface, even with the life preserver .\" dallas soon quietly shut down the course. after spending $4 million on the project, city leaders now admit at least another $100,000 of work is needed to fix the channel and calm the waters. \"it's just been a big mess,\" said trinity river guide <mark>charles allen</mark>. \"it's had a really negative impact on my business. i've lost a lot of money myself .\" the whitewater project stranded

dollars that way,\" he said. \"they should have just left it alone!\" city leaders refused on-camera interviews, only sending a statement to news 8 that says safety is their highest priority. but directors of the project plan to hire an outside engineer to make sure - this time - the repairs work. that is likely at least a year away. critics say the timing couldn't be worse, coming just as the state tries to encourage more people to enjoy the rivers of north texas. instead, paddlers like eric neilsen now avoid the trinity. \"i think it's a boondoggle,\" he said. \"we have an unfinished

but steady climb. the names most mentioned in the rumor mills played key roles in the 3-1 victory over the red sox, one which moved the white sox within a half game of the carlos quentin scored the winning run with a seventh-inning walk in front of <mark>matt thornton</mark> pitched a scoreless eighth inning in relief of winner gavin floyd. suddenly everything looks brighter than it did a week ago, as the sox reached .500 for the first time since early july in winning their eighth game in the last 12 before a crowd of 27,513 at u.s. cellular field. and they did it by picking on their new personal patsy, albeit an unlikely one in the red sox, which has the best record in the al. friday's victory was their seventh straight and 14th in the last 16 games against them. ozzie guillen said when asked about the dominance. neither did he have an answer about possible trades, although he said general manager <mark>ken williams</mark> hadn't given him any hints like he did before the blue jays. \"i don't talk about it, players don't talk about it,\" guillen said. \"we bring somebody, we bring somebody. that's (media's) job to talk about trades. fans want to know. all the people think they are going to trade people .\" but right now, the white sox finally are playing like the experts thought they would, thanks in no small part to floyd, who is 6-0 in his career against the red sox, which played without baseball's best hitter adrian gonzalez (stiff neck). floyd pitched his third straight gem in a \"must-win\" game against a contender, going seven innings and allowing only three hits, one of them floyd beat central foes detroit and cleveland in his two previous games while allowing only one earned run in 15 1/3 innings. \"he has been really good,\" pierzynski said. \"he has been throwing strikes and being really aggressive .\" the white sox didn't score against veteran knuckleballer omar vizquel sacrificed him to second. he went to third on a wild pitch ahead of paul konerko's sacrifice fly. and then came the seventh inning with quentin's leadoff walk and pierzynski's homer off wakefield. \"that was the best knuckleball i've seen him throw and i've seen him a lot,\" pierzynski said. \"people see 65 (mph) and they don't realize how hard it is to hit. i just swung and it went out .\" well, i am still not convinced this sox team will win the division, but i will give their credit when the play well. i am not ready to drink the \"all in\" koolaid or be hood winked into claiming they have put it together. run off some wins and not lose to inferior teams, like kansas city and i may believe again. this homestand they should have won all the games. the one loss to detroit just happened. i'll reserve my judgement. last year they were 4 games ahead in august and how did that season end? huh? richardgasiorowski at 4:39 am july 30, 2011 whoa .500 for a 120m team - money well spent johnoo at 1:17 am july 30, 2011 yes, but watch out, the cubs are going

club,\" a period drama coming to nbc this fall, spent much of their time at television's summer press tour trying to shoot down what they say are false assumptions about the show. no, it's not a \"mad men\" clone, even if it does have a dapper don draper look-alike (eddie cibrian) at the center of its cast. also, it's not too raunchy for prime time, even though a conservative watchdog group has unleashed its wrath upon it. and, no, a show full of scantily clad \"bunnies\" being ogled by wolfish men is not demeaning to women. in fact, it's empowering. at least that's what they say. really. \"the show is all about empowerment and who these women can be, and how they can use the club to be anyone they want,\" producer chad hodge told critics. cast member naturi naughton echoed that sentiment. \"(the female characters) are smart, they're going to school, they're buying property--things they couldn't do at the time. they're using their resources,\" she said. as for racy material, producer ian biederman says the show is \"mild compared to a lot of things that are on television .\" those comments aren't likely to assuage the parents television council, which insists the show

who frequents hugh hefner's glitzy club and becomes involved with a new playboy bunny (amber heard). in addition to all the cotton tails and cleavage, they've tossed in an outlandish crime plot to spice things up. based on an early look at the pilot, \"the playboy club\" isn't excessively edgy. and it's not nearly as compelling as abc's \"pan am,\" the season's other retro drama. still, it's clearly the kind of show ghat gets people talking--the kind of show that struggling nbc needs, according to the network's new entertainment boss <mark>robert greenblatt</mark>. \"what it has going for it is a recognizable brand that's automatically going to draw attention to it, good or bad,\" he said. \"...it's the right kind of thing for us to try .\" as for those comparisons to \"mad men,\" <mark>greenblatt</mark> simply waves them off. \"i have great respect for\" mad men,' but apart from the setting and period being similar, i think (it's) much more of an energized soap opera. \"not
