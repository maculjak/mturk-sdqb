Originally released in 1993 and 1994, respectively, these two compilations will be re-released back into the physical market in compact and sleek new packaging. Each set includes full-color booklets with in-depth essays by Stax historian and compilations co-producer <mark>Rob Bowman</mark>. The volumes feature stalwart Stax R & B artists including Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers, Rufus <mark>Thomas</mark>, Johnnie Taylor, <mark>Carla Thomas</mark>, the Bar-Kays and <mark>William Bell</mark>, as well as bluesmen Little Milton, <mark>Albert King</mark> and Little Sonny, and \"second generation\" Stax hitmakers like Jean Knight, the Soul Children, <mark>Kim Weston</mark>, the Temprees, and Mel & Tim. Many of the tracks included in these collections will be made available digitally for the very first time. The story of the great Memphis soul label Stax/Volt can be divided into two distinct eras: the period from 1959 through the beginning of 1968, when the company was distributed by Atlantic and was developing its influential sound and image (chronicled in acclaimed 9-CD box set The Complete Stax/Volt Singles 1959-1968, released by Atlantic in 1991); and the post-Atlantic years, from May 1968 through the end of 1975, when Stax/Volt began its transition from a small, down-home enterprise to a corporate soul powerhouse. In Stax's early years as an independent label, founders <mark>Jim Stewart</mark> and Estelle Axton struggled with the loss of its back catalog to Atlantic/Warner Brothers Records and the loss of the label's most lucrative artist, Otis Redding, who tragically died in a plane crash months before. In need of funding and new stars, Axton and <mark>Stewart</mark> sold the label to Gulf + Western, bringing on promotion head Al Bell (who would soon become an equal partner and major figurehead of the label). In his Vol. 2 essay, <mark>Rob Bowman</mark> recalls, \"As the sun arose in Memphis on May 6, 1968 [the day Stax officially became independent of Atlantic], Stax had been essentially gutted. For all intents and purposes it was a new record company poised to issue its first few records .\" Comprised of nine CDs, Vol. 2 focuses on this period, 1968 through 1971, when Stax/Volt was forging ahead as its own entity. The 216-song collection includes all of the singles issued by the label during this time period, and features some of the biggest and best-loved hits of the day, including Isaac Hayes' Theme From Shaft, The Staple Singers' Respect Yourself and Johnnie Taylor's Who's Making Love, as well as a number of little-known gems by both major and less-familiar artists. By the end of 1971, <mark>Bowman</mark> notes, \"Al Bell's dream of [Stax/Volt] becoming a diversified full-line record company was several steps further along the line to being reality. The label now recorded a wealth of different styles and flavors of black popular music, ranging from the jazz and easy-listening proclivities of Isaac Hayes to the blues of Little Milton to the '70s disco-infused vocal style of the Dramatics to the gutsy soul of the Staple Singers .\" Indeed, the early 1970s found Stax/Volt a much bigger entity than ever thought possible during its initial split from Atlantic, with Isaac Hayes as its breakout star. Spurred by the success of Hayes' GRAMMY Award-Winning Shaft soundtrack in early 1972, the label was casting its net across a wide cross section of the entertainment industry, entering into new territory with soundtracks, comedy records, and even investing in a Broadway play. The Complete Stax/Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 3: 1972-1975, coming Spring 2015, covers this era of success and excess, when Stax's stars were shining bright, but the label was on the verge of its dramatic denouement. The 10-disc box set contains all 213 soul singles issued by Stax/Volt during this time, including such hits as <mark>Shirley Brown</mark>'s Woman to Woman and the Staple Singers' I'll Take You There. In 1976, faced with involuntary bankruptcy and an unsuccessful distribution deal with CBS Records, Stax was forced to close its doors. In his liner notes for Vol. 3, compilation co-producer Bill Belmont writes, \"Stax's difficult and inglorious end in no way diminishes its vital contributions to rhythm and blues and soul. Today, the music of Stax maintains a strong and steady presence, heard continually in cover versions by major artists, in movies and on television. Simply put, the Memphis Sound lives .\" And indeed it does. With a revival of the label in recent years, through Fantasy Records, the 2003 opening of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, Tenn., as well as several developing theatrical performances around the label, the music of Stax will continue to influence generations of musicians and fans alike .----------------------------------------------Never miss a story!

China's official Xinhua news agency reported that Mr Xi was accompanied by his wife, Peng Liyuan, and several Communist Party officials. He is the first Chinese president to visit North Korea in 14 years. The summit comes as both leaders are locked in separate disputes with the United States--Mr Xi over trade and Mr <mark>Kim</mark> over his nuclear weapons. There has been tension over the North's relentless push for nuclear weapons (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP, File) A Xinhua commentary said China could play a unique and constructive role in breaking the cycle of mistrust between North Korea and the US so they can work out a roadmap to achieve denuclearisation. The US has demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons development before international sanctions are lifted. North Korea has sought a step-by-step approach in which a step toward its denuclearisation would be matched by a concession from the US, notably a relaxation of economic sanctions. China backs what it calls a \"suspension for suspension\" proposal. Xinhua said both sides \"need to have reasonable expectations and refrain from imposing unilateral and unrealistic demands\". Experts say Mr Xi will likely endorse North Korea's calls for an incremental disarmament process. Mr Trump last met Mr <mark>Kim</mark> in February (AP/Evan Vucci, File) Chinese and North Korea media have said Mr Xi would stay in Pyongyang for two days. His meeting with Mr <mark>Kim</mark> would be their fifth summit since Mr <mark>Kim</mark> entered nuclear diplomacy with the United States and South Korea early last year. In an essay published in both countries' official media before his trip, Mr Xi praised North Korea for moving in the \"right direction\" by politically resolving issues on the peninsula. He did not mention Mr <mark>Kim</mark>'s nuclear diplomacy with the US in the article, much of which focused on lauding the neighbours' seven-decade relationship. Mr Xi said his visit will \"strengthen strategic communication and exchange\" between the traditional, though sometimes strained, allies. The nations fought together in the 1950-53 Korean War against the United States, South Korea and their allies, but there has been friction in recent years, especially over the North's relentless push for nuclear weapons. 0 comment"}, {"articleID": "2014113018_00021697_W", "names": {"Christopher Nolan": ["Q224912", "Q25191"], "Joan Collins": ["Q152843", "Q47122349", "Q6204959"], "Ray Rice": ["Q1523516", "Q23823439"], "Justin Long": ["Q298672", "Q6317841"]}, "date": "2014-11-30", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/entertainment/~3/2PZiYCbgglA", "content": "Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss Everdeen in a scene from \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 .\" \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 \u2033 was the clear choice among Thanksgiving moviegoers, but Katniss Everdeen didn't leave much left over for\" Horrible Bosses 2 \u2033 or \"Penguins of Madagascar\" to feast on, reports Variety.

state-run bank links up with San Francisco-based accelerator 500 Startups to provide expert advice to startups in a variety of tech fields Share this item with your network: <mark>Vladimir Kozlov</mark> Russian state-run bank Sberbank and San Francisco-based accelerator 500 Startups have launched a programme aimed at uncovering IT startups. The accelerator programme, a first for Russia, was announced in early September. It is inviting applications from startups in a range of fields, including e-commerce, advertising technology, educational technology, the internet of things (IoT), big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and cyber security. Sberbank holds almost one-third of Russia's aggregate assets in the industry and boasts more than 145 million customers in 20 countries. In recent years, the bank has increased its activity around tech innovation and is one of the largest investors in Russian tech startups, also investing in tech companies across the globe. In September 2018, Sberbank signed an investment deal with Israeli company ThetaRay, focused on cyber security. The bank also pumped cash into local company VisionsLab, which provides face-recognition technology. \"We are glad to cooperate with 500 Startups, which entrepreneurs all over the world dream about being invited to,\" said Lev Khasis, Sberbank's first deputy chairman of the executive board. \"It is important that our joint project is focused on selecting Russian startups and allows American companies to take part in the selection .\" There has been nothing like this in Russia before. During the acceleration programme, large Russian companies and Sberbank will become customers of the startups. So, taking part in our programme will enable them to test their products in real conditions and find future clients. \"More than 840 startups applied to the programme; 56% of them already had a minimum viable product and 15% had a product in open beta testing .\" The selection process was tough as we received applications from top teams from all over Russia, \"said Khasis .\" When making selections, we primarily looked at startups that could not only become an integral part of Sberbank's ecosystem, but could also have good prospects in the global market. \"I hope that during the acceleration, 500 Startups and the competences of the accelerator's Russian partners will help the teams to graduate to a new level of development .\" Read more about startups in Russia Annual IT event Startup Village in Russia saw blockchain take centre stage and support from the country's government. The annual Startup Village event near Moscow to showcase Russian innovators was the biggest yet. E-commerce was the most popular area for startups applying to the programme, accounting for 15% of all applications, followed by cloud services and lifestyle services with 9% each. AI and big data were also popular areas of activity, while other startups work in financial technologies, blockchain, digital healthcare and educational technologies. In late November, Sberbank announced a list of 30 startups selected for the programme. Each project will receive seed investment of up to 10 million roubles (US $150,000) and the possibility to promote their product in Sberbank's ecosystems and corporations, which are partners of the accelerator. According to Sberbank, all the selected startups already have working products and paying customers. One of them, Data Screen, develops technology for analysing and managing digital content distribution through the entire supply chain. Michael Ilyichev, partner at Data Screen, told Computer Weekly: \"Our project is at a stage when the solution is ready and needs to be scaled beyond Russia. We think that attention from 500 Startups and their community can help us with that .\" Find new customers Ilyichev said Data Screen expects participation in the programme to help to find new customers for the company's products outside Russia and attract international venture capital to the next funding round. Another startup, ArtLogics, has developed pooling. me, an online platform for cargo deliveries to retail chains. It ran a pilot project with major Russian food retailer Magnit and four of its suppliers this summer. \"We believe our project could potentially have a very big impact on Russia's logistics industry,\" said <mark>Pavel Vasilyev</mark>, managing director at ArtLogics. \"So when we heard about the accelerator of Sberbank and 500 Startups, we immediately realised that it would be exactly the kind of support that we need at this point, as both companies have enormous expertise and a network of contacts and could help us to develop this project in the right way .\" ArtLogics expects its participation in the programme to help it devise a growth strategy and make contact with retail and logistics operators in other markets to see if its technology is applicable outside Russia, said <mark>Vasilyev</mark>. Improving skills Meanwhile, Doczilla, a digital document creation service, expects taking part in the accelerator to improve its skills for product development and promotion, and to learn from 500 Startups' mentors about business scaling in Europe, the US and other countries, according to Kirill Buryakov, the company's CEO. \"We also hope to show Sberbank and its partner the possibilities of our platform and to launch pilot projects,\" he added. Alexander Fokin, general director of Calcul. ru, a service for calculating insurance payments that is also taking part in the programme, said: \"We would be certainly like to test ourselves in working with foreign customers .\" During the accelerator's first stage, the teams will work with startups in Moscow for nine weeks. The mentors of the teams will be specialists from 500 Startups, who will give lectures and seminars and provide one-to-one consultations. The final stage of the accelerator will be a demo day, where top managers from Sberbank, private venture investors and representatives of funds will choose the seven best startups. The winners will be sent to the US to take part in the Silicon Valley Exchange Programme. There, they will learn about international business practices and develop their products, before presenting their projects to Russian and foreign investors and large companies on a demo day in San Francisco.
