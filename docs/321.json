(AP Photo/Frank Victores) (Photo: The Associated Press) CINCINNATI (AP)--Geno Atkins simply shoved Dolphins guard Jermon Bushrod backward into Ryan Tannehill, knocking him down. The Bengals defense tackle then gently touched the quarterback down, one final indignity on a rough night. Miami's depleted offensive line had a tough time all around during a 22-7 loss to Cincinnati on Thursday night. And given the health of their blockers, the Dolphins (1-3) have a real challenge ahead. \"We've got to get it fixed and quick, and by that I mean Monday,\" Tannehill said. \"We're kind of in a dark spot right now. It's squarely on our shoulders.\" It was so bad that during the first three quarters, Bengals receiver A.J. Green had more yards than the entire Miami offense. Green piled up 166 yards on catches, while the Dolphins managed only 152 total yards. Tannehill was 15 of 25 for 189 yards with a touchdown, an interception, five sacks and a fumble. The Dolphins' running game--one of the NFL's worst--managed only 62 yards. \"Some of the plays were not ideal, as far as what we were doing,\" coach Adam Gase said. \"Some were busted protections. Ryan has to step up on the fumble. It's everybody taking their turn. I don't think it really mattered who was out right now. We couldn't get out of our own way.\" Tannehill had been a bright spot lately. He threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns during a win over Cleveland on Sunday, his second straight game with more than 300 yards passing. He had been sacked only one time in the last two games despite throwing 84 times. On Thursday, he threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Stills on Miami's second play of the game, but did little else the rest of the way. Miami finished with 222 total yards. It wasn't all Tannehill's fault. The patchwork line had trouble giving him time. \"Not everybody was on the same page,\" Gase said. \"All of a sudden he looks like he doesn't know what he's doing.\" There was a reason for the problems--Miami had a lot of players in different positions. The Dolphins were missing four starting offensive linemen, two linebackers, running back Arian Foster and tight end Jordan Cameron. Left tackle Branden Albert and center <mark>Anthony Steen</mark> were inactive with sprained ankles suffered during the win over Cleveland. Center Mike Pouncey has missed all four games with a hip injury. \"We have to put it all together and figure out what we do well and start working on that a little more,\" Gase said. ___ CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Jurgen Klopp's side face a titanic clash against an unbeaten, in form Manchester United side at Anfield on Saturday. The Reds have struggled in the Premier League recently, winning just one from their last four games. However, it's not uncommon for form to go out the window in these sorts of games - and Liverpool will be desperate for a win over their bitter rivals. Here are six things we spotted in their training session leading up to the big clash. Nervous, Jurgen? How Klopp would love a win at Anfield over Mourinho (Image: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Klopp enters the training ground with his band of merry men sporting something of a nervous smile. A victory over United would be the perfect way for his side to get back on track. The return of Firmino? The Brazilian could do with a confidence booster (Image: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Firmino's poor form led him to being dropped against Newcastle last time out. Looking sharp in training, the Brazilian could well be back in the starting XI for Saturday's lunch-time clash. Matip the main man \"More of that, Matip!\" (Image: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Liverpool's frail defence is by no means a secret and Romelu Lukaku and co will be looking to exploit it in any which way they can. Joel Matip will be heavily relied upon for Saturday and crunch tackles like the one above will be much appreciated by the Anfield faithful. He's SmilINGS Ings has been linked with a move to Newcastle (Image: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) The 25-year-old's Liverpool career has been blighted with injuries and he's recently been linked with a move to St. <mark>James</mark>' Park.

Last week we saw plenty of great' fits, but Frank Ocean and his large green Celine bag were a particular show-stealer. Snapped outside Louis Vuitton, the sleek leather Phoebe Philo-designed tote contrasted against the singer's casual combo of bright orange puffer, jeans, and beanie. It showed how the attitude toward bags in menswear is changing. You don't have to look femme or overdressed to sport a sizable accessory traditionally associated with women's fashion. In recent years, bags for men have gone from something almost taboo to one of the hottest trends, and the biggest industry players are keen to jump on board. In Milan, Fendi presented men's versions of the label's signature Baguette and Peekaboo bags, and a collaboration with Japanese luggage expert PORTER. A hybrid of a side bag and handbag in red, blue, and champagne-colored nylon with a golden F clasp, the Baguette is certain to be a sought-after model. At <mark>Kim Jones</mark>' Dior in Paris, almost every outfit was complemented by a bag: the new cross-body men's version of Dior's Saddle bag in silky nylon; neck wallets and small hard-case tube-shaped bags; soft fur bags; and more understated messenger-style numbers with metal buckles by <mark>Matthew Williams</mark> of ALYX.

For Fall/Winter 2019, almost every major fashion house had an updated it-bag for men, but few had worked on theirs as thoroughly as Virgil Abloh. In less than a year at Louis Vuitton, he has given us numerous versions of the Keepall: glow-in-the-dark; iridescent; semi-transparent neon pink and yellow; soft gray, and oversized black monogram-embossed in puffer material. This season also also gave us medium and purse-like mini versions of Louis Vuitton's signature retro travel trunks. Historically, men and bags have had a complicated relationship. Google the two words together and you'll find anxiety-laden questions along the lines of \"Are man bags acceptable?\" \"Can a man carry a purse?\" \"How to wear a man bag?\" and \"What do you put in a man bag?\" In the past, the rigid idea of masculinity allowed a backpack, a briefcase, or ideally nothing at all, stuffing your essentials into one's pockets. In fact, the very term \"man bag\" is an awkward attempt at emasculation. Louis Vuitton 4 more Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Previous Next Attitudes started to shift a few years ago. That went hand in hand with the rise of streetwear and was influenced by street culture references and \u201990s fashion. First fanny packs and then side bags became a menswear staple. It was a no-brainer, a combination of simple utilitarian design and practicality. The overwhelming success of outdoor and skate brands' versions were perhaps a turning point--think Patagonia, The North Face, Supreme, and Palace. It proved that in the menswear and streetwear markets, a bag can be a token of hype and obsession as much as the Birkin bag was for the Sex and the City generation of women. The side bag trend is still going strong, with the likes of Gucci, A-COLD-WALL *, and Burberry continuing to expand the range. The popularity of side bags was followed by the growing influence of even more masculine workwear and military designs: chest rigs (pioneered by ALYX), harnesses, and belt bags. The designs often played with fetish elements and added a bit of structure to relaxed sportswear silhouettes. The shift we witnessed on this season's runways, however, is bigger. Previously, men's bags were worn mostly as yet another garment and left hands-free, but now we're talking handbags and shoulder bags, styled and worn exactly as women do. As seen with Ocean's Celine tote, women's bags and purses are becoming more acceptable in men's wardrobes.

We are in some fun times,\" photographer Mordechai Rubinstein wrote recently on Instagram. \"A while back I posted a guy wearing a women's LV purse cross body. He took the strap from any old bag and put it on his mother's old purse.\" As a major driving force in contemporary fashion expression, hip-hop culture plays an integral part in this process. Tyler, the Creator has been rocking classic Chanel purses for a couple of years (check out dusty pink here or pale blue here). It feeds into the broader gender-bending fashion experimentation happening in hip-hop right now--think A $AP Rocky's Gucci babushka scarf or Young Thug's frilly blouses. Hip-hop culture has come a long way in challenging toxic masculinity while continuously incorporating an obsession with luxury fashion labels. If rappers are carrying Chanel purses, it's going to end up on the street soon enough. At the same time, the rise of the men's it-bag is also simply business. Bags are one of the largest sources of revenue for global luxury labels, so the math is simple: get men to buys bags and you'll sell twice as many bags. With consumption habits increasingly shaped by the more gender-neutral space of streetwear, the younger generation is becomes more comfortable with genderless shopping when it comes to accessories.

The gender binaries of luxury fashion are blurring, but that can mean a curious migration of status symbols from womenswear to menswear and back again. \"Last year, we argued that sneakers had replaced handbags as the biggest status symbol in women's fashion,\" wrote Highsnobiety senior staff writer Lia McGarrigle recently. \"Looking to flex? A hard-to-get pair of kicks will impress a lot more than an off-the-rack <mark>Alexander Wang</mark> bag. It's not crazy to think the opposite could soon become true for men.\" In these uncertain times, luxury is a fluid business. Sometimes it's about inventing something new, sometimes it's about picking up something old like a classic Chanel purse and giving it a new spin. It seems the only thing that's left is deciding what to call it.

with the board, every institution except the university of florida asked the governors for the maximum increase allowed under the state's \"differential tuition\" law. uf decided to ask for a 9 percent increase after president bernie machen and some of the school's trustees expressed unease with going to the full 15 percent. the university of south florida initially told the board it would seek a 15 percent increase, but later trustees decided it will instead ask for an 11 percent increase. but the universities' requests also include forecasts that, without additional state funding, the schools will likely ask for 15 percent increases again in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 budget years, though those predictions are not binding and are tied to built-in assumptions about future state spending. the forecasts don't include uf, because its board voted on its request later than other universities. the board of governors is expected to vote on the recommendations thursday, at the end of three days of meetings that will include in-depth reviews of each university's plan for the next three years. many of the universities stressed the benefits of the additional tuition dollars they have received in recent years and the added funds they would draw down under the plans. florida a & m university, for example, said it was able to offer 859 classes that otherwise wouldn't have been offered during the 2011-12 school year without differential tuition dollars. florida international university wrote that it would use $13.3 million to hire undergraduate faculty with an eye on increasing graduate rates. that would be by far the lion's share of the money, with only $12.3 million earmarked for financial aid coming close. on the other hand, universities warned of dire consequences if the board doesn't approve their requests. \"there will be a significant negative impact on availability of required general education course sections, students' ability to obtain required courses, resulting in inability to continue education, larger class sizes, decreased graduation rates, increased time to degree and excess hours from taking unnecessary courses if required courses are not available,\" famu wrote. florida atlantic university said it would be forced to cut 75 faculty positions, nine advisors and 500 classes if the differential tuition increases aren't approved. and the university of central florida said its already-rising class size would increase even faster. \"without differential tuition, the university of central florida's ability to continue to provide high-quality access to undergraduate degrees is at risk,\" the request says. florida state raised the specter of an increasing exodus of faculty members, lured to other states by higher salaries. the requests from universities also show how the schools have used the 30 percent of the funding required to be devoted to need-based financial aid. in some cases, the amounts given to individual students vary widely, with 752 students at florida gulf coast university receiving anywhere between $50 and $6,482. the average award at fgcu was $1,847. the push comes at the same time that scott has pushed universities not to boost tuition. in a radio interview earlier this month, scott--who is set to meet with the board on tuesday--repeated his hesitance about increase the costs of college. \"we cannot continue to raise tuition constantly on the backs of our families,\" scott told 97.3 the sky radio in gainesville. \"they cannot afford it ....i'm against raising tuition.\"

"Chelsea dump Arsenal, United edge Everton LONDON: Chelsea went five points clear at the top of the Premier League after a 2-0 win at home to Arsenal in a fiery all-London clash on Sunday. Eden Hazard gave Chelsea a 27th-minute lead with a coolly-taken penalty after he had been brought down in the box by Gunners defender Laurent Koscielny. Diego Costa's ninth goal in seven Premier League games after an excellent lofted through-ball from former Arsenal favourite Cesc Fabregas sealed Chelsea's victory 12 minutes from time. Kick-off at Stamford Bridge was delayed by 15 minutes as officials slowed the entry of Arsenal fans into the away end after a flare was set off. There was a flare-up of a different kind when Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger clashed with Jose Mourinho on the touchline, the Frenchman pushing his Portuguese counterpart to one side before the feuding bosses were separated. Chelsea then saw goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois leave the field with suspected concussion following a collision with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez. Victory saw Chelsea go five points clear of second-placed reigning champions Manchester City and meant Wenger was still left searching for his first win against a Blues side managed by Mourinho in what was his 12th attempt. This defeat, Arsenal's first in the Premier League this season, left the Gunners nine points off top spot. It also extended their miserable away record at their English title rivals, with the Gunners now having won six points from 21 league matches at the home grounds of top five clubs. Earlier, Radamel Falcao's first goal for Manchester United secured a 2-1 victory over Everton. Colombia striker Falcao-signed on loan for a reported 10 million euros (\u00a3 7.8 million, $13.1 million) on transfer deadline day-marked his fourth United appearance by scoring from inside the box after getting on the end of Angel di Maria's long-range shot in the 62nd minute. Argentina midfielder di Maria had given Louis van Gaal's side a 27th-minute lead when he curled in a shot from just inside the penalty area after an excellent pass from <mark>Juan Mata</mark>. Everton could have equalised on the stroke of half-time after they were awarded a penalty when Luke Shaw brought down <mark>Tony Hibbert</mark>. But Leighton Baines's spot-kick was too close to David de Gea, who dived to his right to make a fine one-handed save-the first of several fine stops. However, Baines recovered his composure to whip in a superb cross from which Gary Naismith headed Everton level 10 minutes after the break. Stoppage-time saw de Gea preserve United's lead with two impressive saves to deny Everton substitutes Leon Osman and Bryan Oviedo. The result meant United had their first back-to-back successes under Dutch manager van Gaal following last week's 2-1 victory at home to West Ham. \"David de Gea was fantastic,\" van Gaal told the BBC. \"It was not easy for him because he had a lot of players in front of his view. Despite that he stopped good and speedy shots.\" Turning to his new goalscorer, the manager said: \"Falcao was forcing himself last week against West Ham. I told him to be satisfied about his performances and that the goals are coming. The goals are coming!\" Everton's defeat was compounded by John Stones being carried off on a stretcher late on-placing a question mark over the defender's participation in England's upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers with San Marino and Estonia. \"John Stones has an ankle ligament problem. It's too early to know the extent of it but it must be something serious for him to come off,\" said Everton manager Roberto Martinez. Christian Eriksen's 40th-minute shot from the edge of the box was good enough to give Tottenham Hotspur a 1-0 win at home to high-flyers Southampton-the club Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino left before moving to White Hart Lane in pre-season.

(AP)--An aluminum company planning to build a $1.7 billion plant in Appalachia announced a management shakeup as it tries to complete financing for a long-promised Kentucky project staked to millions in taxpayer money, but the company's top executive later disputed that he had stepped down. The boardroom drama began when Braidy Industries said Thursday that its chairman and CEO, Craig Bouchard, would step down from that role but remain a member of the company's board of directors. The company offered no reason for the change, which comes at a crucial time for efforts to build the mill near Ashland. Bouchard disputed the company announcement Friday, saying on social media that he did not authorize the company release and had not relinquished his job. The company said in the release that its current president, Tom Modrowski, had been named interim CEO and current board member Charles Price would serve as board chairman. The company didn't immediately respond to Bouchard's comments disputing the shakeup. Braidy said in the Thursday release that the shakeup comes as the company enters \"its final fundraising stage.\" \"Tom and the board will continue to focus our efforts on completing fundraising and planning for construction of the Ashland mill,\" Price said in the Thursday release. Advertising Despite those assurances, the Kentucky Senate's top leader expressed uncertainty Friday when asked if he remains confident the project will come to fruition. \"Until it gets built, you always have to have concerns,\" Senate President <mark>Robert Stivers</mark>, a Republican, told reporters. Bouchard had been the public point man for the project--long touted to bring a badly needed infusion of jobs to a struggling region. The company has said it will create 1,500 construction jobs and more than 650 full-time jobs once the plant starts production. The mill is to be built not far from where Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia meet on the Ohio River. The Bluegrass State also has a financial stake in the project. In a rare move, former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin persuaded the state legislature to approve a $15 million investment in the project, making taxpayers partial owners of the planned mill. The state investment sparked a legal fight, led by the Courier-Journal, for records detailing the company's finances. Gov. Andy Beshear's administration recently released those records. Advertising Word of the company's shakeup brought responses from the top levels of state government. \"We were previously advised of these changes and it is our understanding they do not impact the current status of the project.\" Beshear spokesman Sebastian Kitchen said in a statement before Bouchard's social media post disputing the company announcement. The governor's office later said it didn't have any additional information to share. Beshear ousted Bevin in last year's election. Republican House Speaker <mark>David Osborne</mark> noted that local officials near the planned mill remain confident that the project is moving forward and will be completed. \"I know this governor's office is committed to seeing it through,\" the speaker said. \"It's a project that's going to mean generational change for that area.\" <mark>Osborne</mark> also spoke before Bouchard's social media comments. Braidy's Kentucky project drew widespread attention when the company forged a partnership with Russian aluminum giant Rusal, which previously faced U.S. sanctions for connections to a Russian oligarch.
