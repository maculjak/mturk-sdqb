According to Tribble's prepared statement obtained by Axios, he plans to\" convey Apple's support for comprehensive federal privacy legislation that reflects Apple's long-held view that privacy is a fundamental human right. \"Tribble will echo sentiments that Apple executives have shared time and time again, explaining Apple's belief that customers have a right to keep their personal information private, a stance that differs from companies like Facebook and Google. Back in June, Apple CEO <mark>Tim Cook</mark> said in an interview that privacy\" from an American point of view \"is one of the\" key civil liberties \"defining what it means to be American. <mark>Cook</mark> has also said multiple times that Apple's customers are not its product .\" We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customers, \"<mark>Cook</mark> said in March .\" If our customers were our product. We've elected not to do that. We're not going to traffic in your personal life. \"Tribble will be testifying before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation alongside representatives from other tech and media companies that include Amazon, Twitter, Google, AT & T, and Charter Communications. Ahead of the meeting, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, released a proposal for consumer data privacy protection and is seeking public comment. The NTIA is asking for feedback on certain desired outcomes for organizational practices: [*] Organizations should be transparent about how they collect, use, share, and store users' personal information. [*] Users should be able to exercise control over the personal information they provide to organizations. [*] The collection, use, storage and sharing of personal data should be reasonably minimized in a manner proportional to the scope of privacy risks. [*] Organizations should employ security safeguards to protect the data that they collect, store, use, or share. [*] Users should be able to reasonably access and correct personal data they have provided. [*] Organizations should take steps to manage the risk of disclosure or harmful uses of personal data. [*] Organizations should be accountable for the use of personal data that has been collected, maintained or used by its systems. These are the same kind of topics that will be explored during the privacy-focused Senate hearing, which is designed to\" examine the privacy policies of top technology and communication firms \"as well as review the\" current state of consumer data privacy. \"Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts. Axios Quote\" We want your device to know everything about you; we don't feel that we should, \"he'll say .\" These concepts have guided our design process for years because privacy is a core value at Apple, not an obligation or an aftermarket add-on. \"Click to expand...Never heard of that guy before, on reading the title I thought - what's a Bud Triddle? #6 CarlJ said: \u2191 This seems like an exceptionally good idea. The list of points seem quite reasonable, and hard to argue against it being a good idea. Not sure why this needs to be in PRSI. Someone will probably be along shortly to prove the need. Click to expand...Since it's about potential law it's definitely political simply by nature. Either way I suspect 99% of posters will support this idea as we all know what bunk it is to wreck encryption wholesale just because (once again) authorities want to throw around\" national security \"in order to do ridiculous things and give powerful tools to people who have proven they can't properly secure what they already have. #11 It is big for Apple to do this. One of their key competitive advantages is their stance on privacy and how that informs every aspect of what they do. It is better for the long-term survival of our union to have privacy listed as a fundamental human right, but in some ways it weakens their position in the market. If Google was held to the same standard as Apple when it comes to privacy, I'd be more inclined to use Google's software and services. Would I actually end up using them? Maybe not, but for me privacy and security are the #1 top concern, followed by design and use of use."}, {"articleID": "2018011912_00555180_W", "names": {"Elizabeth Cook": ["Q1331177", "Q5362618"]}, "date": "2018-01-19", "url": "http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/national/15867120.Barry_Bennell_abuse_complainant_says_ex_Crewe_manager_Dario_Gradi_arranged_sleepovers/", "content": "File photo dated 8/1/2018 of Court artist sketch by <mark>Elizabeth Cook</mark> of Barry Bennell appearing via videolink at Liverpool Crown Court where he is accused of 48 counts of child sexual abuse.

He was drafted with the sixth overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft out of the University of Kentucky and played in the NBA from 1996 to 2008. Walker played for the Celtics, Mavericks, Hawks, Heat, Timberwolves, the BSN's Mets and the NBA D-League's Stampede before retiring from basketball in 2012. Walker, a three-time NBA All-Star, won an NCAA championship with Kentucky in 1996 and an NBA championship with the Miami Heat in 2006. Contents [show] Pre-NBA career Edit Walker attended Mount Carmel High School, in Chicago, where he played with future NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and attained all-state status as a senior, earning a full scholarship to play for Rick Pitino at the University of Kentucky. He was a starting forward on the Wildcats' 1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game - winning team. As a freshman at Kentucky he was named SEC Tournament MVP. In his sophomore year, Walker was named All-SEC First, All-SEC Tournament and to the All-NCAA Regional Teams. Professional career Edit Boston Celtics Edit After Walker's sophomore season, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was picked sixth overall by the Boston Celtics. In the 1996--1997 season, Walker made the All-Rookie First Team and led the team in scoring (17.5 ppg) and rebounding (9.0), as the team had its worst season in franchise history, 15--67. The following season, Pitino was reunited with Walker as the new coach of the Celtics, and he made the All-Star team as a reserve while averaging 22.4 ppg and 10.2 rpg. He also scored a career-high 49 points in a loss against the Washington Wizards. In the '98 draft, the Celtics had the 10th pick and chose swing man Paul Pierce. The next few years, Pierce and Walker were the 1--2 punch for the Celtics. In the 2001--2002 season, Walker had his best overall season by helping lead the Celtics to a 49--33 record and their first playoff berth in seven years. He was second on his team in scoring (22.0), first in rebounds (9), and first in assists, (5.0). Pierce and Walker took the team to the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell to the New Jersey Nets in six games. The next season, Walker made his third All-Star team. On February 20, 2002, former Kentucky teammate Tony Delk was traded to the Celtics, reuniting Walker with him. Dallas Mavericks and Atlanta Hawks Edit Nine and one-half days before the start of the 2003--04 season, Walker was traded with Delk to the Dallas Mavericks for Raef LaFrentz, <mark>Chris Mills</mark>, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch. Walker was used in a relatively limited capacity on his new team due to the number of high-caliber players populating the Mavericks' roster. Included on that team was Antawn Jamison, newly acquired from the Golden State Warriors. On August 8, 2004 Walker and Delk were traded again, this time to the Atlanta Hawks for Jason Terry, longtime Hawk <mark>Alan Henderson</mark> and a draft pick. Return to Boston Edit On February 24, 2005, Walker was traded back to the Celtics in a deal that sent <mark>Gary Payton</mark>, Tom Gugliotta, <mark>Michael Stewart</mark>, and a first-round draft pick to the Hawks [1] (<mark>Payton</mark> was released by the Hawks and re-signed with Boston for the remainder of the season). Walker started all 24 remaining games for the Celtics, averaging 16.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a game as the Celtics advanced to the playoffs before losing to the Indiana Pacers in a 7-game first round series. Miami Heat Edit File: Antoine Walker Miami Heat. jpg On August 2, 2005, Walker was involved in a five-team, 13-player deal (the largest trade in NBA history) that sent him from the Celtics to the Miami Heat. The Celtics received Curtis Borchardt, Qyntel Woods, and a handful of draft picks in Walker's stead. The Heat played Walker mostly off the bench, and he rotated between both forward positions. Though he struggled early to adjust to this role, by the end of the season he was a force for the Heat, finishing the season with averages of 12.2 points and 5.1 rebounds a game as the team's main scorer off the bench. Walker also led the team in overall 3-point shots made for the season, and increased his 3-point, free throw and overall shooting percentages. In the playoffs his production would increase, as he would be the third leading scorer for the team while making crucial three-point baskets and posting 20 points in four different playoff games including 23 against the New Jersey Nets in the closing game of the conference semifinals. Miami advanced to the NBA Finals and faced the Dallas Mavericks, with Walker posting 13.8 points per game in the series as the Heat won the NBA championship in 6 games. In the title clinching sixth game in Dallas, Walker contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds. Walker's production dipped in the 2006--2007 season as he averaged 8.5 points a game and 4.3 rebounds. The Heat failed to repeat as champions following a first round loss to the Chicago Bulls. Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies Edit On October 24, 2007, Walker was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves along with Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, a first-round draft pick and cash considerations in exchange for <mark>Ricky Davis</mark> and <mark>Mark Blount</mark>. [2] [3] [4] On June 27, 2008, Walker was dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies along with Marko Jari\u0107, Greg Buckner, and the rights to O. J. Mayo, for <mark>Mike Miller</mark>, Brian Cardinal, <mark>Jason Collins</mark>, and the rights to <mark>Kevin Love</mark>. [5] After appearing in just two preseason games and remaining inactive throughout the opening months of the regular season, [6] he was waived by the Grizzlies on December 19, 2008. In February 2010, he signed with the Guaynabo Mets along with former Chicago Bulls player Marcus Fizer. [7] Walker was released on April 1, 2010. [8] On May 6, 2010, ESPN reported that Walker was trying to return to the NBA. [9] On December 7, 2010, Walker was acquired by Idaho Stampede of the NBA Development League. It was reported in April 2012 that Walker had announced his retirement after two years with the Stampede. [10] Personal life Edit File:20140614 Antoine Walker at the Nike Chi-League (1). JPG Walker was previously engaged to reality star Evelyn Lozada of Basketball Wives. Legal troubles Edit On January 5, 2009, Walker was arrested for driving under the influence in Miami Beach, Florida. [11] [12] On July 15, 2009, Walker was charged with three felony counts of writing bad checks related to gambling debts he had incurred at three Las Vegas casinos. [13] Walker was arrested on July 15 at Harrah's Casino in South Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The charges stemmed from over $800,000 in gambling debts. Walker was in South Lake Tahoe to play in the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic the following day. [14] On June 30, 2010, Walker entered a plea of not guilty on felony bad check charges stemming from his failure to pay $770,000 in gambling losses to Caesars Palace and two other casinos in Las Vegas, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. [15] A year later, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of passing a bad check. Under the plea agreement, he did not face a prison term, and was put on probation and worked towards repaying the debt. [16] Robberies Edit In July 2000, Walker and former University of Kentucky teammate Nazr Mohammed were robbed outside a South Side Chicago restaurant. [17] On July 9, 2007, Walker and another individual were robbed at gunpoint by two offenders in his own house. The assailants made off with close to $200,000 worth of merchandise, including Walker's Mercedes. His car was later recovered having been stripped of its expensive aftermarket wheels and stereo system. Four men were charged in this robbery and two of them were also linked to the similar robbery of fellow NBA player, Eddy Curry. [18] Bankruptcy Edit On May 18, 2010, Walker filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of Florida (Miami) as case number 10-23558 with total assets of $4.3 million and debts of $12.7 million. The filing listed four pieces of real estate including a $2.3 million Miami home that was underwater with a mortgage of $3.6 million, and three other properties in Chicago, one listed for $1.4 million. Nazr Mohammed paid half the fee of Walker's bankruptcy attorney. Walker's championship ring had to be sold off. In August 2013, Walker announced that he was debt-free. [19] Between 1996 and 2009, Walker earned more than $108 million from NBA salaries. [20] Broadcasting career Edit Walker is now a basketball analyst on 120 Sports. [21] Walker was also hired by SEC Network as a basketball analyst.

It's all in escapist good fun, of course. But, watching Stig Stigman (Wahlberg) and Bobby Trench (Washington) banter and back-slap their way through \"2 Guns,\" audiences may detect a whiff of anxiety beneath the bluster. Maybe it's director Baltasar Kormakur's habit of having his characters aim guns at each other's crotches or the increasingly frenetic (and laughable) escalation in firepower. But as the body count adds up in \"2 Guns,\" the inescapable impression is that the movie's pseudo-casual cool isn't entertainment as much as a cry for help. It's the same feeling that Anthony Weiner inspired this week as he tried to brazen his way through calls to exit the New York City mayoral race, with his compulsive exhibitionism outpaced only by his pathological ambition. Weiner's breathtaking braggadocio called to mind other instances of political posturing this summer, whether it was Rep. <mark>Steve King</mark>, R-Iowa, describing the children of undocumented immigrants as probable drug mules \"with calves the size of cantaloupes,\" or Congress spending this week avoiding substantive work, instead casting meaningless votes to score political points. Washington and Hollywood have always enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, with politicians looking westward for borrowed glamour and contributions, and the movie industry coming here for reflected gravitas and policy bona fides. But these days, the two cities share something else. Both are fear-based cultures whose once-invincible leaders are facing radical changes and imminent extinction. And they're coping with those threats, to use Gloria Steinem's famous phrase, with massive cases of self-induced testosterone poisoning. Facing diminishing domestic movie attendance, sliding DVD revenue and expanding international markets, Hollywood - never a courageous place - has become more risk-averse than ever. Few scripts are approved these days without big, fat valentines to a fanatic (the term of art is \"pre-sold\" ) audience, like comic-book fans or video gamers. With foreign markets now accounting for up to two-thirds of a film's revenue, dialogue is likely to consist of one or two catchphrases, with the bulk of communication occurring through gunplay, fireballs and car stunts that are understandable in any language. This summer has featured particularly bombastic examples of that formula. Even with recent hits like \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" and \"Bridesmaids\" - proving that grown-ups and women of all ages still go to movies - studio executives still cater to 14-year-old boys in their summer programming. But that strategy has proved wobbly, as bro-dacious spectacles like \"White House Down,\" \"The Lone Ranger\" and \"The Hangover Part III\" have gone limp at the box office. (The industry was reportedly gobsmacked when \"The Heat,\" a raunchy action comedy starring Sandra Bullock and <mark>Melissa McCarthy</mark>, turned out to be a sleeper hit .) For their part, politicians these days are also threatened, either by demographic shifts, primary challenges or their own self-destructive tendencies. Their rhetorical arms race, whether born of strategy or egomania, keeps escalating. But who's buying their lines? \"Quit isn't the way we roll in New York City,\" the chronically clueless - and thoroughly unconvincing - Weiner said in his new campaign videoTuesday. \"We fight through tough things. We're a tough city .\" Stig Stigman, meet Carlos Danger. Whether it's Wahlberg winking and blasting his way through \"2 Guns\" or Weiner arrogantly identifying himself with the city he seeks to lead (and that will surely reject him), both share an air of impunity that, to a far more troubling extent, suffuses the chilling documentary \"The Act of Killing .\" In the film, <mark>Joshua Oppenheimer</mark> interviews an Indonesian death squad leader named Anwar Congo, who reenacts the murders he committed in the 1960s as scenes from the pulp movies he idolized. Congo is so immersed in his own narcissistic myth that he's incapable of seeing the moral implications of his actions, which included torture, garroting and mass murders. It's not difficult to imagine Congo watching \"2 Guns\" and eagerly imitating Wahlberg and Washington's bravado, just as he'd almost certainly approve of - and maybe recognize himself in - Weiner's perverse, self-justifying defiance. To chalk up all this shootin' and shoutin' and brawlin' and braggin' simply to male ego would be glibly reductive, of course: Let it be noted, women buy plenty of tickets to these movies, too. But it's hard to believe that our current outbreak of testosterone poisoning - cinematic and political - isn't compensating for deeper insecurities. While studio executives desperately try to stay relevant by reverting to stereotypical male iconography, their counterparts on the political stage affect comical airs of cocky self-assurance and quien-es-mas-macho theatrics."}, {"articleID": "2012081611_00036417_W", "names": {"Craig Foster": ["Q48798475", "Q5180974", "Q925302"]}, "date": "2012-08-16", "url": "http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/english-premier-league/news/1116506/Fox-optimistic", "content": "\"no fear\" ...southampton's danny fox (getty images) danny fox is confident southampton will travel to manchester city for its premier league opener this weekend pressure-free and with \"no fear\". the 26-year-old left-back returned from a three-year international exile in scotland's 3-1 friendly win over australia at easter road this morning (aest), and will complete the turnaround in his career by travelling with top-flight new boys saints to take on the champions at etihad stadium. city is red-hot favourite to get its campaign off to a flier, but the former celtic and burnley defender insists nigel adkins' side will play in the same positive and carefree manner that won it promotion last season. \"everyone knows how good manchester city are, we watched them last week against chelsea in the community shield,\" he said. \"it will be a game where if we win everyone will be shocked and if we lose no one will be shocked .\" obviously we are going there as underdogs but it is a game we have to go into with no fear and play the way we have been taught to and hopefully we do ourselves proud. \"the gaffer installs that [no fear] in us at southampton. he wants us to play off the cuff and play with a bit of freedom, so hopefully we can do that and do ourselves proud and you never know what can happen .\" fox insists saints can take heart from the performances of last season's new boys to the premier league, swansea and norwich. \"we surprised a lot of people last season so i don't see any reason why we can't do it this season,\" he said. \"look at swansea and norwich last season, they surprised many teams, i remember seeing norwich going to <mark>craig foster</mark>: fozz on football (book) a fascinating book from respected football commentator, broadcaster and ex-socceroo <mark>craig foster</mark>., hitwise '09 #1 television program, hitwise"}, {"articleID": "2008092511_00014832_W", "names": {"President Bush": ["Q207", "Q23505"], "Raul Martinez": ["Q3421438", "Q3930834", "Q7299802", "Q7299805"]}, "date": "2008-09-25", "url": "http://local10.com/politics/17552987/detail.html?rss=mia&psp=news", "content": "truth test -

Proceeds from the event will benefit the Wee Folk Scholarship fund. Advertisement Now that Kansas basketball coach Bill Self has been elected president (of the National Association of College Basketball Coaches), what exactly does that mean to the state of college basketball? Well, look for some changes. For one thing, expect Self to turn into a tweeting fool at 3 a.m. Also, his skin will turn as orange as the Syracuse mascot and he will become Self-obsessed. President Self intends to build a wall around the KU campus so that when recruits visit, they won't be able to leave. They'll have no choice but to sign with the Jayhawks. And get this: He's going to get Kentucky coach John Calipari to pay for it. \"Trust me,\" he'll tweet at 3 a.m., \"Cal's footing the bill .\" President Self will see to it that every recruit who signs with either Duke or Kentucky is deported immediately. The fans have been known to raise the roof, figuratively, at Allen Fieldhouse. President Self will raise the roof literally because he is going to transform the field house into a massive tower: Self Tower. Self will proclaim the media \"the enemy of the American people\" and will send Chris Theisen to handle press briefings, but still will make appearances on \"the shows .\" On those shows, when asked how he'll go about devising a strategy for winning a 14th consecutive Big 12 title, Self will answer, \"From watching the General on the shows .\" Presumably, that will mean <mark>Bob Knight</mark>, who sadly no longer is on the shows much these days. President Self will do much of his work on the golf course, where his big hands will come in handy driving the ball 280-yards-plus. Self's term as president of the NABC might seem like an eternity, but will last just two years. President Self's vice president's first name is Mike and his last name is one syllable, Brey (Notre Dame). He will develop derogatory pet nicknames for opponents and won't even spare past NABC presidents. He'll refer to the Michigan State coach as \"Little Izzo .\" Henceforth, Self will refer to referee Ted Valentine as \"Lyin' Ted .\" Self is the third Kansas basketball coach to become president of the NABC. Phog Allen (1927-29) was the first and <mark>Roy Williams</mark> (2001-02) also filled the office that commands respect. Advisers will remind the president to conduct himself with the type of dignity associated with the lofty office. They'll do their best to keep him from tweeting at 3 a.m., but their best advice won't stand a chance against such a powerful urge. They'll lose that battle and he'll call them losers."}, {"articleID": "2019062611_00088748_W", "names": {"John Mcenroe": ["Q16474", "Q37772659"], "Andy Murray": ["Q10125", "Q526811"]}, "date": "2019-06-26", "url": "http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/sport/national/17731142.john-mcenroe-cautious-over-andy-murray-singles-return/", "content": "<mark>John McEnroe</mark> cautious over <mark>Andy Murray</mark> singles return By Press Association 2019 <mark>Andy Murray</mark>, right, and Feliciano Lopez won the doubles title at Queen's Club 0 comment <mark>John McEnroe</mark> remains cautious about <mark>Andy Murray</mark>'s hopes of a successful singles comeback.

Best of five (sets) is totally different than best of three .\" But it was nice to see him eager and into it and looking like he was relatively healthy. You can't really determine it until he starts playing singles matches and how the body reacts if you're on a hard court, for example, as opposed to grass. \"It looked very promising, which is great, and I think everyone wants him to be able to come back and then be able to retire on his own terms .\" <mark>Murray</mark> has not yet put himself through the physical rigours of singles (Steven Paston/PA) In <mark>Murray</mark>'s absence from singles, British hopes of a title challenger rest with Johanna Konta following her surprise run to the French Open semi-finals. American great Chris Evert declared herself speechless at Konta's performance in her quarter-final victory over Sloane Stephens, but the British number one was ultimately disappointing in a semi-final loss to Marketa Vondrousova where her old problems with nerves resurfaced. \"I was calling a match at the French, and she could have won the tournament the way she played, and then I see her play a match where she could have lost to almost anybody,\" said Evert. \"I think she's still a work in progress with the mental side of the game, but I think she's working really hard at it. Just the way she's wired, she has to work a little bit more on taking the emotion out of the game and just being fully focused .\" Johanna Konta struggled to hold herself together mentally in her French Open semi-final (Richard Sellers/PA) In the women's tournament, a lot of focus will again be on the form of Serena Williams as she continues her pursuit of Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles. The American reached the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open last year but this season has been disappointing, with the 37-year-old hampered by a knee problem and desperately short of matches. Williams did not follow through with her suggestion that she might play a warm-up tournament and arrives at the All England Club having completed just six matches since January. Evert feels Williams made a mistake not playing in Birmingham or Eastbourne, saying: \"I think definitely she should have done, just so she can gauge where she is on the grass and what she needs to work on.

I would have said in January, if there was any grand slam she was going to win, it would probably be Wimbledon, and I just think with her game, she just loves hitting the ball.

These tax refunds are from 2015, and they belong to about 1.2 million taxpayers who didn't file a return that year, according to the IRS.

There is no penalty for submitting a late return if you're due a refund. The IRS isn't as kind to late filers with balances due; those taxpayers are on the hook for penalties. Who needs to file \u00a9 Provided by CNBC LLC The Internal Revenue Services offices in Washington, D.C. Generally, once your income reaches a certain level, you need to file. For the 2018 tax year, single filers under 65 are required to submit a return if their gross income was at least $12,000. For married couples under 65, the threshold is $24,000. If you're 65 and over, you'll need to file if your gross income is at least $13,600. That number goes up to $25,300 for married couples if one spouse is over 65, and $26,600 if both are at least that age. Your dependents aren't necessarily off the hook for filing, either. Whether your kids must file a return will depend on whether they had earned or unearned income. For 2018, single dependents under age 65 must file a return if they had unearned income--that is, income from taxable interest, dividends and capital gains--over $1,050, according to the IRS. They must also file a return if their earned income--money from salaries, wages, and tips--exceeds $12,000. When filing pays \u00a9 Provided by CNBC LLC Just because you don't have to file, doesn't mean you should skip it. For instance, low-income filers might be eligible for the earned income tax credit. This tax break is more generous for families: Filers with no kids can get a maximum credit of $519 for the 2018 tax year, but the break goes up to $6,431 for taxpayers with 3 or more kids. The catch is that you need to file your return in order to claim the credit. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. Read More"}]
