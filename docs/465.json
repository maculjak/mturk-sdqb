On Friday morning, the CBS board of directors announced that it will investigate sexual misconduct claims made against Les Moonves, the network's C.E.O. \"All allegations of personal misconduct are to be taken seriously,\" the board stated in a press release. \"The Independent Directors of CBS have committed to investigating claims that violate the Company's clear policies in that regard. Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the Board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action .\" The announcement arrived hours before The New Yorker was reportedly set to publish an expos\u00e9 from Ronan Farrow, the Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist whose reporting on Harvey Weinstein helped fell the Hollywood mogul and crystalize the current Time's Up and #MeToo movements. Farrow's forthcoming report, according to The Hollywood Reporter, is said to accuse Moonves of \"unwanted kissing and touching that occurred more than 20 years ago, as well as numerous claims that occurred more recently .\" (The CBS board's statement did not mention Moonves by name, but did reference a pending New Yorker article .) CBS also noted the timing of the new claims--as arriving \"in the midst of the Company's very public legal dispute .\" This past May, Vanity Fair's William D. Cohan reported that the battle between Moonves and Shari Redstone, whose family currently controls both CBS and Viacom, for command over the network had gone \"nuclear\" --with CBS attempting to wrest voting power away from the Redstones. Shari, the heir apparent to father Sumner Redstone's media kingdom, has been hoping to merge the companies that her father split into two publicly traded corporations. Moonves and the CBS board sued Shari in hopes of preventing the merger. The suit is set to be argued in court in October.

NSW Waratahs coach Daryl Gibson says there's every indication his superstar back Israel Folau is happy at the Super Rugby club and he's also backed captain <mark>Michael Hooper</mark> to be fit for Australia's first Rugby Championship game. Australia's representation in the Super Rugby competition ended last weekend when the Waratahs lost their semi-final to the Lions in Johannesburg. With teams travelling overseas in the finals disadvantaged, Gibson liked the idea of having a break during the series, along the lines of the NFL, where there is a week off before the Superbowl. NSW arrived home on Monday, with their established Test stars not having to go into the Wallabies camp until Sunday. Gibson expected some of their other players on the fringe of the Wallabies squad to get a run in Friday's trial game in Sydney. Speculation has surrounded Folau's future, with suggestions he could head to Queensland, though Gibson remained hopeful the star back would stick with the Tahs \"Obviously a lot of those negotiations are with Rugby Australia, but certainly every indication is that Israel is really happy here,\" said Gibson, who is soon expected to re-sign as head coach for another two years.

The views of charity and social enterprise bosses have been revealed in the latest Ulster Bank and CO3 3rd Sector Index. Published by CO3 Chief Officers 3rd Sector, the report is a key barometer of Northern Ireland's third sector, involving a quarterly survey of CO3 members, who include the leaders of some of Northern Ireland's largest charities and social enterprises. Services they provide range from care, to counselling and support, as well as training and development. A total of 65% of respondents believe that political instability in Northern Ireland will worsen over the year ahead and almost two-thirds expect the Northern Ireland economy to deteriorate over the same period, an increase on the previous quarter (61%). As fears for the economy and political instability continue, almost three quarters (72%) of third sector leaders advocate for a shift in the political decision-making process. While opinion is mixed, only 24% believe in maintaining the status quo, opting for civil servants to make decisions about Northern Ireland in the absence of a Stormont Executive. Overall, third sector leaders believe the responsibility for making decisions about Northern Ireland should fall with the Secretary of State (27%), a joint British-Irish intergovernmental conference (25%) or a Citizens' Assembly (20%). One respondent to the survey said: \"Having no decision makers, having no decisions being made, having civil servants who are afraid to commission anything new and being stuck in contracts that are out of date, under paying us and undervaluing us is frustrating and leaving us unable to have much flexibility in responding to the needs of our groups .\" Despite the uncertain environment though, respondents say that their organisations continue to increase employment and remain optimistic that turnover will increase. The latest report shows an increase in employment levels to deal with an increasing demand for services, with 33% of organisations increasing their headcount in the past quarter, the highest rate of increase over the previous 12 months. This comes as organisations are once again reporting continued increases in demand for their services (67%). As a result, 74% expect their turnover to increase or remain the same. Nora Smith, Chief Executive of CO3, said: \"Once again, the political situation in Northern Ireland remains a key concern for third sector organisations and one which they don't expect to improve. Our latest report demonstrates that the lack of a government is impacting on the sector however the resilience of organisations is also apparent. What is clear is that the third sector needs government decisions to be made and the majority feel that the current situation where decisions aren't being made is unsustainable .\" <mark>Richard Ramsey</mark>, Chief Economist, NI, at Ulster Bank added: \"Despite no shortage of political uncertainty, the Northern Ireland economy has been resilient in the past year, with private sector activity continuing to increase and labour market statistics posting a number of records of the positive variety. The latest Ulster Bank and CO3 Third Sector Index suggests that this is being reflected in the third sector where despite issues being created by a lack of decision-making including in relation to funding, third sector organisations report that they are seeing growing demand and are increasing their headcount. Whether this is sustainable in a situation where political stalemate continues and the economy as a whole feels the increasing squeeze of rising inflation and stagnant wages remains to be seen .\" (MH/LM) Charity Leaders Raise Concerns Over Ongoing Political Instability Charities and social enterprises in Northern Ireland are concerned about politically instability and believe action is needed to ensure decisions can be made in the absence of an Executive.

Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints .\" The tweet, seemingly in response to a VICE News article posted last week, uses the phrase \"shadow banning,\" a term that has been co-opted by conspiracy theorists who say that Silicon Valley is discriminating against them. Since the early days of the web, a \"shadow ban\" has been a moderation technique used to ban people from forums or message boards without alerting them that they've been banned. Typically, this means that a user can continue posting as normal, but their posts will be hidden from the rest of the community. In this case, Twitter made changes to how it ranks its search results for accounts from what it considers to be \"bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or divide the conversation,\" the company said. Twitter also had a bug that caused some accounts to not be auto-suggested in search results even when people were searching for their names. That means users couldn't see Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich's account in their search results, but Twitter says that hundreds of thousands of accounts were impacted by this issue, and that it didn't impact users based on their political affiliation. The bug didn't prevent affected users' tweets from being seen or interacted with, but some conservatives still called it a Twitter \"shadow ban .\" Twitter says the bug was just that--a bug, which has since been fixed. But \"shadow banning\" continues to be a digital bogeyman, used to shoo away the nuances of social media platforms' increasingly complicated (and often opaque) content moderation strategies. The term has been used by Ted Cruz and Project Veritas's James O\u2019Keefe to suggest an anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley, and the term itself has recently become part of conspiracy theorists' vocabularies, much like \"crisis actor\" and \"the deep state .\" And while the term refers to a real and commonly implemented moderation technique used on countless internet forums over the years, using the term now often says something about a person's political beliefs. Shadow banning sounds nefarious, but the term has a much less controversial origin that I spent the last few days tracking down. Toading and Twit Bits Before there were \"shadow bans,\" there was \"toading .\" Early internet anthropologist and Motherboard contributor Claire Evans told me that a practice similar to shadow banning--not exactly a ban, but more of a muting--was happening on multi-user domains (MUDs), text-based Dungeons and Dragons - like chat rooms that were popular as early as the 70s. MUD users had \"toading,\" which was \"the act of metaphorically turning someone into a\" toad' as a punitive measure, \"Evans told me in an email. Toading someone removed\" the flag by which the system recognizes the player-object as a player, \"according to Yib's Guide to MOOing. This effectively made the player invisible to the system and other players .\" Another version of toading was kind of the opposite, moving the player to a public space in the game in order to humiliate them, \"Evans, the author of Broad Band said .\" Sunlight is the best antiseptic, etc. \"Read more: The Secret History of a Fleeting Pre-Internet Digital Media Channel Other shadow ban-like moderation tools evolved in the 1980s and 1990s. According to The Telecommunications Illustrated Dictionary, many bulletin board systems (BBS) server access control lists in the 80s (like mod privileges, but for everyone on your server) included flags for each user that admins could toggle individually, granting users access to things like chat, email, or downloads in the BBS. One of these flags was an early version of a shadow ban: The\" twit bit' is a flag that basically labels a user as a \"loser,\" in BBS parlance. In other words, the twit is someone who has been flagged for limited access because s/he exhibits immature behavior and can't be trusted with access to any of the powerful features. In this very thorough Metafilter thread users agree that the earliest concept of shadowbanning came from Citadel-derived BBS servers. User ricochet biscuit wrote: \"It was easy then to create a forum on a topic that would enrage a known troll and just set it so the only users who could see it were the troll and myself. I would post a single item and then watch him try to rabble-rouse and wonder aloud why no one was taking the bait .\" Someone claiming to be a former systems administrator of a Citadel BBS board said on the forum Simple Machine that they remember a feature called \"coventry,\" named after the idiom for ostracizing someone. Admins could set a coventry \"bit\" on a user and their messages, so that if they did happen to add something worthwhile to the conversation, individual messages could be taken out of coventry, so to speak. \"Most of the time, such users would get increasingly worse for a short period of time, then never come back again,\" user labradors wrote. \"In some cases, though, they realised that nobody would respond to their rants--only their helpful messages, and they would quiet down to become good, productive members of the board .\" Kill Files, * plonk * and MUDs At the same time BBS users were sending people out to coventry, people on Usenet newsgroups were managing their feeds with personalized filters. Philip Greenspun, an early internet entrepreneur and pioneer of online communities, alluded to a similar feature in 80s Usenet servers. Back then, \"it was possible to establish a\" bozo filter' to screen out messages from posters with a track record of being uninteresting, \"he wrote on his blog. Read more: Ten Years of' 2 Girls 1 Cup,' the Most Memorable Brazilian Shit on the Internet I asked Seth Morabito--a Unix programmer who worked at one of the biggest Silicon Valley startups in the 90s and has spent a lot of time in then-obscure online communities--whether he recalled seeing anything like a shadow ban on the forums he frequented. He told me in an email that the closest he could think of happened on Usenet newsgroups, where a decentralized conversation could take place. What he described sounds kind of like the\" bozo filter. \"If you were in a flame war, or if you were just acting like an asshole, you could be added to other another user's\" kill file. \"The kill file let users create a list of usernames and keywords they no longer wanted to see (similar to\" muting \"on Twitter .)\" People being people, folks very rarely put anyone into their kill file without letting the target KNOW that they were being put into a kill file, \"Morabito said. It became tradition to reply to the victim with a single word: * plonk, * surrounded by asterisks .\" It was more or less public shaming, letting both the target and the rest of the newsgroup know that your buttons had been pushed so hard that you were just going to outright ignore the troublemaker forever more, \"he said. The\" Shadow Ban \"Like so much other modern internet lingo, the\" shadow ban \"seems to have come from the humor website and forums Something Awful. Rich Kyanka, the creator of Something Awful, says that the site that spawned\" weird Twitter \"coined ubiquitous internet terminology including\" banhammer, \"\"spoiler alert,\" \"let's play,\" and \"AMA .\" (Ask Me Anything). He also says that Something Awful mods invented the term \"shadow ban\" in 2001. \"We would use it as a joke and only do it to people who were intentionally trying to troll others,\" Kyanka, who is regular-banned from Twitter these days, told me in an email. \"None of the moderators used it very often, and we got rid of it within a year, replacing it with simply banning the person .\" The banned user could easily tell if they were shadowbanned by logging out of their account and looking for their own posts. Kyanka is banned from Twitter for making jokes that the platform deemed against its community guidelines. Some of those jokes include telling far-right personality Baked Alaska that he \"should go to a room and the room should fill full of concrete,\" which Twitter deemed a death threat, and telling Nancy Pelosi to \"eat the children,\" which the platform considered hate speech. The term shadow banning has persisted in internet forums and subreddits until today. Message boards still have functionalities like this, including vbulletin's \"global ignore\" which adds a user to every other user's ignore list. There's a subreddit dedicated to figuring out whether you've been shadow banned, where a bot will give you the verdict. But even though platforms like Twitter claim they don't shadow ban users, there are still people who blame their voices not being heard on this real feature of other internet communities. The Birth of a Conspiracy Theory The idea that Silicon Valley giants use shadow banning to silence conservatives was popularized by far right publications over the last two years. In 2016, Breitbart published a story claiming that Twitter shadow banning is \"real and happening every day,\" citing a source inside the company. In January, Project Veritas published a selectively edited video of a former Twitter software engineer who explained the concept of shadow banning and how Twitter was using it. Sen. Ted Cruz repeated the claim from Project Veritas during a Senate hearing with Twitter's director of public policy Carlos Monje, who denied that Twitter was shadow banning users. In a blog post published Thursday, Twitter said unequivocally: \"We do not shadow ban .\" In the early days of the web, online communities were small, fractured, and came up with different ways to police themselves, which is why we have all these different, interesting terms like toading and kill files. Today, platforms like Twitter have to moderate millions of people--billions, in Facebook's case. Because of this scale, content moderation is significantly different. Moderators are rarely members of the communities they're moderating and are instead people who are paid to action content that is reported by users for violating a platform's rules or content that is surfaced by algorithms. Read more: How r/the _ <mark>donald</mark> Became a Melting Pot of Frustration and Hate The types of actions that can be taken against content are also far more sophisticated. Because very few social media sites use reverse-chronological timelines anymore, every piece of content is \"moderated\" automatically by a platform's algorithm in some way, making it more - or less-likely to show up in users' feeds. Though Facebook and Twitter can and do delete content and ban users for violating their rules, they also have more nuanced ways of moderating content that they believe to be problematic. In the case of Holocaust denial for example, Facebook will sometimes \"significantly reduce the distribution of content\" rather than outright ban it. Part of the current confusion about shadow banning is happening because conspiracy theorists are trying to prove an anti-conservative bias from some of the world's most powerful companies, and \"shadow banning\" sounds scary. But not all of this confusion is in bad faith: Social media companies have traditionally been terrible at explaining how they do moderate, and its timeline algorithms and rule-making processes are all black boxes that have not been sufficiently explained to the public. In fact, last month, the special rapporteur to the United Nations's Human Rights Council issued a 20-page report noting that social media companies \"must embark on radically different approaches to transparency at all stages of their operations, from rule-making to implementation and development of\" case law \"framing the interpretation of private rules .\" It would be a lot cleaner and easier to explain away why people aren't engaging with your social media posts on a platform purposefully deciding it wants to censor you, but the fact is that algorithms are making a lot of the decisions about what people see and don't see. Content moderation simply isn't as straightforward these days. \"I'd say one of the key advantages the old-school Internet has over today's platforms is that it you were much more likely to just get booted from a community if you didn't follow the rules,\" Evans said.
