(fantasy confessional: i drafted ramirez in the three-spot last season and finished near the basement of our experts league). perhaps that's clouding my judgment a bit. <mark>rodriguez</mark> no doubt is in the best lineup, but he's in the highest pressure situation of his career, possibly of all time. imagine how hard the new york press will dog a-rod if he goes 2-for-21 in the first week of april...i.e., \"<mark>alex</mark>, do you think the ball goes over the fence if you get another injection from your cousin? can madonna help?\" i'm just not in love with <mark>rodriguez</mark> as the top pick. in fact, i want to go out on a limb and say <mark>rodriguez</mark> could have his string of 11 straight 30-homer seasons snapped in' 09. i'm not comfortable with that assessment just yet. comfort comes with pujols. he has heavy hitters around him in ryan ludwick and rick ankiel. those two players averaged 31 homers and 92 rbis last season. pujols will hit 30 homers for the ninth straight season. that i can say with near-100 percent confidence. there's only one minor pang of guilt with drafting pujols. that is, you can plainly see i was able to scoop up san diego's adrian gonzalez three rounds later. having two sweet-swinging first basemen is cool. having <mark>rodriguez</mark> and gonzalez and perhaps <mark>chris davis</mark> as a corner infielder might have been the better strategy, however. but i'm not that worried. having pujols 30 seconds into the draft tends to alleviate a lot of those concerns. fantasy source fastball, written by fantasy source editors, provide timely and quick-hitting analysis of the day's news.", "articleID": "2009021900_00005661_W", "names": {"Chris Davis": ["Q1046188", "Q16233084", "Q27832670", "Q3675473", "Q42029773", "Q50658732", "Q5106363", "Q5106364", "Q5106366", "Q5106367", "Q5106368", "Q55127593"], "David Wright": ["Q1173399", "Q16217703", "Q21288738", "Q21453256", "Q22122541", "Q260844", "Q2631275", "Q29643824", "Q42323023", "Q45305146", "Q47353608", "Q5241306", "Q5241307", "Q5241308", "Q5241312", "Q5241313", "Q5241314", "Q54675733", "Q57697274", "Q57893530", "Q684849"]}}, {"date": "2009-02-20", "url": "http://sunherald.com/local/story/1152404.html", "content": "washington - mississippi lawmakers are seeing the world this presidents' day break, with republican sen. roger wicker off on a congressional delegation visit to israel, syria and austria and democrat rep. <mark>gene taylor</mark> already back from a visit to colombia. wicker, a new member of the senate foreign relations committee, joined delegation leader sen. ben cardin, d-md., chairman of the commission on security and cooperation in europe, and six other lawmakers on the seven-day trip that ends saturday. another lawmaker, commission co-chairman rep. alcee hastings, d-fla., was to join the group in vienna. \"the focus of the trip will be on u.s-israeli bilateral relations, including cooperation in addressing military and security issues, as well as the political and social situation in the palestinian territories,\" the release said. next stop: syria, where the delegation was to meet in damascus with syrian president bashar al-assad and foreign minister walid mualem. they were also expected to visit a united nations high commissioner for refugees facility in damascus to learn more about the status of iraqi refugees in syria. finally, on to vienna, where the lawmakers will attend the 8th annual winter meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe's parliamentary assembly. \"during the meeting, chairman cardin will deliver a statement on president obama's intention to close the guantanamo bay detention facility and on other related issues,\" said the commission, also known as the helsinki commission, in its release. <mark>taylor</mark> has had a long-time interest in u.s. military presence in central and south america, said stephen peranich, <mark>taylor</mark>'s chief of staff. <mark>taylor</mark> is chairman of the house armed services committee's seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee. <mark>taylor</mark> was in colombia for several days and returned this week and immediately met another congressional delegation touring shipyards. <mark>taylor</mark> met rep. todd akin, r-mo., the new ranking member of the seapower subcommittee, at austal shipyard in mobile on thursday and continued to northrop grumman's ingalls shipyard in pascagoula.", "articleID": "2009022006_00009148_W", "names": {"Gene Taylor": ["Q3497826", "Q452955", "Q55061542", "Q5531493"]}}, {"date": "2009-02-22", "url": "http://nbcchicago.com/sports/football/Kurt-Warner-Is-Not-Out-Of-The-Picture.html", "content": "how good would warner be if instead of boldin and fitzgerald he had hester and, uh, whoever else the bears trot out there?
