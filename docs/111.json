[{"date": "2011-05-26", "url": "http://nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2011/05/progress_in_standarized_tests.html", "content": "public school students in most of the metro area continue to make strides on standardized tests, according to scores released this week, with the recovery school district schools in new orleans posting the largest gains. rusty costanza, the times-picayune archive students at william fischer charter school in algiers participate in a leap test rally in april. that's strong evidence that the transformation of the city's public schools after hurricane katrina continues to yield results. education officials at the state and local level need to continue pushing in that direction and fend off efforts to erode reforms. students across most of our area showed progress, although large discrepancies exist between districts. the top average performance came from students in the 16 schools that remain under the orleans parish school board. that's hardly surprising, as the board in 2005 kept only schools that were not failing before the storm and several of those campuses are magnet schools with admissions requirements. overall, schools in st. tammany, plaquemines, st. bernard and st. charles parishes continued to perform near or above the state averages in most results of the state leap, ileap and graduate exit exams administered this spring. some parishes were significantly better than the state's figure. but not all students saw gains from last year. st. tammany has performed well above the state's average for several years and saw gains in all areas, except the graduate exit exam taken by students in 10th and 11th grades. those results actually dipped a bit from last spring, and officials need to focus on maintaining gains and improving performance across the board. state officials highlighted the gains recorded in st. bernard in recent years. since 2007, the percentage of st. bernard students scoring at \"basic\" proficiency--essentially at grade level--or above has risen 17 percent. that's an impressive gain. but the largest gains overall came among the new orleans schools the state took over after katrina because of their historic poor performance. most of those schools are now independent charters overseen by the rsd, which also runs a number of traditional schools. rsd students, including charter and traditional campuses, posted their fourth-consecutive year of improvement, increasing the proportion of students scoring at grade level or above to 48 percent. that's a 5 percent gain compared to 2010. with that progress, the proportion of rsd students scoring at grade level or better has more than doubled since 2007, from 23 percent to 48 percent. the numbers reflect the progress sparked by the wholesale reform of the system after katrina. the district still has substantial ground to cover to raise its overall performance to the state average. but the progress since katrina would have been unthinkable without the reforms. the track record of the system in recent years--including these latest scores--should stymie efforts by some teacher unions and other critics of charter schools to erode reforms the rsd is not perfect, and it needs to address inequities between individual schools. the system also needs to focus on improving performance among new orleans schools that are still well below the state average. that's particularly true for high schools still run directly by the rsd. rsd superintendent <mark>john white</mark> said the results show the district is a national model for broader education reform efforts. \"the new orleans system of schools works. period. end of story. and we cannot go back to a system that does not put children's needs first .\" he said. \"these results should close the book on that question .\" mr. <mark>white</mark> is right. new orleans' results also show that officials in jefferson parish must accelerate their push for reform. jefferson schools, which now rank 52nd out of 70 public school systems in louisiana, posted gains in five of seven grade levels that take the standardized tests. but jefferson still remained well below the state's average and also had a dismaying 21 percent drop from last year's scores in the gee. that's unacceptable for one of the largest and richest public school systems in the state. \"we cannot be complacent, satisfied or celebratory,\" deputy superintendent <mark>richard carpenter</mark> said of the results. indeed. the message jefferson officials should draw from these results is that they should pursue reform as vigorously as their rsd counterparts have done in new orleans. and even the school systems with the best scores in the region need to continue working to improve.",

and liberal pundits have decided it is political kryptonite that will fatally weaken the gop. their evidence is tuesday's special election in new york's 26th district, where democrat kathy hochul defeated republican jane corwin for a vacant congressional seat. this is not just any congressional district, but one carried by george w. bush and john mccain in the last two presidential elections, and one represented for 58 years by a republican. liberals can barely contain their glee. msnbc's ed schultz said the outcome left \"republicans scrambling\" while the washington post's e.j. dionne said \"it will petrify\" republicans. sen. patty murray (d-wa .) said it proved \"democrats have the keys to drive the budget debate and play offense in 2012 .\" most, but not all, of this is wishful thinking. ms. hochul won a plurality (47%) of the votes, not a majority, getting only one percentage point more than barack obama as he was losing the district in 2008. not exactly a compelling performance. democrats won only because a third-party candidate-self-proclaimed tea partier <mark>jack davis</mark> - spent a reported $3 million of his own money. absent mr. davis as a spoiler-he got 9% of the vote-democrats would never have made a serious bid for this district, nor won if they did. ironically, mr. davis ran for the same seat in the last three elections as a democrat. this year he ran as a populist conservative. still the question remains: did the medicare reforms proposed by house budget committee chairman <mark>paul ryan</mark> and supported by ms. corwin play a role in the outcome? the answer is yes, though not with the blunt force and trauma some democrats are claiming. karl rove is a former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to president george w. bush. he is a

eventually became pdx summer school, a program that offers individualized tutoring to low-income, esl students at harrison park school. for most students, summer is a time of fun and relaxation away from school, but for others, summer can be a time to fall behind. that's especially true for students in low-income, non-english-speaking households, who might not only forget their multiplication tables but also the language that's key to learning everything else. it's a problem that tim schulze, a fifth-grade teacher at harrison park school, hopes to address with his newly formed nonprofit, pdx summer school, a monthlong tutoring program for low-income esl students. at a recent fundraiser, schulze raised more than $1,500 for the program, in addition to a equity foundation grant. \"these kids, because they're learning two languages, have a lot of work to do,\" he said, adding that problems learning english can affect all elements of learning. \"it becomes that they feel that they can't succeed at school .\" the program, which will run alongside the school's summer programs, will provide individualized tutoring to 32 esl students nominated by teachers for extra help over the summer. the students will get a chance to work on learning english along with other basic subjects, with the goal of building their confidence. \"so many of these kids are beaten down, they're told,\" nope,' they don't pass, \"he said .\" we want to give these kids not only an academic boost, but also a self-esteem and confidence boost. \"the program was born out of schulze's experience at mill

them to get out and stay excited about learning .\" that's what pdx summer school is about, \"schulze said .\" to give them that confidence boost going into the fall. \"pdx summer school is looking for four teachers to tutor groups of students during the july session. they're also hunting for donations to expand the program to include more children at different schools.", "articleID":

wednesday's announcement of an october super fight between ufc welterweight champion georges st-pierre (22-2 mma, 16-2 ufc) and strikeforce titleholder nick diaz (25-7 mma, 6-4 ufc), st-pierre opened as a healthy -365 favorite. that means st-pierre was given nearly an 80 percent chance of winning the fight. but as noted mma oddsmaker joey oddessa told mmajunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com), the bettors' early money is coming in for diaz, and his underdog status could continue to diminish as the fight draws near. the pay-per-view title fight, which appears to be just for the ufc belt (though officials haven't clarified), takes place oct. 29 at the mandalay bay events center in las vegas. it's the first major ufc vs. strikeforce fight since ufc officials purchased their rival promotion in march. oddessa said some early, pre-announcement lines had st-pierre as much as a -450 favorite. however, that line was based on the belief that the fight would take place in st-pierre's home country of canada, part of a planned december show in montreal. now that it's officially slated for sin city, diaz is considered less of an underdog. and it's a trend that could continue. \"in the early hours after i opened (st-pierre) at -365, i saw a steady flow of support come in on nick diaz,\" said oddessa, who frequently appears on mmajunkie.com radio to preview fights and discuss betting lines. \"the line has been down to -340, and it's likely to continue its steady flow toward nick diaz if his strong fan base continues to bet rapid fire on the emotion and anticipation of nick's return to the ufc .\" with all the recent fight cancellations, bettors usually don't care to tie up money on future bouts unless they anticipate fairly large swings in the odds. the early money on diaz may be a strong indicator of where the betting line is headed. \"oddessa, who's the brain behind some of mma's most widely used betting lines, said this is somewhat unchartered territory for diaz. since leaving the ufc in april 2006, he's posted a 14-1 record in organizations such as pride, elitexc, strikeforce and dream. outside of a pride 33 meeting with takanori gomi that ended in victory (but was later changed to a no-contest due to a failed drug test), diaz has been an underdog just once: against frank shamrock in 2009. (diaz, of course, won that fight .) st-pierre, too, is used to the\" favorite \"status .\" nick diaz and george st-pierre have entered the ring and cage all but one time as the betting favorites dating back over five years, \"oddessa said .\" over that time period of a combined near 25 bouts, the average price on diaz and st-pierre in each outing was higher than -375, and more than often, most gamblers referred to each as the \"lock' on the card .\" white on \"tuf\" talk, pettis' future, edgar-maynard iii, lesnar's health, aldo, dark-era dvds white: champ st-pierre isn't fighting at ufc 140 in montreal, next challenger not set boxing promoter chargin: george st-pierre vs. nick diaz targeted for december promoter says nick diaz no longer set to box, dana white insists ufc bout not guaranteed poll result: which potential ufc vs. strikeforce matchup intrigues you the most? press release announces nick diaz to box jeff lacy, manager says gsp fight still possible cesar gracie: \"ultimate risk-taker\" nick diaz perfect for gsp -
