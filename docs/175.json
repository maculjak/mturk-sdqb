Check out the latest buzz below. Kobe Says Lakers Still Getting in Shape Kobe Bryant said after the rough 116-75 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday that the Lakers have been working hard and may have been worn down. \"Kobe says everyone has pretty heavy legs right now, says they've been practicing really hard,\" reported Lakers Nation Serena Winters. \"We practice really, really hard .\" But Kobe believes that the team will be fine once the regular season starts. \"We haven't started tapering down yet,\" he said, reported Lakers reporter Mike Trudell. \"T hinks guys will be more fresh ahead of the regular season. Focus now has been work,\" Trudell said, paraphrasing Bryant. Bryant also praised the Warriors, who he said are an excellent team.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) The Warriors have until October 31 to extend Klay Thompson. If not, he becomes a restricted free agent next summer. fan website claims that the Lakers will target Thompson if the contract talks don't work out. The Lakers have expressed interest in Thompson before. The shooting guard had Kobe raving after the first preseason game between the two, saying\" He has the whole package. \"And the Lakers tried to pull off a trade for Thompson earlier this year before the NBA draft. Los Angeles Times said that the Lakers wanted to deal the seventh pick in the draft, which became Julius Randle, for Thompson as part of a three-way trade that would have also involved the Minnesota Timberwolves and <mark>Kevin Love</mark>. The T'Wolves later traded <mark>Love</mark> to the Cleveland Cavaliers for multiple players. <mark>Nash</mark> Injured? <mark>Steve Nash</mark>, the oldest player in the NBA, informed coach Byron Scott that he didn't feel good on Sunday night. <mark>Nash</mark>, 40, asked Scott to take him out of the game .\" Byron Scott said <mark>Steve Nash</mark> told him he was done for the night, said he just didn't feel right, \"Winters said. <mark>Nash</mark>, like Bryant, has dealt with injuries over the last couple seasons. But both have been practicing hard and appeared to be ready for the season.

Both sat out the game against the Warriors, along with Xavier Henry, <mark>Ryan Kelly</mark>, <mark>Ed Davis</mark>, and <mark>Nick Young</mark>. Ronnie Price and Keith Appling are the other point guards currently on the roster. Clarkson will be out until Friday, at least.

Some believe that Lin should be starting over <mark>Nash</mark>, but it may come to whichever guard is in better condition to start the season .\" In early exhibition you want to see as many guys as you can, \"Scott said .\" Unfortunately for Jeremy, and obviously for <mark>Nick</mark>, it gives other guys an opportunity. \"Scott said that Lin should be ready to play on Thursday against the Utah Jazz. reported ESPN .\" But today he was walking a little gingerly and did some more treatment today. \"Prediction Has Lakers Missing Playoffs A number of season predictions have been coming out and the latest has the Lakers missing the playoffs .\" If everything were to go perfectly for the Lakers this season, it would still be tough to envision a win total of more than 45 games - and even then, that probably wouldn't be enough to reach the postseason in a traditionally loaded Western Conference, \"reported NBC .\" What's far more likely is that Bryant and <mark>Nash</mark> miss time at some point due to injury (whether major or minor), and that the roster simply doesn't have enough from a talent perspective to be able to compete on a nightly basis. A total of 35 wins and another trip to the Draft Lottery feels about right. \"The Lakers have high hopes after acquiring a number of new players, including Lin, Carlos Boozer, and Julius Randle, but will have trouble making it to the playoffs."}, {"articleID": "2019061315_00273145_W", "names": {"Theresa May": ["Q264766", "Q30161835"]}, "date": "2019-06-13", "url": "http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/national/17704953.uk-ready-to-assist-over-suspected-attacks-on-tankers-in-gulf-of-oman/", "content": "UK ready to assist over suspected attacks on tankers in Gulf of Oman By Press Association 2019 Iran Persian Gulf Tensions 0 comment The UK is prepared to assist in any rescue effort or investigation over the \"completely unacceptable\" suspected attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, Downing Street has said.

spanning the period of july 2010 through to this march - show the eight investigations cost $1,175,982 and have utilised 17,383 hours of investigators' time. the most expensive investigation was that into the failed finance company, bridgecorp limited, costing $356,666 and taking 6175 hours during the nine-month period. bridgecorp was placed in receivership in july 2007, owing 14,500 debenture holders about $459 million. former bridgecorp directors rodney petricevic and rob roest will make another court appearance on tuesday in relation to charges laid by the sfo. ad feedback the eight cases that the sfo has provided financial and logistical costs about are: bridgecorp limited, national finance 2000 limited, five star group, capital + merchant finance, kidicorp limited, lane walker rudkin, south canterbury finance and hanover finance. the investigation into kidicorp group ltd was terminated on wednesday. feeley said the probe - which totalled 909 hours and cost $50,496 - had determined \"there is no criminal offending here, or at least there is insufficient evidence of criminal offending\". the figures released by the sfo show the ongoing inquiry into the mark hotchin-headed hanover finance has, to date, cost $95,871. as of march 8, investigators had devoted a total of 1214 hours to the inquiry. the cost of the investigation is set to skyrocket, with feeley saying it was a long way from being completed. \"it is the case receiving the greatest level of resource within sfo. it is obviously a major case and there is a lot of public interest around it,\" feeley said. \"we are moving with some speed with hanover. but what people think of as speed in the context of fraud investigations, it is months not days .\" feeley said the sfo was now preparing for a full review of itself, saying there were things it could do better and also more cost-effectively. \"i would be the last person to say we couldn't do better. and certainly part of our review of processes is to try to look at cost-efficiency,\" feeley told the sunday star-times. \"i am sure we can do better. the sfo operates on an annual budget of $7.47 million. it employs 32 staff members and works on about 30 cases a year, with an average cost of $249,000. a key change feeley is contemplating is culling the number of charges they try to pin on people .\" do we look at 100 different offences in a major corporate collapse? or do we pick out two or three significant offences that fairly represent what has gone on there and concentrate on those? \"he said .\" historically, people said we should investigate every crime. but i guess from a cost-effectiveness point of view, if we end up convicting someone and they end up going to jail for seven years, does it matter whether you convict them of five offences or 500 offences...the outcome is effectively the same. \"he also wants to share more resources with the plethora of other government agencies potentially involved in charging commercial crooks. <mark>hughes</mark>, who has already had preliminary talks with feeley, told the sunday star-times:\" i am fully supportive of that. i don't think the new zealand taxpayer would be too impressed if we were seen to be duplicating assets and wasting public money. \"my desire is that we, wherever possible, streamline and work co-operatively .\" the fma will formally come into force once legislation is passed through parliament. it has made it through select committee phase and is now just awaiting official sign-off from parliament, with <mark>hughes</mark> saying it was his understanding \"we would expect to get sufficient house time to get through by mid-april\". that might be delayed slightly if more urgent legislation was required to be passed following the christchurch earthquake. high price of fraud convictions money allegedly ripped off kiwi investors: $3.5 billion money spent on eight high-profile investigations: $1.17 million convictions gained: three payback to mum and dad investors: nil -

CBH Chairman Wally Newman and Chief Executive Officer Andy Crane attended the ceremony together with directors and senior leaders including Interflour Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Greg Harvey, Intermalt General Manager James Kirton and representatives from the Vietnamese government. Mr Newman said CBH's involvement in downstream grain processing, through its 50 per cent shareholding of Interflour, had diversified the co-operative's income stream and resulted in increased market opportunities for Australian grain. \"CBH's investment in Interflour 12 years ago was ground breaking and today's opening of the Intermalt facility in Vietnam marks a new phase of growth for the business as it moves into barley processing and expands across South East Asia,\" said Newman. \"It will be a new chapter for Western Australian barley growers who now have direct access to Vietnam's burgeoning beer market--the fastest growing beer market in Asia .\" Mr Newman said over the past harvest growers delivered 1.5 million tonnes of malt barley into the CBH receival network and the facility provides a new market for growers. As part of the final commissioning phase, Intermalt has already purchased 42,000 tonnes of malt barley, with 32,000 tonnes coming from the Kwinana and Albany port zones of the Western Australian grain belt. Intermalt is located in Cai Mep, Vietnam, and will be the largest malting plant in South East Asia. It will have the capacity to produce 110,000 tonnes of malt a year and will service major brewers in the region including Heineken Vietnam. \"Not only is the Intermalt infrastructure impressive, but so too is the growth and opportunity it affords our growers, our businesses and the Asia Pacific region as a whole,\" Mr Newman said. \"Our current and future growers can look forward to benefiting from Interflour's expansion and this new venture generating value that we can then return to them a number of ways including through our investment rebate .\" Heineken Vietnam Corporate Affairs Director <mark>Matt Wilson</mark> said, \"Heineken Vietnam always seeks to use local suppliers where possible in order to drive jobs and wealth in Vietnam\". \"Our preference for local sourcing has seen us contribute around 0.75 per cent of Vietnam's total GDP and support nearly 200,000 jobs in Vietnam,\" he said. \"Because of this, we are very happy to see Intermalt entering the local market with the potential to supply us with locally produced malt in the future and increase our contribution to the Vietnamese economy .\" "}, {"articleID": "2018102720_00078791_W", "names": {"Jason Wilson": ["Q16225684", "Q26611719", "Q39074930", "Q6163780", "Q6163781", "Q6163783"]}, "date": "2018-10-27", "url": "http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/703643/The", "content": "Not long ago, we reported that new information on Medievil Remastered was set to be revealed soon.

to upper-70 degree range today through monday, according to the national weather service. \"it looks like we're in store for a very pleasant weekend weather-wise with the only chance for precipitation coming on saturday,\" said meteorologist <mark>karen clark</mark>. the good weather is good news for area boaters - at least those who can still afford to put their vessels in the water - as the boating season starts. the macomb county sheriff's marine patrol and u.s. coast guard are ready to monitor the waterways. \"this is the kickoff weekend for many boaters and with the nice weekend coming up, i'm sure there's going to be quite a few people out on lake st. clair,\" said macomb county sheriff mark hackel. thousands of local residents are expected to turn out for the six local memorial day parades and activities lined up to salute the sacrifice of military veterans who died or were injured while protecting the interests of the united states. the cousino high school marching band in warren will perform at the memorial day parade in washington, d.c., on the national mall. band director jeff cutter said 53 students and 10 adults will spend the weekend touring the sites in the u.s. capitol. \"everyone is excited to go,\" cutter said. \"it's a huge honor for us. we have quite a busy schedule of things to do, but the parade will be the last thing on the list on monday before we leave for home .\" in eastpointe, michigan lt. gov. <mark>john cherry</mark> will join congressman sander levin and local elected officials beginning at 11 a.m. monday along the parade route down gratiot to stephens and ending with a program at kennedy park, where newly elected 38th district court judge carl gerds will be the guest speaker. other parades are scheduled for new baltimore, romeo, roseville and sterling heights, all starting at 10 a.m. in st. clair shores -
