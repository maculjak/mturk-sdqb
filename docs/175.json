(fb) agreed to delete data collected from users within the european union for its facial - recognition feature by oct. 15, the irish privacy regulator said. the owner of the biggest social-networking site has faced several european reviews over concerns a facial-recognition program that automatically suggests people's names to tag in pictures breaches privacy rights. facebook ireland \"agreed to delete collected templates for eu users by oct. 15\" and to seek regulator consent \"if it chooses to provide the feature to eu users again,\" the irish office of the data protection commissioner said in the conclusions to a review today. data-protection regulators from the 27-nation eu have been looking into facebook's facial-recognition feature. norway's data-protection regulator said in august it was reviewing how the feature worked and what information facebook was storing. earlier this year, a group of regulators known as the eu's said people must consent to the use of their images. the irish audit \"is part of an ongoing process of oversight, and we are pleased that, as the data-protection commissioner said, the latest announcement is confirmation that we are not only compliant with european data-protection law, but we have gone beyond some of their initial recommendations,\" facebook said in an e-mailed statement. hamburg order the commissioner for data protection in hamburg, germany, today issued an \"administrative order\" that facebook can only create and store biometric profiles with the consent of users, including existing ones, for its facial recognition feature. the continued retention of user biometrics \"is now fully dealt with as facebook is agreeing to delete all such data\" by oct. 15, <mark>gary davis</mark>, ireland's deputy data-protection commissioner, said today. \"from that date, there will be no data processed in the eu in relation to this feature .\" data protection is currently policed by separate regulators across the eu. the bloc's executive body wants to simplify the system so companies deal with only one data-protection regulator in the region. the company's progress on \"a wide range of best-practice improvements\" was reviewed as part of on-site audits by the irish regulator in may and july. an agency report in december urged facebook to increase transparency and controls on using personal data for advertising and to delete user data sooner. the irish agency today said facebook had demonstrated \"a constructive approach\" in responding to its recommendations. reviewing compliance facebook ireland provides service to the palo alto, california-based company's users outside the u.s. and canada, according to the agency, which in 2011 began reviewing facebook's compliance with irish and eu data-protection rules. resumed a separate probe into the social network's facial-recognition features after suspending it two months earlier pending the irish audit. johannes caspar, the hamburg regulator, said in a phone interview today that facebook must comply with german law, regardless of any agreement with the irish regulator. he added that his office hadn't been told of the agreement with the irish agency and that if facebook's concessions to the irish are enough to fulfill the hamburg order, \"then all is fine .\" the irish data regulator's capabilities were put to the test last year when an austrian law student made 22 complaints about facebook's compliance with eu privacy rules, such as the company keeping photos on its servers after they'd been deleted. the irish agency conducted the investigation because facebook's european headquarters are located in dublin. the agency said today's report \"does not involve formal decisions by the office on the complaints it has received in relation to\" facebook ireland. \"the audit has taken account of the substantive issues raised in these complaints and it can be expected that at least some of these issues will have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the complainants .\" to contact the reporter on this story: stephanie bodoni in luxembourg at", "articleID": "2012092118_00004527_W", "names": {"Gary Davis": ["Q18022470", "Q3098532"]}}, {"date": "2012-09-21", "url": "http://ITBusinessNet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=2205403", "content": "<mark>yoko ono</mark> joins calls for pussy riot's prison release us-pussyriot-yokoono: <mark>yoko ono</mark> joins calls for pussy riot's prison release by christine kearney new york (reuters) - peace activist <mark>yoko ono</mark> on friday joined the prominent call to free the three imprisoned pussy riot punk band members, saluting their stand for freedom of speech after being handed a two-year sentence for staging a \"punk prayer\" in moscow's main cathedral. \"i thank pussy riot in standing firmly in their belief for freedom of expression and making all women of the world proud to be women,\" <mark>ono</mark> told reporters in new york, flanked by the husband and four year old daughter of one band member. she awarded the three imprisoned members - nadezhda tolokonnikova, maria alyokhina and yekaterina samutsevich - a peace grant established in the name of her late husband, former beatle <mark>john lennon</mark>. tolokonnikova's husband, pyotr verzilov, accepted <mark>ono</mark>'s grant on behalf of the three women. he said he and his daughter visited tolokonnikova in prison for the first time in six months earlier this week, where she is kept with her two fellow band members segregated from other prisoners. their daughter had sent her mother scribblings of plans of escape. \"for her it has been very emotional,\" he said, talking of his daughter's drawing, \"she breaks down the prison walls and helps nadia's escape .\" <mark>ono</mark> joined madonna, burmese opposition politician aung san suu kyi and rights groups that have also stood up against the band's imprisonment. speaking just days ahead of an october 1 appeal by the band, when amnesty international and other groups hope thousands of people will rally in dozens of cities, <mark>ono</mark> said she \"wanted to express my love and respect for them, i want to work for the immediate release from the prison they are in .\" the jail sentences - for the crime of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after the band stormed the altar of moscow's main cathedral calling on the virgin mary to rid russia of president vladimir putin - has drawn sharp international criticism. opposition groups say the case was part of a kremlin crackdown on dissent. putin has declined to comment on the ruling, but has suggested abuses committed against the russian orthodox church during the soviet era made pussy riot's protest particularly offensive. in response to the peace grant from <mark>ono</mark>, verzilov said his wife hoped the world was returning to the activism of her time in the 1960s and 1970s. \"nadia wants people to continue to actively keep fighting and supporting the cause and to learn it is important to stand up for values that are crucial to you, no matter the price, no matter the cost,\" he said. on thursday verzilov met with u.s. lawmakers and aides who have drafted legislation, known as the magnitsky bill, to impose u.s. sanctions against any russian officials involved in the prosecution of the band. he did not expect the october 1 appeal to cause significant change to the two year sentences. nor did he think russian prime minister <mark>dmitry medvedev</mark>'s comments last week that the band should be freed would carry much weight. hence he asked for international support. amnesty international have listed the three women on their prisoners of conscience list that aims to free those wrongly imprisoned for their political, religious and other beliefs. \"at it's core this case is about three young women who are in jail for the crime of singing a song,\" amnesty international usa executive director suzanne nossel told reporters. \"anybody can relate to this case and to these women and you cant help but feel your heart tugged .\" verzilov said that even now, from prison, the three women still do not regret the act--\"they are very strong women and nothing seems to break their spirit,\" he said.
