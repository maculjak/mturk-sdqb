The ruling Communist Party also said late Friday the country's much-criticized labor camp system would be abolished. The changes were part of a key policy document following a four-day meeting of party leaders through Tuesday. The party said families in which at least one parent was an only child would be allowed to have a second child themselves. Previously, both parents had to be an only child to qualify for this exemption. Rural couples are allowed two children if their first-born child is a girl, an exemption made in 1984 that was the last substantive change to the policy. Demographers argue that the population policy has created an aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. \"It's great, finally the Chinese government is officially acknowledging the demographic challenges it is facing,\" said <mark>Cai Yong</mark>, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. \"Although this is, relatively speaking, a small step, I think it's a positive step in the right direction and hope that this will be a transition to a more relaxed policy and eventual return of reproductive freedom to the Chinese people,\" <mark>Cai</mark> said. The Chinese government credits the one-child policy introduced in 1980 with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty. But the strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations by local officials, even though such measures are illegal. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Last year, a government think tank urged China's leaders to start phasing out the policy and allow two children for every family by 2015, saying the country had paid a \"huge political and social cost.\" The China Development Research Foundation said the policy had resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance because of illegal abortions of female fetuses and the infanticide of baby girls by parents who cling to a traditional preference for a son. The policy document does not specify when the family-size change takes effect, but details are expected when government offices roll out implementation plans later. The policy document released Friday maps out China's economic policy for coming decade, but also includes directives on improving the judicial system, helping farmers become city residents, maintaining controls on online expression and other issues. It also elaborates on the party's previous announcement that it would set up a national security commission. The party announced at the same time that it would abolish a labor camp system that allowed police to lock up government critics and other defendants for up to four years without trial. It confirmed a development that had been reportedly announced by the country's top law enforcement official earlier this year but was later retracted. Also known as \"re-education through labor,\" the system was established to punish early critics of the Communist Party but has been used by local officials to deal with people challenging their authority on issues including land rights and corruption. Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent Beijing lawyer who has represented several former labor camp detainees in seeking compensation, welcomed the abolition of the extra-legal system. \"There have been many methods used recently by this government that are against the rule of law, and do not respect human rights, or freedom of speech,\" Pu said. \"But by abolishing the labor camps...it makes it much harder for the police to put these people they clamp down on into labor camps.\" \"This is progress,\" Pu said. Earlier this year, state broadcaster CCTV said China has 310 labor camps holding about 310,000 prisoners and employing 100,000 staff."}, {"articleID": "2018021320_00367325_W", "names": {"Donald Trump": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "Christopher Peterson": ["Q4360278", "Q5113060"]}, "date": "2018-02-13", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/373657-consumer-protection-agency-drops-lawsuit-against-lender-that-charged-950", "content": "\u00a9 Getty The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped a lawsuit against a lender that was allegedly charging interest rates up to 950 percent, NPR reported.

ADVERTISEMENT The agency had sued Golden Valley in April, alleging unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices. Golden Valley declined NPR's request for comment. \"The <mark>Trump</mark> administration is just going to turn them loose and let them off the hook despite the fact they were making 950 percent interest rate loans to struggling families in ways that were illegal and unauthorized under both state and federal law,\" <mark>Peterson</mark> said. Mulvaney's spokesperson told NPR that the decision to drop the suit wasn't made by him, but by \"professional career staff.\" However, several bureau staffers pushed back against that claim, saying that Mulvaney was involved in the decision to stop pursuing the lawsuit. The spokesperson later said Mulvaney had in fact been involved. The dropped lawsuit comes as Mulvaney moves to reign in the agency.

This year's Grammy nominations may be as muddled as usual, but the Recording Academy sent at least one straightforward message with the picks it announced Friday night: Rock music didn't matter in 2013. No rock albums made the shortlist for the Grammys' flagship album of the year prize, nor is a rock act among the nominees for best new artist; the rock performance category, meanwhile, is padded with a cut from a live disc documenting Led Zeppelin's one-off reunion gig. Grammys: Alternative R & B largely overlooked in nominations Live review: Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande light up KIIS-FM Jingle Ball PHOTOS: KROQ-FM's Almost Acoustic Christmas 2013 Yet if the academy has decided that rock is dead, its verdict didn't hold much sway Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium, where L.A.'s KROQ-FM (106.7) presented the first night of its annual Almost Acoustic Christmas extravaganza. Here a very rowdy capacity crowd had gathered to watch nine bands - including Kings of Leon, Vampire Weekend and Queens of the Stone Age - bash through five hours of songs filled with fuzzy guitars set to galloping beats. (Phoenix and Lorde are among the acts scheduled to perform Sunday night .) \"You know that I could use somebody,\" sang Caleb Followill of Kings of Leon, and at the Shrine he had no shortage of enthusiastic somebodys to reassure him of his value. Alas, the crowd was too kind. Though they sounded OK in their big hits \"Use Somebody\" and \"Sex on Fire,\" both more or less foolproof, Kings of Leon were appallingly dull in Saturday's headlining slot, a boring (and bored-looking) outfit with none of the live-wire intensity that Followill and his mates used to project. AFI was more energetic but equally uninspiring in its performance, which pulled from the long-running California quartet's recently released \"Burials.\" A decade ago, AFI was honing a sometimes-thrilling mixture of punk thrash and goth romance, but at Acoustic Christmas it merely barreled through its set, the band's old dynamism reduced to an insistent whine, even in its vintage hit \"Miss Murder.\" More encouraging sounds - and reason, perhaps, to believe that rock can still make an impact - came from Vampire Weekend, the deeply clever New York City band whose latest album, \"Modern Vampires of the City,\" is one of the year's most acclaimed. (It's up for the alternative music Grammy .) On Saturday, Drake's song \"Worst Behavior\" blasted from the Shrine's speakers as the band arrived onstage, and that was just one sign that Vampire Weekend was looking beyond rock's usual borders; its set pulled from rap, reggae and African pop as Ezra Koenig floated his boyish vocals over arrangements that mixed strummy acoustic guitar with percolating machine beats. Fifties-rebel cool in a denim jacket with the collar turned up, Koenig in \"Diane Young\" led his bandmates through a synthed-up revamp of early rock? la Buddy Holly - \"<mark>Peggy Sue</mark>\" for the Age of Spotify. <mark>Alex Turner</mark> of England's Arctic Monkeys had a similar look, with a greaser's pompadour and hip-hugging jeans. And his band's set likewise juiced old forms, pairing Black Sabbath-style guitar licks with slowed-down grooves out of hip-hop and R & B; it was as sensual as it was menacing. Ditto Queens of the Stone Age, whose frontman Josh Homme has served lately as a kind of spirit guide for Arctic Monkeys. At the Shrine he sang merrily about drug use - \"nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol,\" as he put it specifically in \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" - while the rest of the group found inventive ways to give heavy metal a feeling of luxury. \"We're the drunkest band on the lineup,\" Homme said by way of introduction, and at this the audience roared its approval once again - in this case cheering an act with a clear sense of purpose.

(AP)--Randall Royer grew up in the Midwest, a suburban St. Louis kid. By the time he was 21, he had converted to Islam and changed his name to Ismail Royer, fighting in Bosnia alongside fellow Muslims against Serbian ethnic cleansing. By the time he was 31, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping friends who wanted to join the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks. Now age 44 and out of prison, he remembers Bosnia as both a highlight of his life and the place that launched him on a disastrous path. \"There was so much meaning and purpose in what I was doing,\" he said of the Bosnian war. \"I spent so much time trying to recapture that feeling of Bosnia. It never came back.\" He remembers with pride the gratitude expressed by the Bosnian families whose homes he defended and says the war is one of those rare conflicts where there was a clear good guy and bad guy. Royer's search for the next Bosnia led him to Pakistan, where he joined the fight over Kashmir--a conflict that he said he viewed with ambivalence. Eventually, he came back to the U.S. and served as a spokesman for some of the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights groups. Royer was one of about a dozen young Muslims from the D.C. area who played paintball in the northern Virginia woods as a means of preparing for holy war. After the Sept. 11 attacks, a few members of the group traveled to Pakistan, and with Royer's help, got in touch with the militant group Lashkar-e-Taibi. Royer's friends' ultimate goal was to join the Taliban and help fight U.S. soldiers. Royer pleaded guilty in 2004 to aiding and abetting use of a firearm in a crime of violence and aiding and abetting the carrying of an explosive. He was never convicted of a terrorism-related charge--a distinction that is significant to Royer. \"When I look back at myself, I don't see myself as an extremist,\" he said. \"I see myself as being naive, romantic, a Don Quixote kind of guy.\" He points out that he has a long history of speaking out against al-Qaida, and he is equally critical of the Islamic State, which is now responsible for motivating and recruiting most of the lone-wolf terrorists who have popped up in the U.S. <mark>Michael Jensen</mark>, a researcher with the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, said he also sees a difference between Royer and the more modern iteration of Islamic extremists. He said Royer was drawn to localized conflicts like Bosnia and Kashmir, as opposed to the global jihadist vision espoused by al-Qaida or the Islamic State. Royer said what drew him to Islam in the first place was his view that it could be a vehicle for social justice. In the Muslim world, though, he said a quest for social justice gets twisted into a sense of victimization and even a persecution complex. \"If you're constantly blaming other people, you'll never change,\" he said. Tariq Nelson, a friend of Royer for more than 20 years, said Royer's desire to right wrongs on a global scale ultimately led him down the wrong path. \"He was an idealist who got caught--they all got in over their heads,\" Nelson said. \"To an outsider it sounds strange. Nobody wanted to be a terrorist. In fact they were anti-terrorist.\" More from this section Don't ask where Paula Vogel is. Ask where isn't she? 8:18 President Trump Participates in the White House Easter Egg Roll Man shot by law enforcement in West Virginia identified When the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, Royer said his Muslim identity led him to struggle with the question of whether being an American and Muslim were compatible. An Islamic scholar from northern Virginia, Ali Al-Timimi, advised the paintball group in the days after Sept. 11 that an apocalyptic clash of Muslim and Western civilizations was approaching, and that Muslim men should \"go be with the mujahedeen.\" It helped prompt Royer to return to Bosnia, and it prompted others in the group to seek Royer's help in joining Lashkar. In hindsight, Royer said, it was \"colossally bad advice.\" Al-Timimi was convicted of soliciting treason and sentenced to life in prison. While Royer was behind bars, he continued to do what he had always done. He debated philosophy and theology, and often found himself as the advocate for moderation and tolerance. He said he carried on debates with some of the most notorious criminals, including al-Qaida \"shoe bomber\" <mark>Richard Reid</mark>, passing notes from cell to cell because prisoners in his unit were kept in isolation.

Thor Odinson is an Asgardian warrior-prince, the God of Thunder and a self-proclaimed protector of Earth. Thor subsequently became well known for his actions on Earth, which included acting as a founding member of the Avengers. He is also based on his original comic book incineration. He is the Kid-Appeal Character of the \"Marvel's The Avegners\" Team. Thor is one of the main protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing as the titular main protagonist of the Thor trilogy as well as being one of the titular main protagonists in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers, and it's sequels the 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2018 Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. He is the only Avenger that is non-human and one of the few superheroes in the MCU with genuine super powers (the others being the Hulk and Captain America). Thor wields the mystical war hammer Mjolnir, which controls the weather, but he himself also has godlike limitless strength, incalcuable durability and unimaginable agility until his hammer being destroyed by his evil sister Hela, now Thor have a more powerful weapon named Stormbreaker who can even injure the most powerful lord Thanos and the Stormbreaker permect to to the teletrasporta himself or someone else in another place and will back to him if he will launch it. He is based on the mythological thunder-god of the same name from Norse mythology. He is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Contents [show] Role in Marvel Cinematic Universe Early life Thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in Asgard as the treasured son of Odin and his wife Frigga. His best friend and playmate was his adopted brother Loki, and though they were rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions. Loki was taught magic by their mother, while Thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father. Brought up in the warrior culture of the Asgardians, Thor valued strength, courage, and loyalty above all else. He desired to be exactly like his father, the war hero, and received the powerful hammer, Mj\u00f8lnir. Thor often remarked on the monsters he would slay and the wars he would win once he was king. Thor (2011) Thor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his band of warriors, which included Loki, the Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three on adventures. However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle. Thor also defeated Imir, a rogue Asgardian who threatened to take control of Asgard and kidnapped several Dwarves. While Imir managed to get the upper hand on Thor, he was eventually defeated when Thor electrocuted him with Mj\u00f8lnir. Odin decided to make Thor king and ruler of Asgard as he was about to finally enter the Odin sleep after putting it off for so long. Thor reveled in the ceremony and underwent the passage of becoming king from Odin. As Odin was about to name Thor King, he sensed that Frost Giants had sneaked into Asgard and into his vault to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters. Odin, Thor, and Loki went to the vault to find the Frost Giants had already been slayed by The Destroyer. Seeing how close they had come to stealing the artifacts, Thor declared that they must go to Jotunheim and show their strength to ensure the Giants would never trespass in Asgard again. Odin replied that the trespassers were only a few, not an invading force and that they paid for their crime with their lives, but Thor insisted that as King of Asgard he would lead an army to Jotunheim as Odin had done before him. Odin reminded him that he was not King yet and ordered him not to attack. In their quarters, Thor began throwing tables around in anger. Loki convinced him that he was right and they must go to Jotunheim to confront King Laufey. As they were talking Lady Sif and the Warriors Three arrived. Thor announced they were going to Jotunheim and that he would lead them to victory, although they were initially skeptical over the risks, Thor reminded them of their past victories and soon changed their minds. They traveled to the Bifrost Bridge and sought Heimdall's permission for passage to Jotunheim. Heimdall granted it and sent them to Jotunheim, but warned that if they got into trouble they would not be granted entrance back. In Jotunheim, Thor led the warriors to King Laufey's chamber where the giant warned them to leave while he still allowed them. One of the Frost Giants approached Thor before Loki led him away. Thor remained silent until the Frost Giant called Thor a princess. Thor unleashed his anger and the mighty power of Mj\u00f8lnir and the warriors bravely battled the Frost Giants. Fandral was struck by a Frost Giant and warned Thor to pull back. Thor told them to leave while he battled the Frost Giants alone. As his friends left and reached the Bifrost Bridge, Thor unleashed the full power of Mj\u00f8lnir and erupted the ground around him killing hundreds of Frost Giants, before flying at full speed to kill Laufey's beast that was chasing the Asgardians. Laufey and his whole army then surrounded Thor and his friends, who were driven back to the edge of a cliff. Before they attacked, Odin arrived and warned Laufey by telling him to preserve the peace and not respond to the actions of a boy. Laufey said that war had already begun, and Odin transported himself and the other Asgardians back to Asgard. Back in the Bifrost, Thor told the Warriors Three to take Fandral to the Healing Room. Odin then chastised Thor for his reckless actions saying that he would sacrifice the lives of innocent people to go to war and that they were not the actions of a King, but a warrior. Thor told Odin he was an old man and a fool. Odin then took Mj\u00f8lnir from Thor and removed his powers before using the Bifrost to banish Thor to Earth. Thor was sent through the Bifrost Bridge arriving to Earth in a wormhole, which was being studied by Dr. Jane <mark>Foster</mark>, Dr. Erik Selvig and their understudy Darcy Lewis. Thor stood only to be knocked over by the truck they were driving. He awoke, eventually realizing he was on Earth, and began shouting to Heimdall to open the Bifrost. The humans believed Thor to be crazy and when Lewis threatened Thor with a Taser, he was disgusted at her actions and she tasered him. He awoke in a hospital with a man over him saying he that was about to take some blood. Unaware of his surroundings, Thor attacked the hospital staff and security guards taking on dozens before being sedated. He awoke again to find himself strapped down but managed to squeeze out of the restraints and headed for the exit before being hit again by a car, again driven by <mark>Foster</mark>. They took him back to their Wormhole Research Center where <mark>Foster</mark> gave him some clothes. Thor said that he was hungry and they took him to Isabel's Diner. He ate enormous amounts of food astonishing the three before smashing his cup on the floor demanding another drink. <mark>Foster</mark> told him that if he wanted another he should ask nicely; Thor then overheard Pete and Jake talking about a \"satellite\" that had crashed to Earth. Thor realized it was Mj\u00f8lnir and asked for directions. He said goodbye to <mark>Foster</mark>, Lewis, and Selvig and began to walk to Mj\u00f8lnir. Realizing as a mortal it was too far, he went to the local pet store demanding a horse. The owner said that they did not have horses only cats, dogs, and other house animals to which Thor asked for one large enough to ride; instead all he received was a very confused look from the shop worker. He left unsatisfied only to see <mark>Foster</mark> again who offered him a ride. <mark>Foster</mark> told Thor that S.H.I.E.L.D. had stolen all of her research. Thor promised to tell her everything she wanted to know about the wormholes when he reclaimed what was his. They arrived at the site to find it covered by a makeshift research facility. Thor entered and took down Agents Jackson and Delancey before being noticed and began making his way to Mj\u00f8lnir. Thor began taking down guard after guard, before coming across a particularly big guard whom Thor ultimately defeated outside. Thor was unaware that the entire time Clint Barton was taking aim and preparing to shoot him with an arrow. Finally at Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor rejoiced before gripping his mighty hammer but could not lift it; using all of his mortal strength, he still could not lift it. Knowing his father had taken his powers away from him, he screamed at the heavens and fell to his knees. As the guards arrested him he noticed a small Asgardian symbol appear on Mj\u00f8lnir, and became heartbroken that he may never see his home again. He was taken for questioning by Agent Phil Coulson but did not respond to any questions, Coulson was convinced he must be special forces due to his remarkable fighting skills. When Coulson left for a moment Loki then arrived in front of him to tell him that Odin was dead and that in Thor's absence Loki had been made ruler of Asgard. When Thor asked if he could go home Loki explained that Thor must remain on Earth to maintain peace with Jotunheim, Thor agreed to the arrangement and said goodbye to his brother. Agent Coulson then returned to find Thor saying goodbye to thin air. Dr. Selvig then approached telling S.H.I.E.L.D. that Thor was Dr. Donald Blake, their colleague who was drunk and very upset about the loss of their equipment, and Agent Coulson let him go so that he could follow them. Thor and Selvig went for a drink where Selvig asked Thor to leave in the morning. He agreed and they share another drink. After a few more drinks Thor's drinking prowess led to them getting into a bar brawl and Thor took a heavily drunk Selvig back to Jane's camper. Thor and <mark>Foster</mark> went to the roof of the Research Center and gazed at the stars. She told Thor about herself and Thor began to tell her about the Nine Realms and Yggdrasil, the World Tree; he explained that her theories were correct and tried to help her understand them better. He also returned her notebook which he had retaken from S.H.I.E.L.D.. When she fell asleep Thor ensured that she was warm before watching over her as she slept. The next day Thor's attitude had taken a change for the better and he made breakfast with Jane <mark>Foster</mark> when they were interrupted by the Warriors Three and Sif who had found Thor. Thor rejoiced to see them before they informed him that Odin was alive and that Loki was king and had showed the Frost Giants the way into Asgard until they saw another Wormhole in the distance and realized that Loki had sent forces after them. Thor, <mark>Foster</mark>, Erik Selvig and Darcy Lewis began to evacuate the town as the Warriors Three and Sif formulated a plan to stop the Destroyer. The Destroyer began attacking the town, destroying everything in its path and knocked back the Warriors Three before being seemingly stopped by Sif's Sword. The Destroyer simply rearranged its body to face Sif and nearly killed her. With this the Destroyer seemed unstoppable. Thor told them to fall back and that he had a plan. Thor approached the Destroyer and spoke to Loki through it, telling him that he was sorry but that he could not allow him to kill the innocent people and instead to take his life. Loki seemingly relented before using the Destroyer to send Thor flying backwards. Thor was dying and Jane came to his aid and sat with him before he seemingly passed. The Destroyer continued to destroy the town before Mj\u00f8lnir flew to Thor and returned his powers. Thor then created a tornado around the Destroyer and engaged it, deflecting its beams before directing its energy against itself, destroying it. Thor then told Agent Phil Coulson who had arrived that he must return <mark>Foster</mark>'s research if he wanted his help in the future as they fought on the same side and for the same goal. Thor then promised to show <mark>Foster</mark> the Bifrost Bridge and flew her to the Bifrost site. When Thor asked for the Bifrost to open, Heimdall did not respond. The Warriors Three and Sif arrived and he still did not reply. Heimdall eventually answered and the Asgardians returned. Thor then flew to Odin's Chamber to see his mother Frigga and Loki who was shocked to see him. Thor revealed Loki's deception. Loki said he did it all to impress their father and to be Thor's equal; he promised to destroy Jotunheim using the Bifrost Bridge and attacked Thor, who refused to fight his brother. Loki sent Thor flying through the wall of the chamber and headed to the Bifrost where he began the process of destroying Jotunheim. Thor flew to the Bifrost and engaged Loki. After a heartbreaking argument, Loki and Thor erupted into an intense battle where they both appeared evenly matched, but Thor eventually managed to tie Loki down by placing Mj\u00f8lnir on top of him and went to stop the Bifrost but it was too far gone to stop now. Thor did not want to destroy the Bifrost because then he could not return to Earth to see Jane <mark>Foster</mark> but for the sake of the Nine Realms, called Mj\u00f8lnir to him and began destroying the Rainbow Bridge and the Bifrost fell away from Asgard in an almighty explosion and into the abyss of space. Thor and Loki were caught by Odin who had awakened from the Odin sleep and Loki revealed he did it all for him before letting go and falling into the abyss. As the Asgardians celebrated, Thor went to see his father, telling him that he was wrong for his prior actions and that he had a lot to learn from him. Odin in return told Thor that he would be a wise king. Thor then went to see Heimdall asking if there was any hope of returning to Earth. Heimdall told him there was always hope. Thor asked what Jane <mark>Foster</mark> was doing and Heimdall replied she was looking for Thor. A few days after Thor defeated Loki, Heimdall had discovered that destroying the Bifrost Bridge had put all of the Nine Realms in danger. He informed Odin and Thor of this. Thor feared for his friend Hogun's people in Vanaheim and warned him. A year later, Frigga managed to contact Loki in Chitauri Space. She informed Thor, Odin, and the Warriors Three of this and that he was planning an attack on Earth involving the Tesseract. Odin called upon the power of dark energy - the very fabric of the universe itself - to send Thor to Earth to stop him, at the cost of his own and Thor's health. An unconscious Thor landed on a mountain, not far from Loki's location, and began searching for his brother as soon as he regained consciousness. The Avengers (2012) When Capt. America and Iron Man succeded to capture Loki, who is on & off mind controlled by an unknown warlord, after he attacked people in Germany, Thor landed on the Quinjet in which Loki was being escorted back to the Helicarrier by Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Widow, and he took Loki from their custody. Thor tried to convince Loki to give up his plans and return home to Asgard with the Tesseract, though Loki still resented Thor. It was during their conversation that Thor learned that Loki was working for another party, although he never learned who it was. When Loki continued to mock him and refused to answer his questions, Thor picked up Mj\u00f8lnir and threatened him. Iron Man suddenly attacked him and the two traded blows when Iron Man refused to allow Thor to take their prisoner. When Captain America intervened, he pointed out that they should not be fighting with each other, and asked Thor to put Mj\u00f8lnir down. In response, Thor brought his hammer down on Captain America, who blocked it with his shield which absorbed the impact, shocking Thor, who realized - upon seeing the destruction he had helped to cause - that they had the same goal and so stopped fighting. They returned to the Helicarrier, where Loki was put into a cell designed to hold and dispose of Hulk if necessary. Thor was quick to point out that while Loki was unstable, he was his brother, though when it is brought up that Loki had killed several people, Thor quickly reasserted that Loki was adopted. Later he asked Agent Phil Coulson about Jane <mark>Foster</mark> and was told that she was moved to a secure location when Loki returned and Erik Selvig was put under his control. Nick Fury asked what Thor was prepared to do in order to keep Loki's plans from reaching fruition, though he was unsure. Later as Thor and the others argued, Hawkeye, under Loki's mind control, blew up one of the Helicarrier's engines and helped free Loki, also triggering Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor found the Hulk moments before he would have killed Black Widow; Thor fought the Hulk, being the only one who could match him for strength. It is well known that Thor holds back an overwhelming majority of the abilities he possesses which are intrinsic to his physical being, sans Mjolnir. Else the Hulk would have been obliterated. Thor's reluctance to fight at optimal capacity allowed the Hulk to gain the upper hand against Thor until a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet shot at Hulk and caused him to leap from the heli-carrier. Thor went to make sure that Loki was still contained. When he arrived the cell door was open and Loki was leaving, Thor tried to stop Loki from leaving but it turned out to be an illusion and Thor became trapped in the cell. Thor tried to break the glass but this caused the cell to almost fall from the sky. Loki threatened to drop the cage when Coulson confronted him with a gun made from the Destroyer. Loki used another illusion to get behind Coulson stabbed him through the heart. Thor looked on helplessly as Loki and dropped Thor out of the Helicarrier. As he plummeted towards Earth, Thor was thrown from side to side and was unable to hit the glass, but he managed to smash free from the cell just in time to avoid the impact. He landed heavily in an empty field, dropping Mj\u00f8lnir on his landing. Thor then retrieved Mjolnir then departed to rendezvous with the other Avengers. Arriving at Stark Tower once Loki had used the Tesseract to open a portal allowing the Chitauri and Leviathan to invade Earth, Thor again tried to convince him to stop, since the Chitauri were destroying the world he wanted to rule. Failing, he briefly clashed with his brother before Loki fled on a Chitauri Chariot. Thor joined Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye on the battlefield, and started helping to fight the Chitauri, before Iron Man and Hulk joined them. Captain America, the greatest field leader in the battle, charged Thor with using his mastery of lightning to stem the flow of enemies coming through the portal. Thor flew to the top of the Chrysler Building where he used his lightning bolts to destroy the oncoming army. If he were able to remain there and continue his assault on the enemy the battle would have been over in minutes. However, due to the other Avenger's inability to halt the enemy that had already arrived he was forced to abandon his post to assist his teammates. While flying around in New York City, Iron Man asked Thor if he had ever seen Game of Thrones, saying he reminded him of it. Thor then asked Iron Man how he could make jokes in the middle of a war. He was then eaten by a Leviathan. In a blind rage, Thor used Mj\u00f8lnir to get out of the Leviathan. He later helped Hulk bring down a Leviathan; they fought the Chitauri army on top of the beast until together they killed the beast. Though when they were done Hulk punched him for earlier. This blind sided attack had no effect on Thor as he was able to return to the battle without a single mark to show from the a punch by a so-called massivley strong being. Soon Iron Man sent a nuclear missile intended for the city through the portal, which destroyed the Chitauri Command Center, cutting off the forces from their power source and killing them, while Black Widow closed the portal. Once the crisis was over, Thor joined the other Avengers in confronting Loki, who had already been heavily wounded and battered by the Hulk who accidentally free the God of Meschief from the mind control of the mysterious warlord, and took him into custody, however despite Loki is back in himself he will remains crazy for some time before he will have his mental sanity back due to the shocking mind control and so Loki temporarily remains with the warlord's ideas about the humans and for this he's taken in custody. Then, Thor and the other Avengers went to the Shawarma Palace and ate silently. They were interrupted by War Machine, who arrived too late to help fight in the battle. After claiming the Tesseract, Thor took Loki with him back to Asgard by opening a portal with the Tesseract and left the other Avengers in Central Park. After bringing Loki back to Asgard, Thor discovered that Vanaheim was getting slowly taken over by Marauders. Thor gave Heimdall the Tesseract so he that could remake the Bifrost Bridge and the Asgardians could help protect the Nine Realms again. He then, with an army of Asgardians, went to end the threats controlling the Nine Realms. Thor: The Dark World Sometime after the Battle of New York, a group of rag-tag invaders known as the Marauders started a war across all the Nine Realms. Thor, now a full-time general of the Asgardian army, bravely led his forces in a fight against the attackers. With Sif, Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, they teamed up to and fought the invading army. During a battle in Vanaheim, Hogan's homeworld, Thor and Sif fought side by side until a giant rock monster called Korg appeared. The Marauders celebrated as they believed Thor would be unable to defeat the monster. Sif allowed Thor to fight it alone and Thor calmly joked that he accepted it's surrender. When the monster appeared to still want to fight Thor killed it with a single powerful blow from his hammer, which caused all the other invaders to surrender. That was the final battle in a two-year war. After the battle was won the surviving invanders were taken to a Asgardian prison. Thor spoke to Hogun, telling him to stay there with his people, as the rest of them went back to Asgard, which Hogun was very grateful for. Thor then left Vanaheim via the Bifrost Bridge, which was repaired with the power of the Tesseract. A party was held for Thor for restoring the peace in the Nine Realms. Volstagg and Fandral remained in high spirits, drinking and telling war stories with beautiful women, but Thor left quickly. He was stopped by Lady Sif who asked him if he would have a drink with her; he kindly refused and thanked her for her company. He walked to the end of the Bifrost, wanted to ask Heimdall how Jane <mark>Foster</mark> was doing. The next day Odin told Thor that he should not hold on to <mark>Foster</mark> too much since she would die long before Thor. With Thor returning to see Jane <mark>Foster</mark>, <mark>Foster</mark> noticed a circle of rain around her; then Thor beamed down. <mark>Foster</mark> slapped him in the face to check if he was real, and then one more time for taking two years to visit her even though he was on Earth during the battle of New York. When one of the officers at the scene attempted to arrest her for trespassing, he was blown back by the Aether; Thor grabbed <mark>Foster</mark> to return to Asgard with her. Eir analyzed <mark>Foster</mark>'s condition upon Thor's request, but Odin arrived to tell him to take <mark>Foster</mark> back to Earth despite his protests. However, when the guards attempted to remove her and were once again blown back by the Aether. Seeing the potential danger, Odin explained to them that the Aether was created by the leader of the Dark Elves, Malekith. He allowed <mark>Foster</mark> to stay until it could be safely removed from her. Thor and <mark>Foster</mark> spent time together in Asgard and Thor explained to her the story behind the Convergence which had caused her to come in contact with the Aether. They shared a kiss and were interrupted by Thor's mother Frigga. Thor made introductions but was distracted by an alarm at the dungeons. When Malekith invaded Asgard, Thor flew into battle and ordered the prisoners to return to their cells, when they refused Thor battled them alongside Volstagg, Fandral and the remaining prison guards. After helping to quell the riot, Thor felt the entire palace shake as Malekith's ship crash landed into the Great Hall. He ran to the aid of his people and arrived just in time to witness his mother, Frigga, fall down bleeding on the ground from being stabbed by Algrim. In anger, Thor burned half of Malekith's face with a lightning bolt and threw his hammer, Mj\u00f8lnir, into Algrim and Malekith, sending them back to their ship and repelling the invasion. A funeral was later held for the dead Asgardians and Frigga. Thor attended and watched his mother transform into stars in the universe. Thor knew that Malekith would return for Jane <mark>Foster</mark>, and he learned that Odin had locked Jane away in Asgard. Thor desperately tried to convince Odin that Malekith would return and destroy Asgard, he explained his plan to trick Malekith and destroy the Aether, but, blinded by hate and grief, Odin would not let Thor move her. Odin told Thor that he planned to fight a new war with the Dark Elves until they were wiped from existence. However during their argument it became clear that Odin was becoming weaker and uneasy on his feet. Thor knew that they would not win a war with the Dark Elves. Thor then devised a plan to move her even if he would then commit treason and in the worst case get them killed. He asked Heimdall if he could keep quiet. Since Loki managed to get three Frost Giants into Asgard, Thor hoped that he could take them to Svartalfheim. Thor traveled to the dungeons and spoke to Loki. He knew that Loki was maintaining an illusion and forced him to reveal the truth, that Loki had trashed his cell in grief when he learnt of Frigga's death. Thor promised Loki that he he agreed to help then he would free him from his prison cell and grant him revenge for their mother's death. Loki agreed. . Thor and Loki made their escape through the halls of Asgard, to remain unnoticed Loki disguised himself as a guard. However, when it became clear he was annoying Thor with his constant talking, Loki decided to have more fun and changed Thor's appearance into Lady Sif and his own into Captain America, mocking Thor as he went. Thor pinned Loki against a wall when he spotted some guards, Loki requested his dagger but Thor instead gave him a new pair of handcuffs. <mark>Foster</mark> and Loki then boarded the Dark Elf Harrow. While Sif and Volstagg delayed the guards, Thor flew out beside the Bifrost Bridge, pushed out Loki and jumped out himself with a sick <mark>Foster</mark> in his arms. They all landed on a smaller Asgardian Skiff that Fandral had been driving. They were hunted by an Asgardian patrol but Fandral went over to their ship and knocked out the soldiers. Loki then drove through the secret passageway that took them to Svartalfheim. The trio successfully landed in the wastelands of Svartalfheim and Jane <mark>Foster</mark> regained her strength. Loki began to mock Thor about his love for a mortal woman; this lead to an intense argument between the two leading to Thor nearly punching his brother. He stepped back when he thought how Frigga would not want them to fight. Loki however said she would not be surprised. They shared a laugh and started to talk about wanting to trust Loki; Loki told him to trust his rage. They made their way through Svartalfheim and saw Malekith leaving his ship. Loki once again asked Thor if he trusted him, when Thor asked if he would trust himself, Loki said he could not and used his dagger to stab Thor in the side and throw him off a cliff. He kicked and beat Thor before cutting his hand off. Malekithhad been there waiting for them; Loki told him that all he wanted in return for <mark>Foster</mark> was a good spot where he could see Asgard burn. Algrim remembered seeing Loki in a prison cell, so he told Malekith that Loki was an enemy of Asgard. Malekith then began to draw the Aether out of <mark>Foster</mark> but while he was still absorbing it, Thor shouted Loki's name. Loki had only created an illusion of cutting off Thor's arm and Thor called for Mj\u00f8lnir. He then shot a lightning bolt on the Aether, causing it to explode. Loki jumped on top of <mark>Foster</mark> to prevent the Aether explosion from hitting her. Malekith had already absorbed enough power and he left, telling Algrim to take care of the rest. Algrim threw a Black Hole Grenade in the air; Loki almost got sucked in but Thor managed to save him. Algrim started to beat up Thor but Loki then stabbed him in the back with a sword. Algrim, being \"the last of the Kursed\" , was not injured and he grabbed Loki and pushed him towards his chest. The blade sticking out of Algrim's chest then pierces Loki's solar plexus. Loki managed to press one of Algrim's implosion bombs and Algrim was killed in the ensuing explosion. Loki then seemingly died in Thor's arms much to Thor's grief, unaware that in spite the fact that Loki agreed to cooperate with him, Loki has schemed to kill two birds with one stone: Go with his brother to gained the opportunity to avenge Frigga's death and then took over Odin's place after Thor left him. Thor and Jane <mark>Foster</mark> then entered a cave that seemed to have all the objects that did not come back when Ian Boothby, Darcy Lewis and the kids played at the storage house. <mark>Foster</mark> grabbed Boothby's car keys and, as she and Thor continued into the cave, they were transported back to the storage house in London. When they got to Earth the worlds were almost in line and Malekith had landed. Thor and Malekith met each other on the battleground and exchanged threats before Malekith attempted to kill Thor with the Aether's power. Thor was able to use Mj\u00f8lnir to deflect the attacks and mocked Malekith's lack of strength and knocking him back with a hit from Mj\u00f8lnir. The Asgardian and the Dark Elf began to fight and the Battle took them through many different worlds, although their equally matched strength meant neither could kill the other. The Dark Elves began to invade Greenwich but Erik Selvig's devices teleported some of them away. Thor and Malekith crash landed in Svartalfheim where Thor lost Mj\u00f8lnir through a portal, leaving him near defenceless from Malekith's attacks. When they landed on Jotunheim they were nearly killed by a Jotunheim Beast before they were teleported to separate parts of London, with Thor being forced to use the subway to make his way back to Greenwich. Malekith, now back on Earth and next to his ship, started to release the Aether. Thor found <mark>Foster</mark> and Selvig. They told him that neither of them could get close to Malekith, but Thor could. Thor took Selvig's devices and threw them onto Malekith's arms, teleporting them to Svartalfheim. Then he threw the last one in Malekith's chest, teleporting him to Svartalfheim. But now Malekith's ship had started to fall down on to their heads. Luckily, Selvig's devices teleported the ship away and it crashed down on Malekith, killing him. After the battle, Thor returned to Asgard and talked with Odin (who was actually Loki using a magical disguise). He spoke about Loki's sacrifice and how he believed his brother had died a hero. He then explained his desire to return to earth and be with Jane <mark>Foster</mark>, and renounced his claim to the throne. He offered Odin Mj\u00f8lnir which he refused (as Loki would have been unable to lift it). He then returned to Earth and was reunited with <mark>Foster</mark>. Soon after, when S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson and his team were investigating the discovery of a lost Asgardian artifact known as the Berserker Staff, he sought to consult with Thor, but was informed by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury that Thor had taken himself \"off the grid\" . Phil Coulson told Sif, when she came to Earth chasing Lorelei, that it would be better if he told Thor himself that he was alive. Avengers: Age of Ultron Thor and the Avengers located Loki's Scepter at a secret HYDRA base in Sokovia. While searching for the Scepter, Thor noted that HYDRA would not have been able to build such powerful technology without it. During the battle the group was attacked by Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, twin siblings that had volunteered for HYDRA's experiments. Clint Barton was injured during this with Thor offering to get him back to the relative safety of the Quinjet. Eventually Tony Stark located the Scepter and HYDRA was finally defeated although the Maximoff twins did escape. On the Quinjet Natasha Romanoff asked Thor for an assessment of the Bruce Banner's skills on the battlefield Thor commented on the Hulk's violence. Seeing that this upset Banner Thor told him that many of the injuries he inflicted on the soldiers was non fatal. On the way back Tony asked Thor to allow him to analyze the scepter before Thor took it back to Asgard which he agreed to. Now living on earth, Thor attended a party at Avengers Tower challenging the other Avengers to lift Mj\u00f8lnir; only <mark>Steve Rogers</mark> was able to move it which made Thor nervous for a moment. When all the Avengers failed, Thor implied that it was simply because they were unworthy. While the Avengers in the Avengers Tower were celebrating and trying to lift Mj\u00f8lnir, Ultron emerged to greet the heroes as he described them all as killers. Ultron beckoned the Iron Legion to attack the heroes as he watched. As the battle ensued, one of the Iron Legion drones left with the Scepter in hand. When all the Iron Legion drones were destroyed, Ultron crushed the remains of one the drones while describing the initial confusion he had felt when he was \"born\" . Thor immediately destroyed Ultron's body (which actually a one-use Prototype Body). Ultron is then heard ominously singing a phrase from \"Pinocchio\" as his voice dies out. After taking safe haven at Clint Barton's Homestead Thor decides to leave, telling <mark>Steve</mark> that he must unlock the secrets of his hallucinations. Thor finds Erik Selvig to help find the \"Water of Sights\" . Thor enters the pool and the water sprites allow him to revisit his nightmare. He sees visions of the destruction of Asgard, the Infinity Stones and the birth of Vision. During a discussion between the Avengers, Thor appeared and cast a bolt of lightning at the machine. The body inside it broke, revealing a humanoid being with reddish pink and green skin. Confused about his surroundings as he glanced around, the being's gaze immediately focused on Thor as he recognized Thor to be an infinitely powerful being not of this Earth and the only real threat to him. He then jumped on the God of Thunder. Thor was able to counter by tossing him out a glass window, but the being was able to stop himself instantly. The being then took the time to examine himself on the reflection of the glass window while also gazing out into the city. The being apologized for its actions and then offered its gratitude to Thor before taking a similar appearance to the God of Thunder's outfit, mainly the cape and gauntlets. Thor explained that he witnessed a vision where the Earth will be destroyed and at the center of it is the gem that is implanted on the being's forehead which he reveals is the Mind Stone, a object that is a member of the Infinity Stones, describing them as the greatest power in the universe. Captain America, confused as to why this \"vision\" sounded like J.A.R.V.I.S., allowed Tony to explain that he reconfigured his matrix to create \"something new\" . The Vision stated that he is not a child of Ultron, Ultron himself or J.A.R.V.I.S., he is only himself. The Avengers, along with the Maximoff twins, remained skeptical as to which side the Vision was on, to which the android explained that he was on the side of life while Ultron was not, and then went on to say that Ultron was waiting for the Avengers, especially Tony Stark, in Sokovia. He then stated that Ultron was in pain, and that he would spread his rage and pain all across the globe. After finishing, he casually lifted Mj\u00f8lnir and offered it back to Thor, much to the bewilderment and surprise from everyone in the room, before leaving Thor a claims Tony. The first evacuation began with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch escorting the civilians out of the city. Quicksilver being more aggressive due to them not cooperating at first, then Scarlet Witch using her hypnosis on the people and controlling them to leave their homes. Later, Bruce Banner along with Hawkeye were searching for Black Widow whom was held captive by Ultron. Bruce Banner found her first and destroyed the lock with a laser gun, freeing her. Later, Iron Man flew over to the church where Ultron was in his new armor. Ultron then confronted his creator and pointed out that he was stalling to protect the people of Sokovia. Tony replied that this was the mission that Ultron was supposed to complete, however, Ultron countered by saying that he has moved beyond his mission and that he is free. Suddenly, the activation device juts out from the ground as Ultron revealed that he too has been stalling until it reached the surface. Just then, the Ultron Sentries also emerged from the ground and the water and began to attack the civilians. This prompted Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers to retaliate by attacking the Sentries. Scarlet Witch attempted to aid her people by moving them off a bridge while Hawkeye bought her time by destroying the drones with his arrows. One of the drones landed down and fired at the people, only for Wanda to create a shield and repelling the blasts. However, the shield dissipated from the force of the blasts knocking Scarlet Witch to the ground. Back at the church, Vision confronted Ultron as the two gazed at one another while taking flight. The Vision pleaded to Ultron that he can change all of this since he is the one who set the terms. Ultron responded by choking the Vision, however, this gave the android the opportunity to hack into Ultron's mainframe and prevent him from escaping through the net. Captain America was battling the sentries on the bridge while Thor fought the bots underground as he made his way towards the machine. Quicksilver soon joined the fray, using his super speed to take out many drones in the blink of an eye. Vision succeeded in burning Ultron out of the net, but this incapacitated Vision and only stunned Ultron briefly. He smashed Vision to the ground before activating the machine. Thor reached the boosters of the machine, only to find himself too late as it was activated. A massive portion of Sokovia was beginning to lift off the ground, as the Avengers could do nothing but watch. The evacuated people watched in horror as their town was being lifted towards the sky while those who remained were either crushed by falling debris or falling below. Ultron began to boast on how the Earth will crack from the weight of the Avengers' failures and that no matter what they do, it means nothing to him. Once he completes his plan of global extinction, the only thing that will be left in the world will be metal. Back underground, Black Widow and Bruce Banner shared a kiss, only for Natasha to push him into a pit and forcing him to change into the Hulk. The Hulk along with Black Widow leaped above towards the ascending slab of the city and landed in a forest before they split up to destroy the drones and protect the civilians. After Iron Man rescued a family from a collapsing apartment, Captain America ordered the Avengers to destroy the Ultron Sentries and if they get harmed they harm the opponents in return and if they get killed then they should \"walk it off\" . Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye were rescuing civilians while they fought off the Ultrone drones. As Hawkeye grabbed Scarlet Witch and took cover inside a house from an oncoming Ultron drone, Wanda began to panic as she felt great guilt in joining Ultron and allowing this to happen. Hawkeye stated that now is not the time to be afraid, and despite being a human with a bow and arrow, he does this because it is his job. He can't do a job and babysit at the same time, it no longer matters what she did and what she was. What matters is that she fights to protect, and when she does she becomes an Avenger. He then went out and continued to fight off the Sentries. Back in the city at the bridge, two cars were about to fall from the shattered edge. Captain America attempted to save on but the fender dislodged and the two cars fell below. Thor intercepted one of the cars and tossed the woman that was in it back to Captain America as he lifted the second car back up to the bridge. Black Widow joined the battle, using her electric batons to fight off the drones. Captain America and Thor worked in tandem, as Thor batted Cap's shield with enough force to ricochet it off of several drones while simultaneously. Thor destroyed many of the drones effortlessly which irritated Ultron and took him away from his allies. Hawkeye continued to destroy as many drones as he could, but more piled on regardless. However, Scarlet Witch soon joined the fray and used her hex bolts to destroy the Ultron Sentries while using her telekinesis to dismember them. After destroying them, she was carried off by Quicksilver. Ultron tossed Thor back at the church and began to pummel him savagely. Iron Man was trying to find solutions as to how to stop Ultron's plan, and realized that he should redirect the energy back at the thrusters to overload, but F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated that would take the city and everyone else on it. The Avengers, thinking that they were going down along with the city, were then shocked and surprised to see that Nick Fury, along with Maria Hill and several other former S.H.I.E.L.D. had arrived with a Helicarrier to rescue the stranded civilians. The Ultron drones were about to attack the Helicarrier only for Nick Fury to deploy Rhodes in his new War Machine armor and began to destroy the attacking drones with Iron Man joining the fray alongside his comrade. Ultron continued to beat Thor before putting him in a choke hold saying that once he turns the key he will cause the city to plummet down and kill billions of humans despite saving the people on it. Thor began to distract Ultron as Vision soon regained consciousness and whacked Ultron away with Mj\u00f8lnir before returning it to Thor. While Iron Man fought off the sentries, one of the bots destroyed the propellers for the evacuation pods causing Iron Man to prevent it from falling. Thor then called out to the Avengers that the drones are coming for the core to activate it. Iron Man told Rhodey to rescue the other civilians while they regrouped back at the church. After they all met up, Ultron soon confronted them all and summoned a massive armada of his sentries in response to Thor's challenge and to Captain America's dismay. After Ultron questioned on how they could stop him, Iron Man replied \"together\" . This prompts the legion of drones to all attack the Avengers. The heroes then work in tandem and began to destroy any drone that attempted to go near the machine. Captain America using his shield and fighting prowess, Black Widow using her martial arts skills and taser batons, Hawkeye using his arrows and bow, Vision using his density altering powers, Scarlet Witch using her hex bolts and telekinesis, Quicksilver using his speed and friction, Thor using his hammer and lightning, Iron Man using his repulsor blasts, and Hulk using his fists as they all fought off the robotic army. Ultron, shouting with rage, attacked himself and began with the Vision. The Vision then blasted him away with a beam of energy from the Mind Stone on his forehead, prompting Thor and Iron Man to join him as they blasted Ultron with repulsor beams and lightning bolts respectively slowly melting his shell away before stopping. Weakened and damaged, Ultron was punched away by the Hulk and forcing the drones to all escape. Iron Man ordered the Avengers to stop them from leaving and destroy them should Ultron download himself into one of them when he is destroyed. War Machine was joined by the Vision to destroy the airborne drones much to his bewilderment. Captain America then ordered the other Avengers to retreat to the boats, however, Scarlet Witch volunteered to remain behind to protect the core in order to prevent a drone from activating it. Unbeknownst to them, a damaged Ultron makes his way to the Quinjet. Hawkeye drops Black Widow off near the Hulk's location in order for her to calm him down and revert him back to normal, unfortunately this was prevented after Black Widow and the Hulk recieved a hail of bullets from the Quinjet which was controlled by Ultron. Meanwhile, Hawkeye left the boat in order to rescue a Sokovian woman's son but soon realized he was in the line of fire as the bullets from the Quinjet were racing towards him. Before the killing blow was struck, Hawkeye and the boy were saved by Quicksilver as he sped past them, taking the bullets instead and dies from his wounds. Scarlet Witch senses this and screams in pure anguish at the loss of her brother. Hawkeye carries off the dead Quicksilver to the boat while Captain America takes away the boy. Hulk is then seen carrying Black Widow before landing on the Helicarrier, dropping her there before he lunges towards the Quinjet. He removes Ultron from the controls as the A.I. crashes into a train car. Scarlet Witch finds Ultron and rips his central core out of his body in revenge for him killing her brother. However, because she left her post, Ultron was able to take control of a damaged sentry and activate the machine. Thrusters went into reverse thrust in order to increase the devestation of the impact as Sokovia plummets towards the Earth below. Iron Man uses his Unibeam to counteract the energy being given off through the vibranium engine while Thor summons a massive bolt of lightning. Vision flies through the rubble and saves Scarlet Witch at the last moment before Thor swings Mjolnir down with incredible force, using the power from the lightning and completely destroying the slab of Sokovia through the mechanism itself. Black Widow attempts to reach the Hulk through the Quinjet, informing him to deactivate the stealth mode in order for them to track him. However, the Hulk simply cuts out the transmission much to Black Widow's shock. The Hulk remains within the Quinjet as he along with the ship drift through the skies. Ultron on the other hand, survived through a final Ultron Sentry. But he was then confronted by the Vision who noticed that he was afraid of death. The two engaged in a rather friendly conversation before they shared their respective views of humanity. While they both agreed that humans are flawed and are doomed to self destruction, Vision points out that they have faith in attempting to achieve their accomplishments and destroys the attacking drone, ending the threat of Ultron. Thor travels away from Earth for search the Infinity Stones and to discovers what his hallucinations reference about and he say hello to Tony and Cap after he travels away thanks to the Bifrost. Thor: Ragnarok Thor has spended his time to search the Infinity Stones but he didn't find them and he's being captured by the fire demon Surtur who tell to him who Odin is not longer on Asgard and his absence haved left the throne defensless, Surtur tell to Thor who he's ready to make Ragnarok, the end of Asgard and with the destruction of Thor's home he will finally die, Thor free himself from his cages thanks to Myolnir and he steal Surtur's crown killing Surtur and he's convinced who killing Surtur he haved stopped Ragnarok, so Thor escape from Surtur's palace and with Surtur's crown he's chased by the Fire Dragon until he's saved by the Bifrost who teletrasporta him into Asgard where Thor meets the new guardian of the Bifrost, his old friend Skurge who reveal to him who Odin haved fired Heimdall for betrayal but he's disappeared before the execution, Thor go in the central of Asgard where he found a statue of Loki and discovers who Loki is alive, Loki haved faked his death and haved stealed the throne disguised himself as Odin and then Loki is watching a opera on his fake death disguised as Odin, Thor force Loki to reveal his true sembiances and identity to the whole Asgard and unmask Loki, after Loki haved reveal himself Thor asks him where is the real Odin and Loki answer him who he don't haved killed Odin but simply banish him into Earth and then the two brothers thanks to the Bifrost go to Earth, specifically in New York.

Personality Thor is a noble warrior and a man of honor. He has dislike of mortal technology and science for creating supervillains and admires heroes with courage, honour, compassion, and the gift of battle. He was very wise about mortal tales and criticizing villains about their abilities they boasted Originally, he was very arrogant, full of himself, and sought battle to prove his strength, heroism, and was short-sighted, acting on impulse or however he felt justified. For his actions and inexcusable behavior, Odin stripped Thor of his powers, titles, and rights, banishing him to Midgard until he proved himself worthy of his Asgardian power. On Earth, Thor was an arrogant stranger and quickly fell into depression when his brother lied to him and how he could not lift Mjolnir. However, he fell in love with Jane <mark>Foster</mark> and quickly learnt humility and wisdom. This changed him so much that he was even willing to stand up to Loki and protect the Frost Giants, his enemies. Physical Appearance Thor is a very tall Asgardian. He has blonde hair, fair skin, and blue eyes. He has very large arm muscles and long legs. He wears a silver Viking-style helmet, red cape, black armor with silver circles, red wristbands, silver chain mail sleeves, large golden belt, blue tights, and tall golden boots. In Ragnarok, his hair was cut short and his right eye was cut off by his sister Hela, however in Avengers: Infinity War Thor have a elettronic eye by Rocket as a replacement for the original eye.

However, some of his attributes are considerably more developed than those of the vast majority of his race. Thor is the second most powerful Asgardian in the Nine Realms, second only to his father, Odin the All-Father. Thor is a Norse warrior god, trained and skilled in the arts of battle, which he has practiced for thousands of years. He is recognized to relying solely on his superior fighting ability, strength, and nigh invulnerability. Following his banishment to Earth, Thor greatly withholds his power unless fighting someone with similar strength and durability. Due to his immense power and disciplined perspective, Thor often has to hold back during a fight due to the destruction his strength may cause to his surroundings, such as his fight on the Helicarrier with Hulk. When he does let loose with his powers, Thor is capable of decimating much of his surroundings, such as when he shattered an entire ice shelf during a battle on Jotunheim. Powers Asgardian Physiology: As an Asgardian, Thor has several superhuman abilities. Superhuman Strength: As an Asgardian, specifically the son of Odin, Thor is the strongest Asgardian alive, apart from Odin himself. His incredible superhuman strength enables him to overpower normal humans, Frost Giants, Chitauri aliens, Dark Elves, Ultron Sentries, and various other species within or beyond the Nine Realms. He can lift or move immensely heavy objects effortlessly and can tear through traditionally durable objects, such as Iron Man's gauntlets, like crushing paper. Thor's strength extends to his ability to leap great distances. With his strength, Thor is able to take on multiple enemies at once, using Mj\u00f8lnir to send large groups of enemies, like the Frost Giants, the Chitauri, or Ultron Sentries flying one by one with each strike. Using his weapon Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor's strength is compounded, as he is able to swing his mighty hammer with great speed and force. Thor's strength is so great, that he can throw his hammer with enough force to break through nearly any barrier, whether it be stone, metal or dark energy. His strength is so great, that strikes with Mj\u00f8lnir are usually fatal, knocking out opponents with one hit, and only beings of incredible power, like Hulk and Malekith, can take multiple direct hits from Thor. Hence, Thor was able to shatter a massive Kronan, take down a Leviathan, and even break the Bifrost Bridge, all with only several blows of his hammer. Thor's immense strength also enabled him to break out of an extremely durable confinement capsule (specifically designed to hold the Hulk), stop a mighty punch from the Hulk with his own hand, and punch the latter in the face hard enough to make him stagger. Thor also went toe-to-toe in a prolonged battle against Malekith, whose strength was greatly compounded by the Aether, and ultimately defeated him. During the Battle of Sokovia, Thor was able to easily catch a falling car with one arm, saving the family trapped inside it. Superhuman Speed: Thor can move at extreme superhuman speeds. Thor tackled the Hulk through the wall of the Helicarrier in a split second, visibly appearing as a blur. Using Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor can fly at high speeds, moving across the New Mexico desert in a matter of seconds. While flying Thor can use his speed to strike enemies with immense force, such as when he killed a large creature on Jotunheim by flying through it's skull. He can also swing Mj\u00f8lnir at such high speeds that it seems like a blur to the naked eye. Superhuman Agility: Thor's agility, balance, and bodily coordination make him a great warrior for battle. He moves with incredible grace and speed despite his considerable size and body density. He was able to dodge the wing of a jet fighter thrown at him by the Hulk while they battled in the hangar bay of the Helicarrier. Superhuman Durability: Thor's skin, muscle, and bone tissue have many times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being, making him Virtually Invulnerable. Even when he was stripped of his powers, Thor was still amazingly resilient due to his dense body, withstanding several energy blasts from the Destroyer. When he is at full power and armed with Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor possesses nigh-invulnerability, including resistance to powerful energy blasts, immense blunt force trauma, falls from great heights, explosions and various other opposing forces. He survived a direct near point blank range blast from Gungnir blasting him out of Odin's chamber, and falling several hundred feet to the ground, showing no visible signs of injury. Thor withstood a 400% - charged repulsor blast from Iron Man, was barely affected by Quicksilver smashing into him at supersonic speeds, and even a mighty punch from Hulk only gave him a nosebleed. During his final battle with Malekith, Thor was even able to survive being hit by quite a few tendrils of the Aether Infinity Stone energy, without any permanent damage. When he is injured, Thor's physique allows him to shrug off minor injuries such as small stab wounds from Asgardian blades, or allows him to withstand a direct blow in the face from a massive Frost Giant and laugh afterwards. However, when matched with a rare enemy that is stronger than himself, like the Kursed Algrim, Thor will eventually sustain injuries and increasingly show signs of exertion and fatigue. Superhuman Stamina: Thor's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of a human and most other Asgardians. As a result, his muscles produce practically no fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to those of humans and most other members of his race. His virtually inexhaustible stamina enables him to exert himself at peak capacity for an undefined period of time without tiring at all. Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it is possible to injure Thor. However, due to his Asgardian physiology, Thor is able to heal at a rate much faster than a normal human being. After seemingly being killed by the Destroyer and proving himself worthy of Mj\u00f8lnir once again, Thor regained his full power and immediately healed himself in seconds. Despite receiving mild to sever stab wounds from Asgardian blades on several occasions, after working past the initial pain of the injury, Thor was able to quickly recover and continue fighting. After the brutal beating he suffered from Algrim on Svartalfheim, upon arriving to Earth, he had nearly completely recovered. Longevity: Thor, like all other Asgardians, is not truly immortal as it is possible to kill an Asgardian and other beings in the Nine Realms. More accurately Asgardians are extremely long lived beings. Thor ages at a pace far, far slower than a human being as he is at least 1,000 or more years old; more than likely born shortly before the last great war between the Asgardians and the Jotuns. Weather Control: Thor as an Asgardian and son of Odin, was born with the natural ability to control weather even though his relying on Mj\u00f8lnir has caused a lack of practice, and so he has displayed weather control only few times without relying on the hammer. This power is seemingly also tied to his emotions. So far, he has only displayed creating rain and electricity without Mj\u00f8lnir. Electrokinesis: As a part of his weather control powers, Thor can generate electricity from his body without relying on Mj\u00f8lnir. Abilities Expert Combatant: Thor is the greatest and most powerful warrior in Asgard since Odin, and is one of the most skilled fighters to ever walk the planet. Thor is a superbly skilled warrior trained in the arts of war and various fighting techniques by his teachers in Asgard. He is proficient, even masterful in numerous areas of combat, including hand-to-hand and various forms of weaponry available in Asgard, including spears and swords with over centuries of combat experience. He is known to be very cunning and intuitive in battles and in warfare, having fought and defeated over a hundred warriors in Nornheim and battle hordes of Frost Giants with great ease in Jotunheim. He was able to fight and gain the advantage with nearly a dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives, while powerless weakened and mortal, with only his vast fighting skills and experience, as Coulson stated \"he made [his] men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops.\" He was able to maneuver around the larger Hulk and strike him with ease. He also went toe to toe with the highly skilled Dark Elf Malekith, and ultimately defeated him after a prolonged battle. During the Battle of Sokovia, Thor fought and destroyed many Ultron Sentries effortlessly, prompting an irritated Ultron to tackle him away and deal with him personally. \"It's all in the swing.\" --Thor to Vision. Hammer Mastery: After centuries of practice wielding his hammer, Thor is a master of fighting with Mj\u00f8lnir and is proficient in hammer throwing. He can even block several energy shots with Mj\u00f8lnir, from the Destroyer, Loki's staff and Chitauri weaponry. Master Tactician: For centuries he has lead Asgard, including Sif and the Warriors Three, into battle against forces with great leadership and employing strategies and tactics adapted from various civilizations across the Nine Realms, including forgotten ones. Equipment Mj\u00f8lnir \"You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.\" --Captain America to Thor, on the attack of the Chitauri. Thor has been entrusted with the mighty hammer Mj\u00f8lnir, that was forged from the heart of a dying star. Thor's mystical hammer Mj\u00f8lnir, which resembles a mallet rather than a traditional war hammer, has a number of elemental based powers. It has been stated by Odin himself that Mj\u00f8lnir's power has no equal. Mj\u00f8lnir itself is extremely durable, and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, it is, for all intents and purposes, indestructible. It has deflected three blast from the Destroyer (which was able to disintegrate anything that it hit) and return the blast back into the Destroyer. Thor often uses the hammer as a physical weapon, with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer blow or throw (with the exception of Captain America's Shield). A few examples of the abilities Thor has shown with Mj\u00f8lnir are: Weather Control: Wielding Mj\u00f8lnir grants Thor the ability to control the elements of a storm. It can control the elements and can create giant raging electrical storms complete with thunder, lightning, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, tidal waves, earthquakes, and torrential rains on a moment's notice. He summoned an isolated class 5 tornado while battling the Destroyer, as well as summoning lightning bolt strong enough to destroy a large piece of landscape in Jotunheim. The Norse myths and legends regarded him as a Thunder God because of the hammer's influence over the weather. Lightning: Thor's main weapon while using Mj\u00f8lnir is the ability to summon a lightning bolt from the surrounding skyline. While it is unable to generate electricity on its own, Mj\u00f8lnir is able to attract the ambient electricity from the surrounding atmosphere and redirect it towards a given target. However, this also puts a limit on the extent to which Thor can use this power at any given time. While on Jotunheim, Thor summoned a lightning bolt strong enough to destroy a large piece of landscape. During the Battle of New York he used the spire of the Chrysler building to channel a massive lightning bolt, which he directed at the portal of the Chitauri to deter a portion of the enemy reinforcements. Worthiness Enchantment: After Thor disobeyed Odin and nearly caused a war between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin banished Thor to Earth without his powers and placed an enchantment on the hammer Mj\u00f8lnir. \"Who so ever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\" This enchantment surrounding Mj\u00f8lnir prevents it from being wielded by anyone save those who have been found worthy. When Thor sacrificed himself to protect Earth from The Destroyer he proved himself worthy to wield Mj\u00f8lnir once again and gained full use of his powers. Only Thor, Odin, and Vision are able to wield Mj\u00f8lnir. Other than that, none who have tried to lift it have managed to make it move. Not even the Hulk's incredible strength could lift Mj\u00f8lnir. \"Is this how you normally look?\" \"More or less.\" --Jane <mark>Foster</mark> and Thor Material Transformation: By summoning lightning from the sky into Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor's clothes are transformed into his armor. Mystical Link: Mj\u00f8lnir obeys Thor's commands as though it were driven by a form of intelligence. Mj\u00f8lnir went to Thor when it was in a crater miles away, arriving in seconds. Mj\u00f8lnir will return to Thor whenever he throws it at an opponent. While battling the Hulk in a hanger of the Helicarrier, Thor summoned Mj\u00f8lnir from another room and it came crashing through the Helicarrier to get to him. Massive Speed Flight: Thor is capable of hurling Mj\u00f8lnir with great force and, by holding onto the leather thong, is capable of flying through the air at tremendous speeds. How fast is not specified, but he was able to remain aloft in the middle of a Class 5 tornado, and traverse the distance from his father's chambers to Heimdall's observatory and back again in seconds. Immense Speed: Thor is capable of hurling Mj\u00f8lnir at great speeds by holding onto the leather thong. In Jotunheim, he bashes the Frost Giants around him, then throws Mj\u00f8lnir, making it hit multiple Frost Giants in it's path in moments. Energy Projection: With Mj\u00f8lnir, Thor can project powerful mystical blasts of energy. He can even channel energies for stronger energy attacks. With Mj\u00f8lnir, Odin projects a powerful mystical blast of energy using it to channel an energy blast through it, taking away all of Thor's superhuman powers and destroys what was left of Thor's armor after stripping much of it off of him and throwing him into the Bifrost. Indestructible: The Hammer is virtually unbreakable, nothing is able to shatter, dent or destroy it. Other Equipment Armor First Set: His first set of armor had a collared blue tunic with red piping, and black pants. Over the blue shirt he wore a black vest emblazoned with silver overlay. He wore a bright red cape that connected at the shoulders of his vest. His arms were covered in a form of chain-mail and he wore detailed, black, knee-high boots. Second Set: Thor's second set of armor worn while fighting in the forest with Captain America and Iron Man. It was sleeveless with a black top covered in silver plates. It has blue pants and black boots. It had red wrist bands covered with silver arm bracers. It also had a bright red cape. During Thor's stay on the Helicarrier he removed portions of his armor such as his cape, larger arm bracers and part of his chest plate, while in the more relaxed setting. While heading into the Battle of New York he re-donned his cape and heavier portions of his armor, adding to it a set of chain-mail sleeves as seen in the first set. Third Set: The Third set was a layered, collared, black vest with gold plates and blue accents worn over a chain-mail shirt. The vest continued into a loincloth which hung over chain-mail and leather pants. The sleeves ended at arm-bracers similar-looking to the vest with a red underside. He wore knee-high brown boots with gold piping. The fifth set also featured a bright red cape that was attached to the vest by two gold disks.
