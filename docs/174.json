daily news delivered direct to your inbox rosy future...sunderland loan star <mark>danny rose</mark>. published on monday 17 september 2012 09:20 debutant <mark>danny rose</mark> hopes his loan switch to sunderland will result in a permanent move to the stadium of light. england under-21 left-back <mark>rose</mark> made his black cats bow in saturday's 1-1 draw with liverpool after arriving on a season-long loan from spurs on transfer deadline day. the loan deal has no clause regarding a permanent transfer, and <mark>rose</mark> has not been given any indication from sunderland boss <mark>martin o'neill</mark> that he sees him as part of his long-term plans. but the doncaster-born playing is already looking to stay on wearside by impressing <mark>o'neill</mark> after seeing sunderland's ambition in the transfer market this summer. <mark>rose</mark> told the gazette: \"if there was a chance that i could move here permanently, i'd snatch it with both hands .\" nothing has been said of that kind. i'm just here on loan for the season, and anything after that would be a bonus. \"the gaffer just asked me to come here on loan and said i'd play more games here than i would at spurs, which is right .\" i've just got to take it game by game, and see where it takes me. \"i had interest from a couple of clubs, but once i saw the signings that sunderland had made, it was a no-brainer, and with being closer to my family as well, that helps .\" <mark>adam johnson</mark> has come from man city. he could have gone to a host of premier league clubs, but he came here. \"louis saha i was with last season, and they paid big money for <mark>steven fletcher</mark>. it just shows sunderland's intent for the season .\" <mark>rose</mark> underwent treatment on a groin strain at the academy of light yesterday - an injury which proved costly to sunderland's hopes of recording a first league victory of the campaign. the 22-year-old was struggling with the problem for several minutes before he was beaten by liverpool winger raheem sterling on the right-hand touchline, who crossed for <mark>luis suarez</mark> to level for the visitors. <mark>rose</mark> was honest enough to admit he was at fault for the goal, but says liverpool merited a point after piling on the pressure in the second half following <mark>fletcher</mark>'s third in two games for the black cats. \"just before the goal, i told <mark>john o'shea</mark> i was struggling with my groin,\" said <mark>rose</mark>. \"i said i'd give it five more minutes and look what happened .\" i don't think it's too bad, it just seems tight. i might have over-stretched for a ball, i don't know. \"hopefully when everything settles down with my body, we can assess it .\" he added: \"i was a bit disappointed with the goal which was my fault .\" i should have done better out wide and it's ricocheted off titus (bramble) and he's (<mark>suarez</mark>) tapped it in. \"it just shows at this level that you let your opponent get the better of you once, he puts it in the box and liverpool scored .\" liverpool did dominate if i'm honest. they play good football. \"obviously they've been a big unlucky with their results so far, but they dominated and we were happy with a point. transfer rumours: sunday september 9: man united, cristiano ronaldo, arsenal, theo walcott, chelsea, swansea, liverpool temperature:

was suspended for three games tuesday by the blue jays for wearing eye-black displaying a homophobic slur written in spanish during a game last weekend against boston. escobar apologized \"to all those who have been offended\" for what he said was meant to be \"just a joke .\" \"it was not something i intended to be offensive,\" he said through a translator. \"it was not anything intended to be directed at anyone in particular .\" the suspension - issued after input from commissioner bud selig, the players' union and team management - was to have started tuesday night at yankee stadium. the game between toronto and new york was rained out. as part of his penalty, escobar's lost salary during the ban - about $82,000 - will be directed to two advocacy groups, the gay & lesbian alliance against defamation and you can play. escobar will also take part in an outreach initiative to promote tolerance to others based on their sexual orientation, and participate in a sensitivity training program. pictures posted online showed the 29-year-old cuban infielder with the message written in his eye-black, a sticker players wear under their eyes to reduce sun glare, during saturday's home game against boston. major league baseball regulations prohibit derogatory words and symbols on uniforms. writing something of that nature on eye-black would fall under that category, mlb spokesman pat courtney said. \"mr. escobar has admitted that his actions were a mistake and i am hopeful he can use this unfortunate situation as an opportunity to educate himself and others that intolerance has no place in our game or society,\" selig said in a statement. glaad president herndon graddick commended the decision. \"today's actions show that mlb and the toronto blue jays are committed to creating an environment that all fans and families can enjoy, not a place where discriminatory language and anti-gay attitudes are accepted,\" graddick said in a statement. in may 2011, mlb suspended atlanta pitching coach roger mcdowell for two weeks without pay for inappropriate comments and gestures with homophobic and sexual overtones he made toward fans before a game in san francisco. meta

"republican presidential candidate mitt romney speaks at the faith and freedom coalition in washington june 3, 2011. (reuters) may 12, 2012: mitt romney speaks at the liberty university commencement ceremony in lynchburg, va. reuters next slide previous slide nearly one year ago i ignited a national discussion about mitt romney's religious faith by labeling mormonism as a \"cult .\" although i readily acknowledged that romney's mormonism did not disqualify him from the presidency (and that i would prefer him to president obama), i did predict that if romney became the republican nominee, president obama would win a second term. i'm now willing to admit my prognostication may have been premature for several reasons. i had based my prediction of romney's defeat on the belief that enough evangelicals would stay at home in november due to a lack of enthusiasm for a romney presidency. some evangelical christians have been troubled by romney's mormonism, while others are disturbed by his lack of a consistent, conservative record on social issues. since evangelicals historically have voted overwhelmingly for republicans, it would not take many evangelicals sitting out this election to ensure an obama victory. for example, in 2004 george w. bush garnered 79 percent of the evangelical vote and won a second term; yet, in 2008 john mccain captured 73 percent of the evangelical vote and lost to barack obama. i had no reason to think that evangelicals would be any more enthused about mitt romney than they were about john mccain. but over the last 11 months three developments have changed my mind about romney's appeal to evangelical voters. first, many evangelical christians are incensed by the obama administration's relentless assaults on religious freedom. in october of 2011, the obama justice department argued before the supreme court in the case of hosanna-tabor evangelical lutheran church and school v. eeoc that the ministerial exemption to federal hiring standards should be rescinded. the revocation of that exemption would mean that churches could be forced to violate their doctrinal beliefs and hire homosexuals as pastors or women as priests. an astonished supreme court asked the obama representative if the federal government should have jurisdiction over whom a church hired as its minister and the representative said \"yes .\" fortunately, the supreme court unanimously rejected that claim. yet, the fact that the obama administration would state such a position should be chilling to people of any faith. i had no reason to think that evangelicals would be any more enthused about mitt romney than they were about john mccain. but over the last 11 months three developments have changed my mind about romney's appeal to evangelical voters. - evangelicals were similarly angered in january, 2012 by the mandate issued by u.s. department of health and human services requiring organizations to provide contraceptives, sterilization services, and abortion-inducing drugs to its employees. although there was a narrow religious exemption to this order, religious charities and hospitals were required to violate their beliefs and offer these \"benefits .\" in a demonstration of spiritual solidarity, evangelicals and catholics joined together to protest this outrageous example of governmental overreach into religious institutions. to date, there has been no satisfactory resolution of this crisis and both pastors and priests have said they would choose prison over compliance with obama's edict. a second milestone development this past year was president obama's public approval of homosexual marriage in may of 2012 which has both energized efforts of evangelical republicans and at the same time diminished his support among evangelical democrats (primarily hispanics and african-americans). one does not have to be a homophobe to understand that it is impossible to reconcile homosexual marriage with the teaching of jesus christ who described god's design for marriage as one man and one woman in a lifetime relationship (matthew 19:4 -6). any deviation from that standard-adultery, polygamy, pre-marital sex, or homosexuality-is a sin according traditional christian and jewish teaching. beyond the theological objection to homosexual marriage, evangelicals see a flood of societal problems that will be unleashed on a country that attempts to redefine marriage. numerous studies have demonstrated that depression, incarceration, and even suicide are more prevalent among children who are not reared by their biological father and mother. princeton university sociologist sara mclanahan and others have noted that the ideal situation for a child is to be in a family with both biological parents. that reality may have been the impetus for cardinal timothy dolan's benediction at the democratic national convention (which had just adopted a platform supporting homosexual marriage .) \"empower us with your grace, so that we might resist the temptation to replace the moral law with idols of our own making, or to remake those institutions you have given us for the nurturing of life and community .\" president obama's support of homosexual marriage is not only igniting support among evangelical republicans but will also suppress voter turnout among evangelical african-americans and hispanics. i have a number of minorities in my church who voted for president obama in 2008 but are finding it difficult to support him in 2012 because they cannot reconcile his stance on homosexual marriage with their christian faith. they are insulted by those who would compare the fight for \"marriage equality\" with their centuries-long struggle for civil rights. as one african-american clergyman in our area said, \"don't equate sin with the color of my skin!\" these evangelical christian minorities are not going to suddenly transform into republican supporters of mitt romney. they will simply sit out this election which in a close election could be enough to deny president obama a second term. finally, romney's selection of <mark>paul ryan</mark> as his running mate sent a strong signal to evangelicals that they would have someone in the white house who represents their values. had romney picked a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate like former secretary of state condoleezza rice or new jersey governor chris christie, it would have only confirmed many evangelicals' suspicion about romney-that his conversion to conservatism was a matter of convenience rather than conviction. however, <mark>paul ryan</mark>'s strong pro-life record and unapologetic support for traditional marriage have assured evangelicals that when it comes time to nominate the next supreme court justice there will be someone at the table who represents their values. i don't pretend to know whether mitt romney will win on november 6. however, i am certain that president obama's hard turn to the left and romney's selection of <mark>paul ryan</mark> have made mitt romney much more palatable to evangelical christians-like me. dr. robert jeffress is pastor of the 11,000-member first baptist church in dallas, texas and hosts a daily radio program heard on 722 stations nationwide. print email share comments recommend tweet related video mitt romney responds to \"secret video' on neil cavuto related stories could religion tip the election? poll: qualms about mormonism widespread, but may not impact romney's run for the presidency", "articleID": "2012091917_00033285_W", "names": {"Paul Ryan": ["Q15610524", "Q16194779", "Q16196240", "Q19849048", "Q203966", "Q2062095", "Q2363728", "Q7153372", "Q7153373", "Q7153374"]}}]
