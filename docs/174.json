company's salmonella testing washington a georgia peanut plant knowingly shipped salmonella-laced products as far back as 2007, at times sending out tainted products after tests confirmed contamination, according to inspection records released yesterday. officials with the food and drug administration earlier had said that peanut corp. of america waited for a second test to clear peanut butter and peanuts that initially were positive for salmonella. but the fda amended its report yesterday, saying that the plant in blakely, ga., shipped some products before receiving the second test and sold others after confirming salmonella. federal law forbids producing or shipping foods under conditions that could make it harmful to consumers' health. in 2007, the company shipped chopped peanuts july 18 and 24 after salmonella was confirmed by private lab tests. peanut corp. sold products \"on or after the positive salmonella results were obtained,\" the fda report says. in other cases, the company did not wait for a second round of salmonella tests. \"in some instances, peanut products were shipped by (the company) prior to having assurance that the products were negative for salmonella,\" said <mark>michael rogers</mark>, the head of field investigations for the fda. <mark>rogers</mark> said that the fda made the discovery after a more detailed analysis of records submitted by the company. at least eight deaths have been attributed to the salmonella outbreak, as have 575 illnesses in 43 states. the justice department has opened a criminal investigation. more than 1,550 products have been recalled. an attorney for peanut corp. said that the company is investigating what happened at the plant and had no comment on the latest fda findings. \"we have not made a determination yet on liability,\" attorney amy rotenberg said. \"we are neither denying or admitting liability at this point. we are still investigating .\" peanut corp. previously said it \"categorically denies any allegations\" that it sought lab results that would put its products in a favorable light. problems at the plant aren't new. fda inspectors found in 2001 that products potentially were exposed to insecticides, one of several violations uncovered during the last visit made before the current food scare, according to a report obtained by the associated press. also yesterday, agriculture secretary tom vilsack said he supports merging the nation's food-safety system into one agency. his department shares duties now with the fda. the usda abruptly suspended all business with the company this week. it shipped some of the company's potentially contaminated peanut butter and peanuts to eight states, including school - lunch programs in california, minnesota and idaho in 2007. none of the states reported illnesses as a result of people eating the products, agency officials said. some of the problems that the fda discovered at the plant in 2001 are similar to those found last month, when federal inspectors returned to the plant after nearly eight years. the 2001 inspection found dead insects near peanuts and holes in the plant big enough for rodents to enter. the inspectors discovered that workers at the plant used an insecticide fogger in food-processing areas and did not wash the exposed equipment. they also found dirty duct tape wrapped on broken equipment. fda inspectors did not find evidence of insecticides in peanuts at the plant during that visit. company officials told them that the fogger was last used two weeks earlier, according to the inspection report. the usda was one of peanut corp.'s two biggest clients at the time. usda officials also regularly visited the plant, including in recent years. but those agency workers were not trained to perform food-safety inspections, a usda spokesman said. the usda visits to the plant were made by \"contract auditors\" who are \"number crunchers,\" redding said, who know nothing about peanuts. blogs take a look at the multitude of journalnow blogs, including reports from nascar reporter mike mulhern, parenting advice from paul garber, and cooking tips from food editor <mark>michael

layoff with the magnitude of the game. the winner will claim first place in the conference with just a month remaining before selection sunday. \"we tried to keep them busy with video and practice,

campus roads and parking lots, university of maryland students haven't had classes since feb. 4. at the terps' 92-71 victory against the tar heels on sunday, administrators allowed between 2,000 and 3,000 students without tickets into the comcast center, knowing many season-ticket holders would be unable to make the treacherous drive to college park. <mark>williams</mark> said the team prepared monday and tuesday as if it were going to play the cavaliers on wednesday. that game was officially postponed tuesday afternoon. \"then that switched to duke. that was good in terms of not having six days to get ready,\" <mark>williams</mark> said. \"in other words, we were in a game situation--we were gonna play wednesday night. we were getting ready for that. then when that switched, you have that little comedown, maybe emotionally, but you can switch teams .\" this duke team, while ranked in the top 10, has shown that it's vulnerable inside and on the bench in losses to wisconsin, north carolina state and georgetown. but the blue devils (20-4, 8-2 acc) have easily handled conference opponents at home. their average margin of victory in acc play in front of the cameron crazies is 18.8

well that just means you can't win, and we've won down there before. we've won by playing our game. \"the terps' game lately has been stellar defensive play inside, efficient 3-point shooting, and the
