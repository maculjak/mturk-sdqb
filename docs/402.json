The hack was revealed by OurMine in a blog post. Data including one-sheets on featured artists and marketing materials, supposedly 3.12 terabytes worth, was posted to OurMine's website. Hours later, Vevo requested that the stolen info be taken down, and OurMine removed it. In an email to NPR, OurMine, which operates anonymously, claims it did not initially intend to post the data publicly and tried to alert Vevo of the breach privately, but that Vevo responded, \"F *** off, you don't have anything .\" OurMine shared a screenshot of that exchange, which lacked any identifying information and so could not be verified as taking place between the two, with NPR. Vevo would not verify the exchange to NPR when asked. Why was Vevo targeted? In its email to NPR, OurMine wrote, \"Every month we pick random companies to check their security and Vevo was one of them .\" (So it was not this 2016 tweet .) Asked for particulars about the hack, such as when it learned of the attack, whether any user data was posted publicly, when it requested its data be removed from public availability and what steps it was taking to prevent future attacks, Vevo issued this statement: \"We can confirm that Vevo experienced a data breach as a result of a phishing scam via LinkedIn. We have addressed the issue and are investigating the extent of exposure .\" In addition to posting private documents publicly, OurMine is also a business, offering its security services to both individuals (for $30) and companies (price upon request). While high-profile hacks of companies like Vevo and individuals like the singer Troye Sivan and tech mogul Mark Zuckerberg (password: \"dadada\" ) act as marketing for the company--generating articles like the one you're reading now--OurMine says that's not the point of its activities. \"We are doing this to improve the world security, as we said before we start all the hacks we did. No one is safe from hackers, even us!\" According to the group's own posts that doesn't seem to be the whole truth--its hack of BuzzFeed Media in Oct., 2016, appeared to be retaliatory, \"because they are reporting fake news about us .\" The group posted on BuzzFeed's website a warning: \"don't share fake news about us again, we have your database. Next time it will be public. Don't f *** with OurMine again .\" Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http: //www.npr.org/.

(Reuters) - California lawmakers voted to become a sanctuary state, tussled over hot-button environmental issues and urged other states to refuse to cooperate with President Donald Trump's Election Integrity Commission as their legislative year ended early on Saturday. The majority Democratic lawmakers headed back to their districts having positioned the state in opposition to conservative policies proposed by the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump on immigration, the environment and other issues. \"It's a purposeful positioning,\" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California. \"We have a different political path and a different ideological path than the Republican-controlled Congress and White House have .\" This year, California lawmakers have strengthened protections for undocumented immigrants, increased the gasoline tax and extended a program aimed at compelling businesses to reduce air pollution, all in opposition to federal policies. Early on Saturday, lawmakers gave last-minute support to a bill barring local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail just to allow enforcement officers to take them into their custody. The bill, a compromise from a version that sought to severely restrict interactions between law enforcement and immigration officials, does allow communities to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. It also allows enforcement agents access to local jails. It came a day after a federal judge barred the U.S. Justice Department from denying public-safety grants to so-called sanctuary cities in retaliation for limiting cooperation with the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The bill goes now to Democratic Governor <mark>Jerry Brown</mark> for his signature. Trump issued an executive order in January targeting funding for cities that offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. A San Francisco judge blocked the order. Illinois' Republican Governor signed a bill last month protecting people from being detained because they are the subject of an immigration-related warrant. FOSSIL FUELS Although California lawmakers have enacted several environmental protections this year, a measure aimed at weaning the state's power grid entirely off fossil fuels by 2045 died for the year after lawmakers adjourned without voting on it. California's three investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric [SDGE. UL], said the bill does not protect customers from the cost of switching from fossil fuels. Assemblyman Chris Holden, who held the measure in his Utilities and Energy Committee, said he would consider it again when the legislature returns in January for the second half of their two-year session. The legislature also passed a package of bills aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing in the notoriously expensive state, and approved a plan for spending $1.5 billion in income from the state's cap-and-trade air quality program, which raises money by selling businesses limited rights to emit pollutants. They passed a resolution condemning the election integrity commission, calling it an effort to suppress the voting rights of minorities and others, and voted to move up the state's presidential primary from June to March.

CEO urges SABMiller stockholders to \"voice their views\" on takeover effort By, Editor in Chief, CSP Daily News Steve Holtz October 08, 2015 <mark>Carlos Brito</mark> LONDON & LEUVEN, Belgium--The possibility of Anheuser-Busch InBev purchasing SABMiller began to drift into hostile territory this morning as AB InBev CEO <mark>Carlos Brito</mark> urged stockholders of the coveted No. 2 beer brewer to \"voice their views\" and \"not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this process .\" The comments came in a brief statement from AB InBev expressing surprise over the SABMiller board of directors' swift rejection of an offer--AB InBev's third bid--to purchase the London-based company for \u00a3 42.15 per share in cash ($64.51 per share U.S.). The offer values the company at $104 billion. \"AB InBev is surprised that the board of SABMiller (excluding the directors nominated by SABMiller's largest shareholder, Altria Group Inc., who dissented) continues to say that this proposal\" still very substantially undervalues SABMiller,' \"AB InBev wrote .\" This lacks credibility because the cash proposal represents a premium of approximately 44% to SABMiller's closing share price of \u00a3 29.34 on Sept. 14 (being the last business day prior to renewed speculation of an approach from AB InBev); and Altria Group Inc., which owns 27% of SABMiller and has three representatives on the board, has publicly stated that it supports our proposal and \"urges SABMiller's board to engage promptly and constructively with AB InBev to agree on the terms of a recommended offer .'\" SABMiller, however, said the offer \"has been timed opportunistically to take advantage of SABMiller's recently depressed share price .\" \"SABMiller is the crown jewel of the global brewing industry, uniquely positioned to continue to generate decades of stand-alone future volume and value growth for all SABMiller shareholders from highly attractive markets,\" said Jan du Plessis, chairman of SABMiller. \"AB InBev needs SABMiller but has made opportunistic and highly conditional proposals, elements of which have been deliberately designed to be unattractive to many of our shareholders. AB InBev is very substantially undervaluing SABMiller .\" Some analysts believe AB InBev making its third offer publicly--two lower previous offers were handled quietly--was a first step at riling up shareholders, allowing them to see what they are missing. But certainly encouraging them to \"voice their views\" is an effort to create unrest. \"Notwithstanding our good faith efforts, the board of SABMiller has refused to meaningfully engage with us,\" <mark>Brito</mark> said today. \"Our proposal creates significant value for everybody. How long will it be before shareholders see a value of over \u00a3 42 in the absence of an offer from AB InBev? If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should voice their views and should not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this process and let this opportunity slip away .\" Based on British law, AB InBev has until Wednesday, Oct. 14, to make the deal happen or request an extension.

The protests broke out after a peaceful vigil for Georgia Tech student Scout Schultz, 21, who was fatally shot by police late Saturday night after he called 911 to report an armed and possibly intoxicated suspicious person, authorities said. A police vehicle was set on fire, two officers suffered minor injuries and one officer was transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries during the\" violent protests on campus, \"according to the university. The university estimated that a about 50 people participated in the protests, including some who marched to the the Georgia Tech Police Department immmdiately after the\" peaceful memorial vigil \"for Schultz. At one point, Georgia Tech police ordered students to stay inside and lock their doors, while off-campus students were told to remain off campus .\" Seek shelter in a secure location until further notice. Lock all doors and windows. Take Immediate Action Now, \"the Georgia Tech Department said in a tweet at 9:28 p.m. Monday.

Police said they restored order by 11 p.m. Monday and gave students the\" all clear \"to resume normal activities. Three people were arrested and charged with inciting a riot and battery of an officer, a university spokesperson said. Police told students to\" expect additional patrols throughout campus tonight \"and asked them to report\" anything suspicious. \"In a statement released through attorney <mark>Chris Stewart</mark>, Schultz's family urged protesters to remain peaceful .\" [W] e ask that those who wish to protest Scout's death do so peacefully. Answering violence with violence is not the answer, \"the statement said .\" Our goal is to work diligently to make positive change at Georgia Tech in an effort to ensure a safer campus for all students. \"\"Scout's family respects the rights of those who wish to voice opposition to what they feel was an unnecessary use of force, but they ask that it be done respectfully and safely,\" the statement added. Earlier on Monday, <mark>Stewart</mark> described Schultz as a loving child who lost his life simply because the police overreacted. He said Schultz was barefoot and \"disoriented,\" in the middle of a \"mental breakdown\" when he was shot. \"Scout should not have been shot,\" <mark>Stewart</mark> told reporters Monday. \"There has to be a bigger value put on taking a human life than fear when you are doing your job .\" <mark>Stewart</mark> also accused the school of handling the situation poorly and pushing a narrative that Schultz was a \"knife-wielding\" threat despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Scout Schultz's father, William Schultz, said Schultz had a 3.9 GPA and was scheduled to graduate in December. Scout Schultz served as president of the Georgia Tech Pride Alliance, and a leading voice within the campus' LGBTQ community. Scout Schultz identified as nonbinary and intersex and prefers to use the pronouns they, them and their, according to the group's web site.

His comments were believed to be the first direct message ever issued by a North Korean leader. However, <mark>Kim</mark>'s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said North Korea could consider a hydrogen bomb test of an unprecedented scale on the Pacific Ocean, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Ri, who was talking to reporters in New York ahead of a planned address later this week, however also said he did not know <mark>Kim</mark>'s exact thoughts, according to the report. Japan, the only country ever to suffer an atomic attack, described the threat as \"totally unacceptable\". Trump said in his first address to the United Nations on Tuesday he would \"totally destroy\" North Korea, a country of 26 million people, if it threatened the United States and its allies, and called <mark>Kim</mark> a \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission. <mark>Kim</mark> said the North would consider the \"highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history\" against the United States and that Trump's comments had confirmed his own nuclear programme was \"the correct path\". Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a programme aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. \"I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire,\" <mark>Kim</mark> said in the statement carried by the KCNA state news agency, referring to Trump. \"SLEEPWALKING INTO WAR\" Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he could not recall such a statement in the first person, authored and signed by <mark>Kim</mark>. \"I don't think it's happened before. That's something to take seriously alone,\" he said. The escalating rhetoric came even as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for statesmanship to avoid \"sleepwalking\" into a war. South Korea, Russia and China all urged calm. Also Watch: However, the rhetoric was starting to rattle some in the international community. French Sports Minister Laura Flessel said France's team would not travel to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in South Korea if its security cannot be guaranteed. The 2018 Games are to be staged in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, the world's most heavily armed border. Asian stocks fell and the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained on the possibility of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan handed back earlier gains and was down 0.4 percent after falling 0.7 percent the previous day. MORE TIME In his sanctions announcement on Thursday, Trump stopped short of going after Pyongyang's biggest trading partner, China, praising as \"tremendous\" a move by its central bank ordering Chinese banks to stop doing business with North Korea. The additional sanctions on Pyongyang, including on its shipping and trade networks, showed that Trump was giving more time for economic pressures to weigh on North Korea after warning about the possibility of military action on Tuesday. Asked ahead of a lunch meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Thursday if diplomacy was still possible, Trump nodded and said: \"Why not?\" Trump said the new executive order on sanctions gives further authorities to target individual companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea. It \"will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind\" , Trump said. The U.S. Treasury Department now had authority to target those that conduct \"significant trade in goods, services or technology with North Korea\". Trump did not mention Pyongyang's oil trade. The White House said North Korea's energy, medical, mining, textiles, and transportation industries were among those targeted and that the U.S. Treasury could sanction anyone who owns, controls or operates a port of entry in North Korea. \"ON NOTICE\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said banks doing business in North Korea would not be allowed to also operate in the United States. \"Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea, but not both,\" Mnuchin said. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who addressed the U.N. General Assembly, said sanctions were needed to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table, but Seoul was not seeking North Korea's collapse. \"All of our endeavours are to prevent war from breaking out and maintain peace,\" Moon said in his speech. He warned the nuclear issue had to be managed stably so that \"accidental military clashes will not destroy peace\". The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.
