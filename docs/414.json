Thank you for your patience in this regard .--<mark>David McKay</mark> (editor) & team Stocks mixed, yen slides to lowest since March 0 minutes ago Dollar gains before US jobs report, stocks rise Sydney - The yen tumbled to the weakest since March after Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it's crucial for inflation to exceed the 2% target. Stocks were mixed after China's central bank chief warned again about excessive leverage and President Donald Trump brought up trade grievances on a trip to the region. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index reversed losses after dropping the most in more than two weeks in the wake of People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan's latest salvo on the continuing accumulation of financial risks. Japanese equities were little changed after the yen's decline offered support earlier. Kuroda underscored in a speech Monday that the BOJ is committed to overshooting its inflation goal, auguring no appetite for tapering stimulus. Oil extended an advance above $55 a barrel, with traders keeping an eye on the surprise power shakeup in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. Iron ore climbed percent. \"Governor Kuroda is repeating what he said after the BoJ's meeting last week but the dollar-yen is getting more support as the market starts to anticipate dollar divergence becoming a key driver again of price action,\" said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, head of currency strategy in Singapore at NatWest Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland. \"The BoJ, like other major central banks, is signaling it will not lift interest rates anytime for the foreseeable future. In contrast, the Fed continues to stress its tightening bias. That is laying the conditions for a broader-based rally for the greenback across the board .\" Trump in Tokyo on Monday complained of unfair trade with Japan, pressing the country to step up investment in the US. He goes on to South Korea and China this week, with further prospects for trade tensions to pop up. Read more on Trump's trip to Asia here. Over the weekend, the president claimed credit for the rise in US stocks, which on Friday capped the longest run of weekly advances since 2013. The anti-corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia has ensnared top officials and billionaires, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, known for his investments in companies such as Citigroup and Apple. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul All Share Index fell as much as 2.2% on Sunday before erasing losses to end up 0.3%. Kingdom, Alwaleed's investment vehicle, tumbled 7.6%. News on central bankers also will be closely watched. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley is close to announcing his retirement, according to CNBC. His early departure would mean the top three positions at the Fed changing over within a relatively short period. Trump announced last week that Fed Governor Jerome Powell will be nominated to replace Janet Yellen when her term expires in February. Vice Chairperson Stanley Fischer retired in mid-October. Friday's US payrolls data provided a mixed picture of the strength of the labour market, though distortions from the hurricanes in August made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Based on fed fund futures, the odds for a rate hike in December were little changed.

The Spurs striker went off 14 minutes from the end of Sunday's success at Wembley after receiving treatment in the first half. Pochettino also believes Dele Alli will recover from a hamstring problem in time for his club's next game with north London rivals Arsenal, even if he is missing England duty for the matches with Germany and Brazil. But he was unsure whether Harry Winks will have to withdraw from Gareth Southgate's squad after the midfielder went off with an ankle injury in a below-par victory where Spurs failed to hit the heights of their thrilling midweek 3-1 success over Real Madrid in the Champions League. \"<mark>Kane</mark> was subbed because after 75 minutes we wanted to protect him,\" said Pochettino. \"After Real Madrid it was such an emotional game, it was better to avoid risk. I think he's OK and I'm sure he will go with the international team .\" The former Southampton manager added: \"Harry Winks twisted his ankle in the first half, it's a little bit painful, we must assess him with our medical staff and the national team medical staff .\" He is so excited to be with the national side but now it is up to the medical staff to assess the player. \"Dele felt his tendon at the end of the Manchester United game close to his hamstring and then played 90 minutes against Real Madrid. It is a very small thing. It was not a massive risk to play him here and we hope he can be ready for Arsenal .\" Spurs were disappointing against Palace in a match where the deadlock was not broken until the 64th minute thanks to Son Heung-Min's 20-yard drive. \"It was very difficult,\" admitted Pochettino. \"We knew after Real Madrid it would be a massive challenge to compete again. In the end I'm very pleased, the team was very professional .\" It was a game where we had possession and dominated but we conceded a lot of chances. You need some luck to win and it was a good performance. \"\"Deserved more' Palace remain bottom and are five points from safety but the Eagles can feel aggrieved with Wilfried Zaha missing their best chance when he fired wide at 0-0 after rounding debutant goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga .\" I will be leaving Wembley as a loser, which didn't happen much when I was here for four years, \"said Palace's former England manager Roy Hodgson .\" We created chances and had moments where we were even on top against an illustrious side. We deserved more than what we had. \"But in football you get what you get. You don't get what some people think you deserve .\" Hodgson added: \"We look at the table and we are still on four points. But globally there is not a lot I can accuse my players of. The confidence is fragile but when the goal went in we could have collapsed and lose by three or four .\" They (Tottenham) have players who can punish you.

Perhaps some thirteen billion years. Harvard Astrophysicist, Avi Loeb speaks on the surprising habitability of planets in the early Universe far earlier than the creation of the Milky Way. Surprisingly, temperatures in the early cosmos were similar to those on Earth today. The cosmological conditions for life were in place far earlier than commonly thought. The NASA image at the top of the page shows one of the first stars, which formed around 13.7 billion years ago. The discovery was made by lead researcher <mark>Stefan Keller</mark> of The Australian National University and the results were published in Nature. Dr. <mark>Keller</mark>'s team operates the SkyMapper telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales. Because elements heavier than helium are forged in the cores of stars, the first ones were made mostly out of hydrogen. The telescope is able to detect these first stars because the low iron content influences their color. Using this technique to find early stars, the SkyMapper is currently in a 5-year-long survey, mapping the ancient Southern sky. This star formed so early in our Universe's history, was most likely a second-generation star. Because of the chemical composition, astronomers can gather information about the earlier primordial star, which is believed to be 60 times more massive than our sun and composed of hydrogen and helium.

Modi said a young person of 22-25 years cannot even imagine what Gujarat was in the past when casteism and communalism \"destroyed\" it. \"Now, some power-hungry elements are playing the same dirty game. Now, it is our collective responsibility to save Gujarat from the evils of casteism, communalism and dynastic politics,\" the message read.

Lopez, who joined the club's front office in December 2014, had his contract expire and the Rapids said they decided not to bring him back. \"There's no doubt it's going to be an offseason overhaul in here,\" Rapids interim general manager Padraig Smith told The Denver Post on Tuesday. \"Both on the field and off the field .\" Smith said the Rapids plan to restructure their front office with the hire of a new assistant general manager, director of player personnel and a head of sports science. He said the team hopes to fill the positions with outside hires by the start of preseason.

Smith said the new coach will have a plan and track record of executing that vision.

In the weeks since the season ended, Smith has had one-on-one conversations with all players on the roster and informed each one whether the club would pick up their options, but would not go into detail yet on which players would not return. \"I obviously want to speak to all the other MLS clubs as well to see if there's a potential deals in place,\" Smith said.
