consider when he was at his best in st. louis and arizona, he teamed with the best receiving corps in the game at the time. when warner was with the giants relatively pedestrian receivers, he struggled. also, warner has said the reason he was so dynamic this past season was because he knew the offense. if warner has to go through a steep learning curve, expect the new <mark>york</mark> giants' warner, the guy who throws interceptions, gets sacked and fumbles. that's why it's so crucial that the 49ers approximate the offense of former arizona offensive coordinator todd haley if they can pull off the coup of signing him. email) | march 02 2009 at 10:35 am this story is great blog material but other than that...a complete waste of everyone's time. they should be spending the money on a hard hitting safety like jermaine phillips and a tackle like khalif barnes which both play into <mark>singletary</mark>'s defense first, smash mouth attack. then get a pash rusher in the draft unless they can trade back, get more picks and still pick up sanchez or stafford if they fall in the draft. kurt-o-claus is coming to town! i read somewhere that this kind of move indicates jed york is showing a new, more aggressive style of ownership! this will at least force the tards to up the offer to warner and eat cap space! good for jed! jimmy raye's best quality as a coach is finding a way to use his players the best way! he will be able to get warner going here too! no way warner signs here. he's a poor fit and really not what the niners need right now. this would certainly fall under the \"holy sheepsh! t' heading of fa signings. - go slim pickens!!! - it would be a stop-gap signing, but it would get them pretty far in the west this year. if they did do this, they would then have to address their line immediately. sign barnes and/or someone else (runyan? pace?) and draft a couple more guys. they could still go after e brown in the 1st round, but the 2nd and 4th round picks would have to be ots and maybe my guy from slo in the 3rd round - ramses. i would be crazy to say that bringing in kurt warner would be a bad thing. but i really like what we've got going with shaun and the power running philosophy that the niners are trying to implement. we finally have a coach who has a system in place that he wants to run for years to come. and to change that structure because of one player is risky. i say stick with what you have and bolster that defense and o-line through the draft. instead of kurt warner visiting, the 49ers should be getting <mark>jay cutler</mark> on the phone. apparently he can be had for a first. now your talkin primafacie! is there really evidence of that? we should jump on it! <mark>jay cutler</mark> is angry with the fiasco over the weekend when a three-way between denver, tampa bay and new england falling apart. it would have put matt cassell with the broncos, <mark>cutler</mark> in tampa and a first with the patriots. . buying opportunity. . i don't think signing warner would be a coup, especially at the price he'll command. as <mark>keith</mark> points out, he had very pedestrian years when he was throwing to average receivers. and do we really thing that johnny raye will be able to\" approximate \"todd haley's offense, even if <mark>mike singletary</mark> gave him the ok? aw man you had me excited but. ., we don't want to trade <mark>jay</mark>,\" mcdaniels said saturday. \"we never did. he's our quarterback .\" ...that was a compilcated deal, i don't think we can put together a package like that. mcdaniels was after cassell his ex qb...pmh9erfan...jimmy raye would be able to get the most out of having warner if we did get him!. why shell out all of that dough for a guy who will play one, maybe two seasons for us and be gone. . i could see why the jets did it...it was favre. . warner is no favre!. bad move imo.... posted by: kauairobert | march 02 2009 at 11:29 am regardless of what kurt warner did last season and when he was with the rams i have little to no faith in him as a football player and least of all as a quarterback. in both situations where he won he had the most ridiculous wide recievers in the game which took most if not all the pressure off of him at the qb position. he's an arena league qb parading as an nfl qb because when he succeeds all he has had to do is throw the ball deep and the amazing recievers just go get it. he can't scramble, he still holds the ball too long, and we want to run a power running offense. he doesn't fit the 49ers offensive plans, our offensive personnel doesn't fit warner and frankly <mark>singletary</mark> and warner together would be way too much god talk for the bay area. it's a step backwards for the 49ers who should be looking more at development of a qb than a has been who was never really a qb in the true definition of the word. they should be pressing denver hard for <mark>cutler</mark>. the pats already set the market at a 2nd round pick. hey <mark>kevin</mark> do we have to sign warner's wife to a contract too since she's the leader of the household and spokes woman for the warner family? - what a pathetic ownership we have here, it started from the automatic hiring of <mark>singletary</mark> with his 5-4 pristine record and without bothering to look at what was available, the hiring of raye and now warner. this ownership are not only a bunch of tight wod's but are clueless on how to run a winning nfl franchise properly. - but hey they're very lucky to have <mark>kevin lynch</mark> as their ambassador of spineless reporting and a whole lot of fans like unca_chuck who accept anything and just move on. if they were doing a reality show to see how far and gullible fans can be taken for a ride by their teams ownership then i'd understand but this is insanity and should be considered a crime. i'd be willing to bet that warner is in \"get paid\" mode. the cards rejected him and told him he wasn't worth 12-15 million a year. he thinks he is, and with all the wasted millions the niners throw around (see most recent signing), why not throw another couple mill at warner to get lienert prematurely playing, fitz frustrated, and the d's stacking the box against the cards' newly acquired running backs (in this year's draft). it's a win / win anyway you slice it, but this group of dumbies will screw it up six ways from sunday. pay warner a lot o' dough!!!! well, i'll be damned. if this comes to fruition, i'll have to come up with some new grocery clerk material. it won't be easy, but i'll do it. you guys can count on me. . good post bra!...~ aloha ~ here's a funny one...i was on the broncos website looking for <mark>cutler</mark> news...they have a picture of nolan up there hahahahahahahahaha if a qb is all this team needed to compete and win a championship, this would be the greatest day ever. but we need to be able to keep him upright and play solid d. i don't think we are there yet and would rather see ol and db addressed before we worry about a qb. hill will be just fine this year. we can address the qb \"need\" after the season when the rest are covered. in my opinion. - that is of course, unless they plan on bringing in an actual wr like tj...brmgd30! good post! there are actually people on here who think we should sign warner and draft a querterback with our #1 pick!!!! sheeesh...we might as well put 5 offensive tackles and 4 quarterbacks on the field every play! hey kauai! i agree, \"warner is no favre!\" but something tells me, both will end up in canton someday. bring back joe and steve! i'm always looking for conspiracies. i can't help but believe the rumors about vick, warner coming in, are for shaun hill. maybe sing wants to scare the pants off of him (so to speak) to become a true full season 1st string qb. maybe he's trying to soften the blow of kicking hill back to 2nd string (with <mark>alex</mark>, with <mark>cutler</mark>?). maybe he's setting the stage for getting sanchez. maybe it's just jerking the cards. i sure enjoy speculating...warner is in the niners complex now! he took a physical and is talking to our guys now! oh, that's what that lear jet flying over my house this morning was. i thought it was larry ellison again. no, no, no, no! did i fall asleep and wake up and the niners had an excellent, deep, wide receiver corps? and get a successful pass-blocking ol? kiss off rebuilding the lines if you sign warner. at least we know why scotty didn't splurge on fa so far. i just * hope * he's playing poker and raising the stakes for the cards. puh-lease...the biggest mistake the 49ers made was not going after gm scott pioli the braintrust of the new england patriots.now he's on his way to making the chiefs respectable again getting cassel for a 2d round pick a brillant move.does anyone think mcclueless could pull that off with <mark>jay cutler</mark> and denver? jayson <mark>taylor</mark> is now available for $8.5 mil. screw kurt warner (no offense, future hof), and take <mark>alex</mark> with you...warner as the starter with hill as his backup would be far better than hill with <mark>smith</mark>... (heaven forbid a <mark>smith</mark> with hill scenario). with warner, vd wouldn't have to catch with his fingers wide or low anymore, one of his key weaknesses as a pass catcher, because warner can hit him on the numbers every time. we haven't anybody with his kind of accuracy since joe and steve. the only problem would be that vd would be doing too much strutting around with his new found \"ability\". and then we could still draft e. brown (or sanchez as an apprentice qb if brown is gone) with the first pick. after looking it up, maybe <mark>jason</mark> is more interested in dancing now than his 6 pro-bowl appearances as a pass-rushing de. sing would change that in a hurry. reno, big, where are you? would he fit into a 3-4, or am i just blowing $8.5 mil worth of smoke again? \"we don't want to trade <mark>jay</mark>,\" mcdaniels said saturday. \"we never did. he's our quarterback .\". you believe him? josh mcdaniels was ready to dump <mark>jay cutler</mark> for matt cassell, which says how highly he thinks of <mark>cutler</mark>. sez here next year's no. 1 does it. here's my two cent opinion that i posted on the last thread. i just don't see warner on our team. i guess if we picked up holt, pace, and with bruce we could be the geriatric greatest show on grass. god, please don't let that happen. news flash - i just got off the phoe with a bud from high school. he let me know that the the most popular sporting goods store we used to shop at is being bought by dicks sporting goods. the place used to be called chick's. no word on whether it will now be called chicks with dicks! pursuing and then signing warner would have made all the sense in the world - if we still had martz. as is, i find the news tepid. i don't mind that martz is gone but hell, i would mind if we get warner and now no more martz to pair him up with. reno, what about <mark>jason taylor</mark>? this question's right up your alley, my good friend...the warner signing is great from two angles...first we get a great qb and stiff the cards and...wait for it...finally dump <mark>alex</mark> smiths 13 mill a contract for warners 13 mill a year contract so we break even and still have all the cap space to blow on another failure of a signing hey sidewinder - \"the greatest geriactic show on grass .\" that's good turf! add that, to my broken left hip. now we're talking! just you wait, i'm gonna beat next year in our fantasy football league. if i make it that long...i like <mark>jason</mark> tylor but don't know what he has left. i really don't know what to think. i'd be inclined to think he's not worth 8.5 mil. i also think if he is worth it mcsing will be calling. - i must get back to work but the chicks with dicks story is true. hey reno - chicks with dicks? you gave me the wrong 900 number again. posted by: del_mar_dennis | march 02 2009 at 01:51 pm reno, there used to be a biker bar about 5 miles from here on the road to my favorite city in the world, los gatos. played pool there - badly, but i wasn't a biker. sold, turned into a gay bar named \"friends\". never went there. didn't last long, i think bikers from all over the west kept showing up...jake2007 - if the 9ers do pick up warner, i certainly don't see them drafting a qb in the 1st round. a qb selected with the 10th pick would be earning as much as most starters in the league. as a reference point, joe flacco was taken 18th overall and got a 5-year, $30m deal. that's in 2008. you have to believe a guy like sanchez taken at #10 in 2009 would command something in the $7 - $8m range. combine that with the $14m/yr warner wants and the $2m/yr they're paying hill and you have the world's most expensive stable of quarterbacks. that said, maybe they'll spend a second day pick on a guy who won't wring them dry. hey reno - if you could promise me this, i'll make it up by draft day. *** if they do somehow end up with warner, the timimg would be awful screwy seeing as how martz left the building a while ago. would it mean we'd go after holt and pace? posted by: unca_chuck | march 02 2009 at 02:15 pm hey dennis - you'll make it. and i am sure it will be just a fun as last year. this is some crazy stuff with warner though. - asmith - like you said, if we could just flip-flop <mark>smith</mark> and warner's expected salary, so we could kick <mark>smith</mark> to the curb, without it costing too much, i'm all for it. - what in the wide wide world of sports is a goin on here?...where's the white women?...and where the hell are vernon \"aint gonna do ya no good no how\" davis's trade papers at? - kurt warner huh?...drop <mark>alex</mark> and give the $'s to kurt instead for two years, also screwing our \"newest\" division rival?...sounds good in theory so far:)... then we draft a qb somewhere on the third round to take the reigns over when warner's gone?...where does hill fit in? - he'd have to change his number out of respect to mr. warner:)... be his back-up...hmmmm...something will go wrong, sing might drop trow in front of kurts wife or something during the \"meeting\" - how'd you like that ass whoopin i put on ya in the nascar del:) - and p.s., why not take a flyer on <mark>jason taylor</mark>, seeing as we're not signing any ot's in free agency.... guess they like jennings? the entire charade about warner goes to show how unsettled <mark>singletary</mark> is on our back-up passing as a starter s. hill. let the ridculous <mark>alex smith</mark> go. pleeeze. go get <mark>cutler</mark>. he is lightyears better than any qb in this mediocre draft. if warner is signed look for bruce to stay!:) wow, v. a new record. your 12,983,036 post saying the same thing. - are you as tired of typing this sh! t as we are of reading it? apparently not. get a life. better yet, get a job. hey \"faithful! that's what i've been trying to tell these people...\"my name is jim, but most people call me...jim\" maybe you should eat something, first? \"no thanks. food makes me sick .\" \"a man drink like that, and he don't eat, he's gonna die .\" \"when?\" posted by: del_mar_dennis | march 02 2009 at 03:12 pm arizona today signed <mark>keith lewis</mark>. seems like a fair trade: <mark>lewis</mark> for kurt warner. damn chuck, was just thinking that v pretty much copy's and paste's his blogs:) - but \"v\" , you and i have had our words, just a couple of times...you seem to be bright, and yet you still are caught up in the past? - don't you \"feel\" something familiar with jed debartolo pulling the strings now? - yep, i said it...he's not <mark>john york</mark>! - a <mark>york</mark>, would not have the balls to send a private jet to phoenix to pick up kurt and the little mrs., then drive them around in a stretch limo to and from headquarters, the hostpital, etc. - it's a debartolo move...one his uncle eddy was famous for:)... the kids got balls, the want to win, he actually seems like he doesn't like losing (uncle eddy perhaps?) - he's going after a hall of fame qb (yes, he was a ram at one time) who i am sure you would rather have the ball in his gloved hands than anyone we've put out on the field since garcia right? - flow with it my guitar wielding friend, stop with the constant whining of the past, the yorks, nolan...this could be our division again!!!! - or, we could just be sheep being led down the yorks fiery path to hell:) - i got my $on little jed debartolo, seeing that he seems to have more of that blood running through his veins, than his no football knowing dr. daddy! - he aint acting like a <mark>york</mark>!!!!.... just sayin...but he also hasn't traded away vernon \"brickhouse\" davis yet either:)... so six in one hand, half dozen in the other...but it'd be nice to know warner was under center for the next two years, instead of doing another deal for the inaccurate <mark>smith</mark> right? move for the niners. last year he had the best receivers in the league and excellent protection--the niners would give him neither and he would be his old fumbling self. the only reason his signing is possible is because the niners are so stupid!!! jed and mcclueless--what a team--i pray to the most high that sf does not sign warner. three negatives: 1. we don't have the personal at wr. 2. we got rid of m. martz, which warner would be able to excel under. 3. we can't protect him, he's not mobile at all. thanks for the visit and then get lost kurt. the only reason dr. <mark>york</mark> was involved in the nfl at all was because of a couple incidents. eddie d. got booted out of league for his felony involvement southern gambling casinos (i don't remember, riverboat?). his sister denise took over. denise was clueless, but sure wasn't going to give up a $1 billion business that eddie made so much money on over the years. denise is married to dr. <mark>york</mark>. he has been running the team for years. we've seen how that's gone. jed's running the team now. with sing as hc. 391 king street west chatham ontario n7m 1g3 canada barefeet possess barefeet pictures of kurt warner posted by: bigred55a | march 02 2009 at 04:17 pm true, warner is no favre. favre only played in one super bowl, and sabotaged two teams on his way out to pasture. if kurt warner wants to be a 49er...sign him up!!!!! why would any team pass on kurt warner? he's one of the best in the nfl!!! why not? it's irresponsible not to. kurt warner can adjust to any offense and its personnel. he's a professional football player for christ's sake. we paid <mark>alex smith</mark> all that money for absolutely nothing!!!!! kurt warner is no <mark>alex smith</mark>. why any 49er fan would settle for the qb's we have already is beyond me. i want to win now. kurt warner gives us the best chance to win now...after the past 7-8 years why we want to postpone winning now for the future doesn't make any sense at all. gooooo kurt warner. and referencing his stint with the giants.... and when he first signed with arizona...his mechanics were changed...and he did what he had to do to be successful in this league...<mark>alex smith</mark> could learn from that. if it takes $14 million per to sign kurt warner, wouldn't that money be better spent on, say, <mark>jay cutler</mark>, a guy to build around? a 37 -, 38-year-old quarterback could go at any minute. chuck, actually the warner topic was just brought up only a few days ago and about you being a spineless, gutless and accepting everything and just moving on, i will continue to bring it up until you stop your puppet dangling ways. - faithful, the <mark>york</mark>'s hiring of <mark>singletary</mark>, raye and now warner happen not that long ago so please don't make it seem like i been talking about warner for years. with that said going after warner who's one hit away from being in a wheel chair isn't what i call a great free agent prospect and it's one out of many bad moves the <mark>york</mark>'s have made since their arrival. again if this happened to be a reality show the <mark>york</mark>'s were putting on to see how far they can take all the gullible 49ers fans for a ride before they said enough is enough well then i would understand. it's obvious it won't work with fans like you and unca_chuck because like v said before you'll accept anything including an all female 49ers team, flag football and much, much more and will never complain and will always have a smile. - when the last time the <mark>york</mark>'s went after a real free agent signing instead of the bottom of the barrel prospects? tell me i'm waiting...what bruce another person who's one hit away from being in a wheel chair himself. do you see a real winning organization like the patriots going after these bottom of the barrel players? no it's only the 49ers who are trying to penny pinch their way to a championship and in reality it doesn't work that way. what happened to you fans has your expectations falling so low that anything is better than nothing? an 8-8 season is your super bowl championship. has it got just that bad that your really don't expect much out of your team and any progress is better than none? these little moves and trades made by this pathetic ownership with the hopes it will lead us to a super bowl victory is pure insanity and you fans that buy into this nonsense and move on with balles chuck and his white flag of surrender is the real problem we face in america today. _ chuck, for v saying things as they really are and bringing out the truth i would prefer you calling me a raider fan or a nazi like most liberals do when they don't want to hear a mans point of view. \"favre only played in one super bowl...\"yeah, i know...would've edited if i could've. malcolm jenkins -

which passed the house last week - to meet a friday deadline. that's when a stopgap funding law that keeps the government going, mostly at 2008 levels, runs out. senate majority leader <mark>harry reid</mark>, d-nev., is also trying to keep the <mark>bill</mark> free of floor amendments that would force the measure into negotiations with the house that would delay enactment. but that means democrats will have to cast some politically difficult votes. one of the most uncomfortable could come wednesday on an amendment by tom coburn, r-okla., to kill 13 so-called earmarks requested by lawmakers for projects sought by pma group, a lobbying company at the center of a federal corruption investigation. the pma group, which recently folded, had a reputation for funneling campaign money to lawmakers that obtained earmarks for its clients and is under investigation by the justice department over whether the company reimbursed some employees for campaign contributions to members of congress who requested the projects. on cuba, menendez is upset by a provision that would restore travel rules permitting people to visit relatives in cuba once every 12 months. president george w. bush imposed rules in 2004 that limited travel to just two weeks every three years and confined visits to immediate family members. the omnibus <mark>bill</mark> also would lift restrictions on financing imports of u.s. food and medicine into cuba and effectively reverse bush administration rules requiring \"cash-in-advance\" payment. \"if the omnibus <mark>bill</mark> is signed by the president as is, he will be extending a hand while the castro regime maintains its iron-handed clenched fist,\" menendez said monday. the underlying legislation will need at least a few gop votes to clear a key legislative hurdle later this week. sen. thad cochran, r-miss., the appropriations committee's top republican, is the only republican so far to publicly announce support for the <mark>bill</mark>, though other old-school gop panel members are likely to help the <mark>bill</mark> along - in large part because of the many earmarks they have obtained. we welcome your participation in our community. please keep your comments civil and on point. you must be at least 13 years of age to post comments. by submitting a comment, you agree to these all content \u00a9 copyright 2002 -
